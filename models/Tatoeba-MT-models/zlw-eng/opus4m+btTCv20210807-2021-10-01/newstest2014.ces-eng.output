A black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying hard to find money to repair the falling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black cabinet that easily fits into your car’s instrument board.
A device that tracks every mile that a motorist goes away, and which transmits this information to the authorities, is at the heart of Washington’s controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renovate an outdated system of funding for U.S. main roads.
Usually falsity in the design of highways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
The libertarians met with groups of ecologists and lobbyed to allow the government to use these small cabinets, which would record miles and maybe even where you are going - and then use this information to build a tax dimension.
Tea party's scared.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states do not expect anything.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system where the driver pays for the mileage of the road he is driving.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black cabinets, some of which have GPS surveillance, to test.
This is a real necessity for our people.
“It’s not a matter where we can choose too much,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to start monitoring the miles that have been taken for this state at every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used.
The fact is that the Road Trust Fund, financed by taxes that Americans pay for gas stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by only one cent.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed tracking devices in 500 cars to test this payment system for a mile.
“From a long-term perspective, it seems to be the most logical alternative,” he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of miles that have passed.
It is no surprise that this idea likes urban liberals, because taxes can be used to change the patterns of driver behavior, which, for example, can help to limit traffic jams and create greenhouse gases.
California designers look at this system in planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transport Committee, said he also saw it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to pay drivers for mileage.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of the Reason strategy.
People pay directly for what they receive.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called for Congress to go towards paying for a kilometre.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project to cover about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives' leadership rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the population, whose daily life often means insulting many kilometers of work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
Oregon is one of the largest experiments in the country, involving 5,000 drivers.
These drivers will soon start paying a tax for mileage instead of a gasoline tax.
Nevada has completed the pilot project.
New York is currently exploring the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent for trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 State Departments of Transport, along with coastal states in the East (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept is not just an advocate.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor every move.
“The concerns about Big Brother tracking and similar issues were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who leads the management of the strategy and operation at the Nevada Department of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the test project continued, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.
There is no need to build an enormously difficult-falling technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to the register of daily trips and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the several states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometers a car will run, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
Hon on such technology has brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was initially not involved in the action to assist the government in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging market with legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they go.
But this device, which it tests, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and provides only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using modems.
“People will be more willing to do this if you don’t track their speed and their location,” says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have occurred in some of these pilot programs.
They are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they may not take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places, they hope that the prudential public will approach this concept if the device is able to do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop tax facilities that could be equipped to pay parking hours to provide insurance by mileage and collect data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be willing to take part in this because of the value of the benefits they are offered,” the city’s projection document said.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussions about paying per kilometre are not just a huge problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the San Francisco Bay region say Congress could easily solve the problem with the bankrupt Road Credit Fund by raising its gas tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
“There is no need for a radical operation when it is sufficient to take aspirin richly,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislative and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka is negotiating for the ČSSD.
Social democracies are drolí, the peoples and the grandmothers are speaking together and preparing a common approach.
If the Social Democrats are confused within a few weeks, they will meet at the meeting table with perfectly-played partners who will put a finished list of requirements on the table, including Ministerial posts.
The ČSSD envoys then either the acidic coalition grapes or the quivering minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, after four days of carrying on a wave of sympathy, first encountered him.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political Bureau and, above all, to force convicted liars to resign.
The only one confirmed by the party is he, the other members of the team will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (UVV).
I apologized to the members of the Bureau and now to the citizens.
It is not to lie, in personal life or in public.
“It was a mistake,” said Michal Hašek, the narrowest leader of social democracy.
He added that he was not in the position of the first vice-president.
“I’ll tell you my decision on November 10,” Hašek said.
Similarly, the vice-president of the ČSSD Zdenek Škromach and the head of the member club Jeronym Tejc spoke.
He said he was elected only two days ago.
Both MPs said they would do everything possible to make the 50-member ČSSD club one vote.
Michael Hašek said: “I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to her mark and I have respected the decision of the party authorities.”
Another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget when calling for Sobotk’s resignation and his withdrawal from the negotiating team that the August UVV had agreed that Bohuslav Sobotka was the candidate of the prime minister’s party?
However, the head of the ČSSD made a powerful army of enemies by calling the ICC until next Sunday.
Its opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of the body and the media with a snare of various wires and fami, or to remind of the real mistakes of Sobotk’s political career.
There will be powerful washing of dirty laundry, signs of dark alliances between the coal-barone Zdenek Bakala and the Saturday wing will appear.
The friendly relationship of Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorny will be discussed.
There is a dispute in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the ČSSD.
The warnings are the words of the Ostrava mayor and Sobotk's ally Peter Kajnar: 'Chart 77 I signed to keep the country from being ruled by the idiots'
If I had already met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
The traitors scratch their heads with ash and stay.
And the currently winning head of the ČSSD then ends with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin The Doctor on Problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with Russians is Difficult
His mouth will indicate a small smile, and then he will breathe out deeply: ‘It’s difficult.’
Cooperation with the 2014 Sochi Olympics team is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget what happened at the Olympics.
“Nothing works the same way,” said the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of providing information about essential things no longer so much.
For example, for three months, we’ve been happy to give us how the individual villages will be officially marked so that we can do a whole range of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
They still communicate in a number of things.
Is there an Olympic village?
But it's no longer a catastrophic state.
We walked in empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, the houses stand.
What does it mean to be empty?
Are there any finished floors?
Only the basic concrete, that is, was the condition a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26th as a forerunner, it will still feel glue there.
And if they don't pursue, then what?
President Putin, would you mean an army?
I guess that's what's going to happen.
It's just that it's not that the Olympic village = the Potemkin village.
Rather, they may not be able to change roads, for example, they will not get the details.
They may have roads in such a state that we'll have to take the doves of London's games with us.
But I believe they'll put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, this number changes.
For instance, the figure-breakers are probably going in the trio that they've gone out of.
No one has to doubt about the speed skater Martina Sáblíková, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still waiting for a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26.
What will the houses in the Olympic Village look like, we know?
We even measured some things ourselves by subway so that we wouldn’t just believe sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the boss of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing myself for the annual evaluation of each Olympic sport, plus I am making a common agenda in terms of communication with the organizational committee in Sochi.
Putin pledged an ecological Olympics, a plan for hating a giant secret landfill
Winter sports fans already cut a meter until the opening of the Olympic Games in Sochi, while others look at their preparation with increasing concerns.
The Russian Olympics, even if it starts in February, are facing another scandal.
Russians seem to fail to fulfill the promise that the preparation and conduct of games will not harm nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be targeted in four months.
After the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a bar built very high, and the Canadian Olympics entered the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize games with 'null waste' has long taken his own.
Last week, AP reporters discovered a giant landfill of building material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
Thus, a landfill full of building material, tires, canisters and insulation foam was found already in August by ecologists, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities disappeared.
Just for a moment.
Last week, reporters looked at a landfill about the size of three football fields.
He is not the only one, in the area of such places several, described the British letter The Times.
There are Russian Railways, a state monopoly that builds a 60-metre route between Sochi Airport and the sports resort.
The company, which had already joined 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin’s close co-workers, Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways defended that the landfill was founded by one of the subcontractors.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštyr around the village for three months and nights, he rides trucks full of waste material.
According to experts, waste threatens to contaminate the local River Mzymtu, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
“Water from here contaminates the Sochi water springs for the next ten to fifteen years,” Kimayev, an environmental non-profit organization at EWNC, told British newspaper Vladimir Kimayev.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
In comparison, Sochi games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics went to $43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost only 19 billion and the Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not being respected while working at the sports and infrastructure exhibition.
Last month, one of the workers put his mouth down to protest that he didn’t get paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian game organizers will deal with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple matured on housing with parents, new house offers privacy for both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates received as a assignment to design a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, while the plot itself is somewhat considered.
In addition, it was necessary that there would be two generations in the house who would want to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly motivating plot.
So the architects decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
When creating the proposal, we respected family ties, history and memories associated with the place -
“The three different functions of the house are connected by several paths through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy,” the designers explain.
The home of the parents is at the level of the garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are related.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in different finishes of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was shaped using panels from the planks, the part where the office is, is rejected white and the remaining elements remain in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glassed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very connected with the exterior.
The home of parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior underscores the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
A young couple enters the house by the main entrance to the hall, and from there rises the stairs into their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light through them.
It was by this that the architects tried to distinguish the house from the others and push it something unique.
The home of a young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
It is divided from the terrace only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living area with dining and kitchen part in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space that freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of the Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is taken in a pure combination of white and black colors.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enters the house by the main entrance, finds himself in the entrance hall, and then rises up the stairs.
Defend academic freedom, this applies to both Zeman and ODS.
I have repeatedly called on students, educators and seniors in several regions to defend academic freedom from the election campaign that President Miloš Zeman led in schools over the past few months.
I met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who rejected the lecture of the Honorary President of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received retaliatory in the form of a non-invitation for the celebration of the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer so brave and visited Milos Zeman enabled: Technical University in Brno, Hladnov High School in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Trade Academy in Cologne, J.E. Purkyka University in Usti nad Labem.
We now meet in Pardubice with the continuation of policy enforcement at universities.
A newly elected member of the ODS, a dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and also seems normal to him.
Professor, that's not the same thing as if you're the mayor of a smaller city, for example.
Do you want to rank among the Czech SSD presidents, who at the same time defecate the position of a member and a captain, as well as they degrade both professions?
For this, you tell people that both of these challenging functions can be mastered by the left back.
I know, we have an example of Michal Hašek, who even manages several dozen functions at once.
This may not be the example of a person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who prefers to leave the post of MP so that she can fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the Dean's office is that you will violate the apolitics of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The leadership of the Pardubice ODS sees your current action on both posts as an advantage to the University.
“You will be able to help your school without being a dean.
I think the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig will also have your students.
Consider your withdrawal and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may be counted by the voters in the next election.
And it doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice bubbles of cabbage, they do not add chemistry to it
More than a thousand tons of sour cabbage want to produce in the coming months in the Slovak Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started here in October and will last for about half a year.
He has been producing a healthy delicacy here since 1925 in a traditional way, i.e. by climbing right in big dances.
In modern industrial times it is a rarity.
Our staff found almost a ten-kilometer route in exchange.
Each of the ten tanks will fit fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, the filling of one takes three shifts,” said David Kladroba, the director of the Slovak Fruta race.
The shears of cabbage are carried directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsko and Břeclavsko.
The Fruta staff then cleans the vegetables, removes the bones and throws them into the ring.
From there, cut cabbage falls into the pools of six meters deep, in which tirelessly walkers work dressed in white clothes and doves.
This removes unwanted air.
The last layer of cabbage is covered with sail and loaded with water.
“The green ring will then mature for six to eight weeks during spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of acidification-supporting substances,” said the director of Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic conditions, the individual layers workers spray with salt and cumin.
The cabbage after fermentation goes to the filling line.
It is packed in sweet-acid tincture into bags or glasses and undergoes sterilization.
Hamé supplies sour cabbage mainly to the domestic and Slovak market.
It is also registered in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “co-operate” with Germany in connection with U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence secretary, said he was willing to leave for Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
Mr Snowden’s letter to the media on Friday said: “Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to act like a run-up to the opposition and seeks to criminalize political manifestations with heavy lawsuits that do not give room for defense.
Telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said he believed that supporting the international community could convince the United States government to withdraw the charges of crimes filed against him.
The allegations raised by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we’ll find a way to make it possible.
Tensions in the relationship between the US and Germany began to rise when the claim that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone appeared.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of the parliament’s panel that oversees the news, said that if there was any opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, “without putting himself at risk and completely destroying relations with the U.S., it should be done.
Mr Sträbele, Member of Parliament for the German Greens party, posted a photo of Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would need to make sure he was “safe there,” a member of parliament said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign associated with persecution that forced him to leave his home.
But he said that the world's response to his \"act of political expression\" gave him courage.
Citizens across and high officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the discovery of an unfoundable system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, \"until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved -
We're sorry to kill you, but we're innocent, the Red Khmers are defending each other.
Nuon Chea was the number two in the Red Khmer hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
During the reign of the Khmers, who leaned on a blend of maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, they lost their lives due to exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population at that time.
This commandant of the infamous S-21 prison granted the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010 a life sentence.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, slavery, and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interests of the nation and did not know what the real scope of killing was.
“It is easy to say that I should have known everything, to understand everything, and therefore to intervene and correct the situation,” Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I had no authority,” he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered the Red Khmer cadres to treat or kill people badly to deny food or commit genocide.
But he admitted “moral responsibility” for the dead.
“I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people,” he said.
The 50-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Red Khmer regime, told AFP that she could not accept Nuon Chea’s apology.
- He lied to us -
He wants to be freed from guilt.
“He doesn’t care about others,” she said.
“If he hadn’t given orders, his subordinates wouldn’t have killed,” she added, adding that the leaders of the Khmer Reds were worse than the monsters.
He was also supposed to face the “Minister of Foreign Affairs” regime of the Ieng Sara Red Khmers, who died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012 the court found an incomparable trial for dementia.
The leader of the Red Khmers Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to $100 on board during its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in their announcement on Wednesday they said passengers will be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if passengers with payment wait until arrival at the gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that a hundred-dollar fee would encourage passengers to take care of the payment ahead.
“We wouldn’t like to collect this fee,” she said.
Airlines started charging for their first and second baggage in 2008.
Travellers tried to avoid these fees and creaked in the hand luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often no room in this space.
Fees are one of the ways to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee is not really to get more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in front at Frontier’s gate can bring a baggage he doesn’t pay anything for, while the other passenger in the queue will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said the websites and check-in procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before they arrive at the gate.
The new Frontier charge for hand luggage will not be in effect until the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Travellers often complain about luggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage is worth money, and passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see another baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to collect enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of loss.
Most of them were not charged with hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago, and the other low-cost company Allegiant Air followed the example later.
The only company that also has such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says Air Transport Advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
In a December 2011 report, Spirit estimated that the baggage charge would be $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former chief executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers met with an unusual charge from Spirit for hand luggage.
“Getting on the plane was the busiest thing I’ve ever seen in my aviation career,” he said.
I was hoping to see the teeth and the fights at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, \"and the arrival took place in the mage -
The frontier will also apply coffee, tea, soda and juice charges after Spirit’s model.
The frontier said passengers who get the soda or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be added free of charge.
Water will continue to be served free of charge.
In 2008, U.S. Airways briefly tried to introduce drinks charges, but after complaints from passengers seven months later, no other major airline resembled it.
The last move of Frontier to charge hand luggage, if the passenger does not purchase the flight directly from this airline, is its last attempt to direct customers directly to their website.
The airline pays Internet travel vendors such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, instead of doing so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier went the most far in this area.
In September, she started giving customers who bought over the Internet travel agency only half a mile in the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for the mileage to 25 percent of the mileage.
So the journey with Frontier, a long 1000 miles purchased through an online travel agency, means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and lose money.
According to the financial results reported Wednesday, Republic Airways Holdings sales fell by 9% and transport capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter.
Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier by selling this airline.
In the fall of the NSA website, it does not blame hackers, but “an internal error”
The secret National Security Agency said last Friday that its website fell for several hours last week due to an internal error, not a hacker attack, as some said on the internet.
“The NSA.gov sites were not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update,” the spy agency said in a statement.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a DDoS attack (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors reported that NSA websites did not work for at least six hours, and sites are no longer available to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were “not at risk.”
The spokesperson said no classified information was at risk.
At least one group of hacking activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for decommissioning NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood target websites with information until servers overload and the page falls.
This cyber-tactics is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA supersecret agency, which once acquired the nickname No such agency, has become the center of public attention after the discovery of foreign and domestic surveillance programs in recent months, and the target of biting criticism is the product of alienating NSA secret files from the agency and revealing them to a disillusioned former employee, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has sparked earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of targeted cyber operations.
Bombardier's profit fell as a result of decline in supply and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15% decline in net profit on Thursday, which is due to fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not published any data on the flight test for its new Cseries aircraft, nor has it offered up-to-date information as to whether the aircraft will comply with an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the launch of the test flight, about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times and the question arose whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results did not meet estimates and the stock market in Toronto fell by 8 percent.
Analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced the rating from “higher profitability” to “sector performance” on Thursday, expecting the exchange to experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While we’ve mostly expected smaller aircraft deliveries, we’ve been greatly disappointed by the profit margin in transport,” Doerksen said in a report.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will get new Cseries orders.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market scepticism towards this programme will increase.
Bombardier hopes that Cseries aircraft are fighting into the bottom of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was revealed in March and after a few months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding C Series aircraft orders reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for test flight results to verify the company’s claims regarding low consumption and savings at the cost of this transport aircraft.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, Executive Director, expected to reach 300 binding orders when launching the first aircraft into commercial use.
The executives also assured the analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing according to the plan.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that the country’s testing and software updates were planned during the aircraft’s downtime.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should fly in the coming weeks and the rest shortly thereafter.
Analysts are nevertheless skeptical about the fact that the first customer could start operating the C Series 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier says it has evaluated its plan to launch the aircraft and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight tests, although in line with Bombardier’s internal plan, will probably strengthen our view that the launch will be shifted to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From $172 million or $9 cents per share in the previous year, in the third quarter of September, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted returns per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover margined from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to the IBES, Thomson Reuters analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said only 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier.
Clean orders dropped from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aviation division accounted for 32.9 billion on 30 September, which did not change as of 31 December.
“The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but low order receipt and overall market condition disappointed us,” Beaudoin said.
Aerospace revenue dropped 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said the yield in this division increased by almost 11% to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts accounted for 32.6 billion on 30 September, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Leaders said new perspectives would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced the arrival of Google’s financial director Patrick Pichette, fell by 8.5 percent during trading on Thursday afternoon to $4.83.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, announced a 10% decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the mafia of a police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) was to give information to the king of the underworld to Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come out.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top lawyer who informed a drug mob about a major police investigation because he was afraid that his drug addiction would be revealed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42), after becoming suspected of cocaine use, had the head of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough, to pass on sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities.
The lawyer, whose nickname was \"Bash\" (party) and who was celebrated by criminals as the best legal representative, was arrested at home in 2011.
The police saw Sarborough (32), as he left three bags of cocaine at his lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, just at dinner with his colleagues from the Legal Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried to earn responsibly information about the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were then investigated in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After arresting heroin and cocaine worth about £1.5 million, along with £200,000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in prison.
Ditta (42) gave information to criminals for fear of becoming addicted to cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors, a law firm based in Blackburn, experienced a shameful moment before the Liverpool Crown Court, when he was found guilty after a three-week trial of defending the exercise of justice in two cases.
During the previous hearing, he admitted to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's fall came after Scarborough's police investigation found he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives watched the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him place drugs at a purity of 60 percent under the lawyer's basket in a black golf gloves.
Then Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium at Ewood Park, in a regular phone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two.
The court found traces of class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was “a regular user of cocaine.”
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, and said he spoke to a suspected dealer because he was his client, and argued that their conversation fell into “trustful communication”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards from it, but they were all arrested and his hair samples were taken.
In a police hearing, he said he was running an office at both his home and his workplace, and that the clients were visiting him at home for work.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of which he had previously represented to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: \"Who else is more aware that he must not violate the law than the lawyer in the criminal field -
Mr. Ditta is accused of misuse of his position as legal representative and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we are talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, but about a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were certainly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal client-client relationship.
The police were wasting as much as possible to enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring a good reputation for his profession, but, on the contrary, he dishonored it.
He came too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disturbed.
Ditta refused the offence and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer I wasn’t, and I would like to pass on information to Mr Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
After hearing, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself when he began to get drugs from organized criminals.
His dependence on cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of the organized crime groups, which gave him the task of collecting valuable information about the police investigation.
The legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and have confidence in the public and the feeling that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the mantle of his profession.
A serious and organised crime unit in Lancashire has conducted an investigation against Mr Ditto, on the basis of which he was also convicted for three cases of cocaine possession and now for preventing the exercise of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring criminals to court.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is out of the reach of the law.
We will find you and stand before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was declared guilty of association in order to deliver heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in the trade were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the block of death in America, as a guest for dinner, he would like Mohammed Ali and as a motivation for work he presented an inequality.
He negotiated with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal sent against Babish.
In the elections, the people received only a third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of YES.
However, they enter the negotiations on the government with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to guess the contours of a possible coalition, Jan Kasala - a man who matched the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrei Babiš have such a matadora on their side.
Perhaps this time it will be a reminder of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a whole new party.
“The experience was minimal at the time,” Kasal said.
Kenya's press outraged by the controversial media law
“It’s a scary report and it’s on the spot to ask what Parliament will prevent it from simply taking away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” the paper said.
“This law is strict and very repressive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said the new media tribunal \"will always be biased because it is an extended hand of the government - and that restrictions on content and advertising will harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs,” he said.
According to the Star Journal, the bill actually gives the government \"full control over the media\" and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya \"severe in a tough blow\" and criticizes the bill's proposal as \"strict\"
The adoption of the bill comes amidst a number of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack of an Islamic shooter in the Westgate Shopping Center.
The anger of the authorities turned to Kenya's media when it aired a security camera on which soldiers sent to the site of the attack reportedly looted the store of luxury goods.
The police director responded by calling two journalists and a leading media worker to the hearing, but the call was later withdrawn after the media pressure.
According to the new bill, media companies can be fined with up to 20 million Kenya shillings and individual journalists with up to one million, along with the risk of “decommissioning” or being denied official journalism accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is also one fine enough to liquidate most radio stations.”
It is also reported that these measures may have an winding-up effect on what is called the Kenyan “live blogosphere”
Politicians know that when they silence the media, they can do whatever they want to do with impunity.
“You never know what can happen,” journalist Nation Mutuma Mathia wrote, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“If we leave it on the politicians, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting,” he wrote.
In the past, lawmakers in Kenya have been criticised by the public.
In May, they voted to abolish cuts ordered by the National Salary Agency and restore their fat salaries to around 532,000 tax-free shillings per month, which ranks among the highest in the world.
They have to save themselves, they know young Czechs.
Most of them don’t even know what interest rates.
More and more Czechs are putting money aside.
However, they do not reach the champions in saving in the region.
Most of the money is deposited by Austrians, who will save an average of 181 euros per month.
The Czechs will also save people in Slovakia.
It follows from a survey by Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the organizers is improving and two-thirds of the respondents are planning to give themselves more money.
While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the rankings, in Romania and Serbia, people saving products still use very little.
For example, almost every other Serb will save at home - under a pillow - according to a survey.
This year, the number of people saving higher amounts per month has increased.
Last year, every month, 26% of respondents were put aside from thousands to 2.5 thousand crowns, and this year it is 5 percent more.
The average monthly storage in the year-on-year comparison, however, fell slightly to 2078 CZK.
The biggest hit between savings products is pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of construction savings is falling, compared to last year there has also been a significant decline in interest in investment funds.
Only 16% of respondents have already been involved, while last year it was almost a quarter of people.
The survey also found that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what yields on individual products they achieve.
Young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is interested.
On the contrary, the best awareness of the profitability of its deposited money has the oldest group of asked, among people over fifty, 73 percent of those surveyed know it.
In an international comparison, Erste Czechs lead the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44% of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12-percent distance.
UN celebrates new targets for combating poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work without delay on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Prior to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, launched overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “sustainable development goals” to replace MDGs, which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr Ki-moon said at the summit overnight that it is now time “to rise above national interests”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the general SDGs,” he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 Development Programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to pursue our vision of the SDGs that build on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns escalate due to conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machely, the Mosombical President of the Founder, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputa to call peace passwords on a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
For fear of the future of her country, she exchanged corporate clothing as a t-shirt decorated with the inscription \"we demand security - in Portuguese and joined the crowd at the Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, almost daily reports of conflicts between the government forces and the Renamo side came, some of the worst conflicts since the peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then the government of apartheid in South Africa as part of an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
Following the 1992 peace agreement, he became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that an open conflict will break out again in the country, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
At stake, the fast-growing economy is at stake, as the discovery of large-scale offshore oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest can bring companies such as the Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, the Italian Eni and the American Anadarko, investments worth more than $50 billion over the next few years.
The ruling party of Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.
Renamo claims that the government has caused recent conflicts by launching an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional site of the Renamo Party.
The violent assault of former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked Renamo’s base and attempted to kill Afons Dhlakam, the group’s leader, told the Financial Times spokesperson Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government has accused Renamo of running conflicts because it has attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebusa was concerned about instability.
Mr. Guebusa told AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakem had seen himself as a “cracker” who wanted to use “anything left of his power to try to prove that he could order his own decisions to the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
However, concerns increased when Mr. Mazanga’s words were quoted that the party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
A letter from the FT said he meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the deal.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness,” said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease the tension between these parties, inflated by a number of clashes this year.
It's a charade between two big personalities (Guebusa and Dhlakema), said a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, a party seeking electoral change, has already said it would boycott the municipal elections planned for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort by a corrupt movement to gain benefits and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo’s electoral share has decreased since 1992, while the newer Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), founded by former member of the Renamo Party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says Mr. Guebus, whose second term ends next year, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
“He doesn’t want a democratic system of more parties, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace, because he doesn’t want to release the presidential office,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the side of Renamo has, but has carried out disruptive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.
Most of the clashes occurred in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers away from the capital of Maputo, but where the city of Beira, the port on which mining companies rely, including Rio Tinto and Vale, are exporting coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga did not want to comment on whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
Unstability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is solely the government and the president, and that he should be the one who finds the solution to the problems,” he said.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
“No one cares either Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for the way of life,” says the author.
The stories of Thorus can show that “the thick force cannot be equal to the clever cunning - while the Arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths would be “too wild for school teaching, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene,” Crossley-Holland said.
“I think it’s great that myths and folk creation are already part of education,” he said.
I've been throwing this plan for 20 years.
He added that \"openly instructors - authors and teachers are in a fascinating story with \"street - a message for children as a \"offer\"
Crossley-Holland, who translated the Beowulf epics from England, who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Brewers, says: “You may have good intentions, but you will do better to keep them for yourself.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an adult writer writing for children is the need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end with a happyend, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly established.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
Brno Starry Plant Takes Visitors to Space in New Digital
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last half of a year.
There is a new stage, visitors can fall into new comfortable seats and over their heads there was a projection area of 17 meters in diameter in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the image perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the device is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
“There are twenty-one computers that generate the image,” said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno Starry Plant.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
“The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of classical personal computers,” said Tomáš Hladik.
The digitarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, human body or ocean bottom.
The viewers will thus appreciate themselves directly in the middle of the universe or the brain of man.
Other similar facilities are closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the stellar plant plans to project purchased shows and its own creation in the hall.
There are two shows on the show since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about the training of astronauts, fly into space, turn to centrifuge, and then see the challenging conditions of astronauts in space.
The second show is for children and has the name Magical Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose diverse-colored inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the eruption of a nearby volcano occurred.
The entire digitium cost about 50 million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the stellar plant from their budget also contributed with smaller amounts.
The design area cost ten million crowns, a projector of 12 million.
“The rest of them were audio-visual techniques and computers,” Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitization followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the stellar plant passed two years ago.
According to director Dušek, 25 to 30,000 visitors could still come by the end of the year.
We've been studying 11 thousand inserates!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 ads offering jobs, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 advertisements (62 percent) on the internet.
The Internet is therefore becoming the most important medium for posting job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, its share was 26%.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010) it stood at about 60 percent.
The publication of job opportunities in itself, according to the analysis, largely reflects the current situation in the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during the period of economic prosperity and during the economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 nearly 25,900 ads were published in the same period, less than half of them in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of the workers, said Pavlína Happyová, the author of the analysis.
The level of representation of selected professional groups varies from one media to another.
Advertisers looking for managers and managers, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts took the lead on the internet.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representations belong mainly to the service and labour professions.
The most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through advertising offers include, of course, education.
Other areas followed included foreign language knowledge, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for foreign language knowledge was presented in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet at 37 percent.
Only 2% of the ads required active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (in daily printing in 11 percent, on the internet at 57 percent).
The industry practice was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
The requirements for practice are linked to qualified professions.
It is mainly about production managers and other managers.
The workers’ professions include, in particular, mechanics and repairers, or the manufacturer and processor of food products or the repairer of electrical devices, the author of the study Jiří Tillner added.
Employers also report requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates in half of their ads.
As the most frequently requested skills, communication skills have appeared in the first place in advertising for a long time.
In addition, employers demand flexibility, adaptation and dynamics, independence, responsibility, organisational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be claimed that New York City is the place where a solo comic performance was born in America: almost a century ago, the variable artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chair of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell people jokes by the method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines solo comedy institution, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the point that they are too big to play at the club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes the performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual musically comedic performance at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform.
Just as this festival has spread, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Several comics from this year’s festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows in smaller radio or television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll went up with his sitcom (very spicy “League” on a fantastic-football topic on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both Saturday night live and “Parks and recreation”, but the most famous was the rapidly spreading series of videos “Markel the shell with shoes on”.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comics with clearly recognizable voices (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, tender, racially focused W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival’s biggest drivers will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comician, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called \"Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg\"
The meeting takes place in Town Hall, Manhattan.
“This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” he said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the aisle between two buildings and says to himself, \"Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.\"
Oil price goes down to $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to decline on Friday, as concerns about high stocks were balanced by a report showing the strengthening of the Chinese energy-lacing industry.
The U.S. oil indicator for December’s delivery fell to $96.24 per barrel in European e-commerce during the late morning on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the drop was 39 cents and in October it was 5.8%.
The wealth of oil stocks in the past few weeks has burdened the price.
The Energy Ministry said Wednesday that US stocks have increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese production came to a greater demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after a growth of 7.8% after the previous two weak decades in the third quarter.
Brent, an indicator for international oil used also by American refineries, fell on the London International Trade Exchange by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel.
No way, Mr. Haska.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
It is necessary to put such pressure on Martin Hašek to be deprived of all political functions and to leave the mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so elusive.
Martin Hašek makes a promise, but everyone and politicians must be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babiš also has the material one, but it is a question of whether it is a politician).
A self-determination program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He is not sorry in politics, he is moving away from politics.
Mr. Haška, if you mean it well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me, if you have not just lied - here you can see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone as a man.
People then accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a backless weakness, whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be proud, be a missing person or a lifetime sketch.
It may seem unfair to you when I speak only to you, but you are the leader and they are the wrong sheep.
And you are the leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that now you're trying to fold your ears for a moment, regroup your forces, sit down that shame and then attack again, but that's how the partisans or the subdued behave.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes a leader, an alpha male, so act like this.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The court has blocked regulations on the process of stopping and searching persons by police department in NY
The Federal Appeals Court blocked a court order demanding changes in the program of stopping and searching persons in the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Federal Court of Appeal said the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be postponed until a decision to appeal the city filed.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and asking people.
The city’s conclusions and its amending regulation came to mind, including the decision to allocate surveillance to the police department to help change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the required delay.
The appeal court said the judge had to be dismissed because she had been in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judges by not acting as a judge to avoid the appearance of the party, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements that she had openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they were wrongfully targeting blacks and Hispanics within their program of stopping and searching persons.
It established independent supervision to oversee major changes, including reform in procedures, training and surveillance, and ordered the launch of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in some areas where the most frequent stopping of persons occurs.
In August, New York City agreed to end the method of keeping names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The oral justification for the city’s appeal is scheduled sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have criticized a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, there has been stopping and searching people for about a decade, but recorded tours under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases they were blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to minorities, filed a lawsuit that became a case of a group action.
Proponents of changes to the program of stopping and searching of persons carried out by the police department in NY claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and efficiency of the police department, and may affect how these procedures are used by other police departments.
The opponents say the changes will reduce police morality, but not crime, and that money will be wasted, but it will not solve a wider problem when the police force is under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by several thousand people over the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching for persons who are constitutional, but reformed the way the police department conducted inspections in NY.
Five-fifths of shopping malls face low traffic
This is based on Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle real estate consulting companies.
In Prague Bohnice, the Business Centre of Krakow opens to the public, it will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
In the Czech Republic there are now 90 large shopping centers.
Unsatisfied performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are an inadequately large center for location and poor layouts, i.e. too much floor or complicated and opaque arrangement of passages, or dead places of centers,” said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
According to Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about one-fifth of the retail real estate department is facing low traffic.
The main reasons include poor transport accessibility, low income categories of local residents or oversaturity of the market in the given place.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mostly unsatisfying at first.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and dislike to change their shopping habits.
The new trading centers need to try to ‘truck’ their customers into new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events,” Samadi added.
According to Soták, the ownership of shopping centers is generally stable, even in some centers it rises, because the tenants were willing to discount from the rent and rent some units in the crisis.
“But it is true that recently some projects have been opened that are not fully occupied and reduce average cast (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc),” Soták added.
Trade centers opened in the past two years are very slow on the market, according to Sylvie Samadi.
However, there is a market place for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for building a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinence centers', aimed at shopping and day-to-day services for the population living in the immediate vicinity,\" Samadi said.
According to Soták, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centers.
Both for small 'service' centres, for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or for expansion in regional cities.
“Towns such as Kladno, Czeske Budejovice, Brno or Pilsen have space for further growth,” Soták added.
In Prague, he sees a space for a ready-made shopping centre at the Vítězné náměstí (Vítězné náměstí) and the clear potential of Na Příkopě street and Wenceslas Square.
“Intensive expansion of retail parks that allow traders to cover and expand into increasingly smaller cities at favorable rent and operating costs, space is also in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, or their reconstructions such as the reconstruction of the Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location,” added Dita Kubanková from DTZ.
In the Czech Republic, there are currently 90 modern shopping centers with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross leased areas.
A quarter of all these shopping malls are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic is lagging about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check out the tip
Former newspaper editor News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods of \"inflating into the phone, tracking and confrontation\" to confirm the fraudulent love relationship that former Interior Minister Charles Clarke was supposed to be involved in.
In May 2005, U.S. prosecutor Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had captured a false report that Clarke was seen with his “attractive Special Advisor” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper was commissioned by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail box and penetrate her privacy, but the court said that he had also called and left her voice messages.
“The State Representative suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the person standing in front of the house hoping to catch people outside, but the person who likes to tell people stories to see what they say,” Mr. Edis said.
He said that the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: hacking into the phone, tracking and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
She clearly knows about the other, the tracking, she needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about getting into the phone?
He says no, we say, \"But certainly he knows.\"
Families about the love relationship that Clarke is involved in were first captured by the NotW newspaper reporting department, when the source that sexually interested Mrs. Pawlby was said, “You’re just wasting time, she’s with Charles.”
The recording with voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as \"Projects\"
While Mrs. Pawlby was being investigated, her grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former rapporteurs Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup oversee the monitoring of Mrs. Pawlby's movement.
He left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, telling her: “I got a story we’re going to go to tomorrow and I’d like to talk to Charles about.”
Mr. Edis says that the involvement of Coulson in the story was the same model as other prominent personalities, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The court said on Thursday that he confronted Mr. Blunkett for a love relationship with the married woman, while he himself saw co-appointed Rebeka Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied associations with others to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to hacking into the phone.
NSA revelation increases state-based social paranoia surveillance
One peaceful day at the end of August, the German police helicopter was buzzing over the U.S. consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photos of the roof of the American pre-scheduled patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media said the BfV had hoped it would be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this action launched an exchange of views between the US and German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. National Intelligence Director, insisted in September that the U.S. did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies in favor of U.S. companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who became a co-worker, began to reveal his valuable collection from the secret surveillance of the United States, the European government, and leading entrepreneurs no longer know if they should believe the words of the director.
Following reports that the U.S. National Security Agency conducted espionage in a Brazilian oil company and gained access to the data with which U.S. cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have reached general paranoia about state surveillance of new dimensions.
The last drop came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been listened to for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can target, then they are certainly potential targets and leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies more transparent.
I would say that it is possible that this data is used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY consulting service, German companies believe that in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the U.S. is now as high a risk as China.
However, in the entire documentation revealed by Mr Snowden, there is no evidence yet that the United States has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and said it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical about this.
German Parliament says we should make a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again.
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn’t have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is done, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The extent and technical elaboration of U.S. spy agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking to some companies who have so far believed that China is China’s biggest surveillance threat.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing where European leaders have more widely realized that data stored in the US falls under that jurisdiction and is therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-Americans have cancelled plans to use a cloud provider based in the U.S. after the U.S. data mining program was revealed.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “We have a new question for customers who haven’t been here a year ago - where my data is stored and you can guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction.
Many German high officials argue that the latest reports are merely a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and that this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being done is not a surprise.
It always happened.
“This has been a crucial issue for many years and this has not changed significantly even during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of the agrochemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, as well as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to boast of the countermeasures they have done so as not to give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free memory USB drive or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unwise.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the board meeting so that they can’t be used as listening devices.
The German BfV office advises executives to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign roads because of the risk that smartphones can be distrusted.
Your mobile phones will then be thrown out.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are leaders of the global market in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access,” BfV said in a statement.
The U.S. warns its own company of economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, National Intelligence Estimate reported in February next to Russia and Israel in the second series of perpetrators involved in the hacking activity for economic reporters, just behind China.
A board member in a German risk-free company concluded that in terms of economic espionage, \"the French are the worst -
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal news agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, although working together to fight terrorism, are spying on their allies.
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered.
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside the creamy fighting spirit in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found down in a spiritually leveled tribune at a high school gym where he went.
The Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died by accident, but the family of a seventeen-year-old youth refused.
“They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for FoxNews, told FoxNews.com, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed that he died as the Sheriff said.
“They are convinced that this contradicts logic, physical laws and common sense,” Crump said.
They believe that this should put out what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
“As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned to the dead in a bag,” he said.
Secretary of State Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting Johnson's death investigation, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep an eye on the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I am of the opinion that there is enough basis for a normal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the original pituits indicated that Johnson had died as a result of “position suffocation.”
According to Moore, however, the second drink reported another cause of death.
“There are a few questions that must be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if, in Johnson’s death case, he reveals enough evidence to order criminal investigations or civil rights violations, he asks the FBI and its execution.
A representative of the Sheriff's Office from Lowndes County was not immediately available on Thursday for any comments.
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to make available all the videos from the surveillance cameras that the investigators had viewed.
The parents of the youth hope that the videos will contain a trace leading to the discovery of how their son died.
CDC Center Releases Allergy Guidelines for Schools in Children
The Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) has issued a set of guidelines to help children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of directives issued by the U.S. government because the number of children of school age suffering from food allergies is rising.
One in 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to notify the teachers and staff about child food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
Also, schools are advised to have adrenaline - the EpiPen automatic injector is most often used - to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
Recently, state lawmakers have updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, “It’s like someone is hitting my tongue, ‘I feel like I’ve got hair on my tongue,’ or ‘I’ve got a tongue’.
Parents of intersex children can choose “uncertain sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize the third sex in children born with ambiguous sex.
Newborn children will no longer be referred to either male or female.
The new law does not require any gender to be given to such children and allows them to indicate gender as “uncertain” or “unspecific” on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to decide on the operation of their child to determine the sex, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years: “I’m neither a man nor a woman,”
I'm going to stay slatted by a doctor-created, stunned and scarred.
It is estimated that every year from 2,000 children are born one that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, a roofing term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed genitals.
She could have been intersexual, Wallis Simpson.
The determination of gender is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when you cannot determine gender, it is better to use the best available information and determine it instead of waiting and monitoring the child’s psychological and physical development until surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determining issues, said the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersexual children are ethical dilemmas.
“Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but this is not the case for most children,” he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery, and then it can wait for the identity to evolve.
Knowledge of how sexuality develops in a child is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It’s like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transgender or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but biological construction that is neither male nor female, but typically composed of both, and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These traits can manifest in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transgender people in the field of work, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not correspond to any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to mark male, female or “third sex” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian woman, became the world’s first known “sexless” person in June when she won a court appeal to keep her “indeterminate” sex status for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports except M (male) and F (women) will have a third designation, X, for intersex persons.
In neighbouring France, the 24 issue of gender is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “sex theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic online website has also defined itself against the German law and wrote: “With the way the world is drawn to a new state, when gender is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we are turning over two more pillars of civilization.”
One mother from Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would rather see to give her children sex at birth.
“The parenting itself is stressful without any other restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your child,” she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodite, according to the handsome Greek who had a double sex.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that gender was something like a table that could be deleted and redrawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, with the fact that sexuality is a complex matter, and doctors may sometimes decide incorrectly because they do not know how they will feel about their sexes when they grow up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
The persistent theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender is subjective.
He created a new concept of \"sexuality\" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment - as parents raised their child - were affecting the child's genes and hormones and shaping the child, regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theory became questionable.
Parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to poorly performed circumcision recommended that their child be completely castrated, removed and raised as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When he was 15 years old, he got back to the boy and married a woman.
At age 38 he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared \"dissatisfied with the result -
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes, but ambiguity of sex.
Doctors were not sure if he had a big throat or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfying life.”
And so, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed by the external organs and varlats and was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18 he was sent to a vagina plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After birth, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD) that prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its genital system.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took doses of testosterone and had his breasts removed,
Operations caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perceptions of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the law group Advocates for informed choice, who is based in California, fears that the German law “calls for sneezing and stigmats.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will achieve the encouragement of parents to make quick decisions and choose ‘indeterminate’ for the child,” she said.
We are afraid that this will encourage intervention.
We think it's better to allocate male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will end up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legally valid sex,” she said.
The German law is going to allocate it at birth.
This is a battle that a young child should not be deceived at this moment.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sex disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law “will give powers to both parents and children.”
Daughter Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called insensitivity syndrome on androgens.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, Katie's female traits have developed.
He has a vagina, but he has no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, 29-year-old Katie is married and, as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania, she works as an intern in child psychology.
Although infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or substitute motherhood.
“The law will give parents some space not to rush with their decision,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and think about it, and it gives them time to write “man” or “woman”
In this regard, everything is fine - you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful child and you are happy about it.
You don't have to rush with an operation that's irreversible.
“It brings the opportunity to engage in decision-making and the child and removes the anxiety that parents bind because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child decides with which sex he identifies more - and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
Drunked the whole house with gasoline: He threatened to burn it with his own family!
Tensions increased, fear escalated.
The man began to threaten to burn the whole house.
All available police patrols in the area, as well as the Mladá Boleslavi firefighters and the volunteer firefighters.
There was also a police negotiator who tried to excuse his irrational behavior.
The man was still threatened to burn the house.
So she had to enter the house of an intervention unit that destroyed the man and tied him up.
The aggressor then finished his examination at a youthful hospital, where he was taken to an anti-alcoholic detention station.
The firefighters eventually filled the house with gasoline with sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition, all pets were rescued from the house.
The man did not give up on the police negotiator, so he was followed by a cop.
Obama’s campaign to exchange Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest adviser, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton as a 2012 candidate.
This revelation is the most important sensation of the eagerly anticipated 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann \"Double Down: Game Change 2012\"
The Times magazine received a copy of the upcoming book and announced Thursday night that the president’s senior co-workers had held intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to estimate whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama’s pale hope of re-election.
According to a national political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of the leaders inside the campaign and in the White House, namely former White House head Bill Daley, to measure the effect on the election should move former Secretary of State Clinton to the post of Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisers, including Daley, Obama's former campaign chief Jim Messina and former top advisers at the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouff, knew that this change was being considered.
Double Down claims that Daley was a representative of Biden’s efforts to replace him, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to carry out this move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would “not significantly increase Obama’s chances”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I have studied a number of things intensively and this was one of them,” Dalea said.
You must not forget that at that time the president had terrible prospects, so we said to ourselves, “Christepan, what should we do?”
While Daley described research as “relevant care,” Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had made a small investment to see if the move would pay off.
“At the campaign, there is no such money for elections and qualitative research if something is not really considered,” Martin said at AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about this potential card mix.
While Daley said he didn’t think the president was aware of the potential change, the former head of the office admitted that it was “possibly” Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book “Double Down” does not definitely answer the question of whether a political probe has reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on the removal of Biden from the candidate.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British entrepreneur made the first ice cream that shines in the dark - using a honeyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a glowing skylight.
He came up with the idea when he read the expert treatise on the Medusa, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically produce protein that causes light-emitting.
This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer - it increases the pH level in protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says that ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and therefore the more you lie, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company \"Lick me I'm delicious\" says: \"It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we're in the beginning, so for £200 you get about 2 g of this substance -
The protein we use in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up protein, pH increases, and ice cream begins to shine.
We tested it over the past few months and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the mezzo-lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
Every hill costs me £140.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold.
But its next product should be even more ambitious.
He says, “I really want to make invisible ice cream.”
In essence, this is impossible because of the breakage of the light caused by the ice crystal that makes up the ice cream, but I am counting on some way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the honeyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
We could eat sweets with our sister, stay awake for a long time and show off with our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a logger.
For two years, no candy appeared in my apartment, and this year probably won't be different.
However, statistics show that I am, in terms of Halloween, a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans will celebrate Halloween this year - in fact 158 million of them - and spend a total of $6.9 billion for sweets, costumes and ornaments.
But what I always look forward to about Halloween is trends.
According to the NRF, it is expected that from $6.9 billion spent, 1.2 billion will go to costumes.
This year they are the last shot of the fashion of sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy no longer only need to be women; sexy can also be meals like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect that thanks to the parade of the dead we will see a lot of zombies, and I bet that the space men from Daft Punk will reach our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witch.
I guess there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my surprise we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, it will spend $330 million this year on costumes for animal pets.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
This is about 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds sweets and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is an amazing news for 41 million collegemen who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to break our quarter.
In fact, during Halloween we buy, and believe not and we consume 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want is corn bonbons, and yet nearly 16,000 tons will be sold around Halloween according to the National Diabetes Association.
That's about 9 billion individual corn bonbons.
That's a secret I've never dissolved.
Nothing is more typical than scary houses for Halloween.
They have the best names, such as \"Terror behind the walls\" and \"Howl-O-Scream\" and \"The House of Shock.\"
In fact, in the United States, there are officially dedicated 1200 scary houses that, according to the company of American Horrifying Houses, have a profit of $500 million, and this includes the amazing photos where you are stunned by fears and which your friend will put on Facebook, and you can’t remove them and the person you like will look at the photo and credit the comment as “beautifully face-to-face.”
Finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us a great pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and carving a pumpkin chandelier is something like decorating a Christmas tree - we've been doing it since we were a kid.
Fortunately for us, the trend of “the baby in the pumpkin” started last year with the Pinterest app, so most of us grew up in the fact that we carved the stick instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Office, Americans spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
A pumpkin lucern with a flashy flame on your front veranda probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try cutting their pumpkins weighing almost one tonne.
The Land Rover Series
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as intercommunication equipment.
There are improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and storage of the vehicle between races.
Drew Bowler, Technical Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The race participants coming to Bowler have changed.
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure, as well as an achievable road to world class races.
We are pleased to be able to offer them this journey in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that they will prepare competitors for the hardness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge - it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have early elections in two years
The President of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election to take place soon.
A week after the last one in the interview for Aktunalne.cz said that a different starting point is not and every government came out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blindman.
“It can’t last long,” said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that the lifespan of the beginning election period is estimated within two years.
With the objection that next time voters hardly choose a completely different choice, they disagree: ‘I think it will be a bit more balanced decision-making’
At the same time, the President of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose its voters this year in the next elections (compared to 300,000 votes in 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it was clear within two months that the early elections would be, it would strengthen the 2011 ANO movement by Andrei Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babis will lose.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where the chairman of Bohuslav Sobotka, following a secret meeting of a part of the party’s leadership, declared that he or Michal Hašek will remain in the leadership of social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg after his own:
“The leaders of the Democratic Party as the little boys go behind the head of the state to allow them a coup in the party,” he said.
“I thought Mr. Hašek was smarter and smarter.
“Because I haven’t seen anything so unwittingly stupidly done in my life,” he added.
And in the direction of President Zeman (who he met in the fight for presidential office) he stunned: ‘The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take over the party’
The first law has already been passed on to TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?
TOP 09 has already formally presented its first draft laws in the House, including the Farian Register of Treaties, which had been discussed by the House Committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
President of TOP 09 in an interview with Aktunalne.cz claims that such speed is given by ‘these laws are needed’.
At the same time, however, the TOP 09 clearly wants to make similar attempts from other parties.
For example, election leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in a pre-election struggle that the idea of introducing a register of treaties was \"stealing\" the agenda of the YES movement.
TOP 09 has now taken the lead - it just dusted the proposal, which had already progressed into the second House of Commons reading.
Firefighters came to save a lost puppy who stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous outburst in stonenol
Ruby ran away after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was imprisoned in a stonestone by a man walking a dog.
Firefighters were silhouetted on a rock wall to save the dog from a certain death.
The puppy was liberated by fire units who came to deliver him after somehow he was trapped in a dangerous outage in a stonestone 15 meters above the ground.
Ruby fled after a small car crash on Sunday afternoon, and lived three days alone until he was released from the stove on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson (25), and their girlfriend Becky Hall (20), were in the Flappit Stonestone in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
After he ran away when he got into a small accident, they searched for their lost dog and put challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, around 14.15, a sharp-sighted guy named Ruby saw an outburst in stonenol 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station hastened to free Ruby, using a animal transport bag to pick him up on the rock.
technical rescue team chief Andy Clayton said the dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was directly in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and bottom.
He didn't move his beard in the rescue room - he was completely frozen.
He's okay now.
Then he got the cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is incredible.
Technical Rescue Team Chief Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape.
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a tour, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was afraid when I looked at the rescue action.
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall.
Firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very courageous.
We are very grateful to them, they were all just huge.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: \"We were afraid he could fall, but he stayed there -
Firefighters were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after 18-year-old Katy Perry did not leave.
During an interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that for Jagger’s song “Old Habits die hard”, she sang backing vocals from 2004.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
She said, “It was a long time ago, and now it’s very nice to me.”
In a statement from Jagger's Thursday (70), a representative said he categorically refused to make Katy Perry's proposals.
The representative said, “You may confuse him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album, “Prism,” debuted first this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe Gives Scots a Choice
The next day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that the condition for the membership of independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This led to stories of passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this was not reflected in the headlines of the newspaper.
No one has mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they do.
Since Scotland is not currently in Schengen, the offer of continued non-compliance would be a cheap concessions for Brussels for whatever they really want from the Scottishs.
So it's a pretty weak story.
In addition, so old that it became a excavation, a journalist's duck, that \"independence means passport control - I heard at least 40 years ago.
Still, there is one interesting idea in this bearded storytelling.
Why should independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why exchange the London Chomout for the Brussels, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally collapsed.
The impact of the euro crisis is the so-called project Europe officially dead.
Throughout Europe, the parties to the commitment to the EU or to the abolition of the euro as a common currency are affected.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany, founded this year, came as if from nowhere, and already in the September federal elections, it took up nearly five million votes, thus essentially “extinguishing Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
At home, there was always resistance to a plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The cost-effectiveness dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the fiduciary kajkat drawn on the national economy through the gluing on the common currency, has led many people to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little in common with the fact that the national governments are managing a high budget deficit - this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is the euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates beneficial to German exporters - and German politicians want to keep it.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production versus Germany.
The only help is to cut off income and public spending, which is what is encouraged by Germany.
Behind the current problems with the budget and currency is the deeper cause of European small performance.
As a result of the \"green energy policy supported by Brussels - the code to support French and German consumer-cost companies - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gasoline than it is in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the cost area, as we have seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the world’s salary freezes would not turn the European petrochemical industry into cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a suffocating rebellion, especially in France, once an enthusiastic EU supporter.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool to keep Germany in check and allow Paris to stand up in the world at Washington level.
However, as a proof of political legitimacy, Berlin no longer needs and has left its own economic policy in Europe and the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: The right wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won major additional elections and has taken the ruling socialists to third place.
The front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes - an early warning to British Labourers that they cannot conclude that the split of the right will automatically manifest itself positively on the left.
How does Le Pen deal with her newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
The European elections next year would like to use it to create an anti-European bloc against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc can dominate the history of the European Parliament for the first time.
I think that in the near future the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will come together and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU will not disappear, but it will turn into something freer in the sense of \"Europe of the sovereign peoples\" - has already been preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will renew their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and move towards the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left to Atlantic cold.
Where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be areas (in principle) of Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - this includes the possibility to announce to Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I believe that Scotland would do well in a relaxed European order, provided it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and keep our economic independence.
The government of the SNP in Scotland is the most successful political movement not promoting austerity measures in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition attitude towards cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of conservatives and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence only to take austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Mature previously
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
It is not proven that there are hormones or other chemicals behind it.
Experts say that one of the triggers of earlier puberty can be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so evident in boys.
Former CNN rapporteur Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should a mother be appalled when her daughter begins to grow breasts and hair on shame at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time making sure my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, hair on the tail and underarms and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
In the last forty years, however, there has been only a small shift at the age when the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, it is now an average age of 12.5 years from the age of 12.75 years in 1970.
\"When the breasts begin to develop, at least two to three years will pass before the first menstruation occurs,\" said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of \"Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem\"
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
What activates the real beginning of puberty is discussed, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered “prematurely advanced”
In most cases, the process slows down or stops - which can be closely monitored by children's doctors.
Faster growth can be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to avoid serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of bones, which can eventually lead to the cessation of growth and fragility in adulthood.
Recommendations on drugs and hormonal treatments depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
As for drug deployment, Kaplowitz is careful, but acknowledges that “the suppression of puberty can alleviate the problems of the girl’s behavior and her feelings that it differs from her peers.”
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are worried that he can become pregnant or how he can handle hygiene,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” said one woman, whose daughter began to have menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
He came home scared and angry that he was the first of his friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is yet no consistent set of evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual message in the media.
Boys, like girls, get puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 that combines body fat with puberty timing.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
Explanations are different.
From a global perspective, patterns of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although hair appears in the face at a low age, the trend towards the full flowering of early puberty is not as obvious as it is in girls.
Other doctors participating in the American Children's Doctors Association (AAP) conference have added additional complexity to this topic.
Acne and hair loss are common even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their child’s doctor on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean having to talk to a child before you think,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will likely react well.
Girls who develop earlier need to be assured that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Mr. Konvalinková in the role of the economy.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Naďa Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the hook in the role of an economist and she was very successful.
Is the favorite Czech actress planning to change the profession and put on a business in the pub?
Nadia Konvalinková appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and made a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and I did it right away.
Even the boss offered me to hire me and I could feed myself by turning my beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stay with what I do today, at the acting,” she said with a smile, Konvalinková, who was a guest on the twentieth anniversary of the Irish pub.
“I like Irish beer and I’ll have Irish whiskey there,” the actress said.
Nadi, a longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nowy, also appeared at the event.
I'm dead and I can't drink in my new life.
“I have one beer or one drink a day, and I try to keep it,” the actor added.
Aircraft manufacturers argue for the width of the seats, at stake there are large orders
A second-class dispute with long-distance flight seats has been sparked among the aircraft manufacturers, which this month has led to a bitter exchange of views on Dubai’s air show.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided on long-haul flights for the economic class - not the one normally preceded by airlines, but whose assigned space is the key to efficiency requirements for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus has called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economy class this week, but major US rival Boeing says airlines should decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers competed in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-distance aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear of the aircraft is distributed, especially whether it is 9 or 10 seats side by side, is the basis for economic performance requirements for the design of new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the improved 777X will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread out of 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm of broad economic seats spread out after 9.
Huge aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus is now ahead of Dubai’s air show, where it is expected that 777X will get an advantage with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what could be the start of a new ad war when he showed financiers a picture depicting three people stuck in a restaurant with the title “You Would Like It”
“Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Head of Sales at Airbus.
As the eating habits change, people are bigger, but the seats on the aircraft have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, by the turn of the century, the U.S. Department of Health’s average American weight increased by 10 percent between the ages of 40 and 49.
According to American medical statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a passport of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that his rival adheres to the concept of 50s seats, when the average width of the newly baptized aircraft seats was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted a research that suggests that the seat expansion by 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Airbus rejects the Boeing dimensions of its seats and says it is not competent for aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that an experience in the cabin depends on more things than just the width of the seat.
“In fact, it’s about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do things they believe they need to do to be successful,” said Kent Craver, an expert in cabin space.
They don’t want us to dictate what profit brings them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is an essential larger space for elbows, but for suppliers, this is a growing problem that can affect yields.
Behind this dispute is a plant in aircraft orders with an estimated trade in the next decades worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices, enough to dissipate the weights of American and European exports.
As Reuters said in July, the layout of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 percent better efficiency than market leader Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
Boeing’s performance requirements depend in part on comparison of the 777X design with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
“The reason Boeing does this is to rush more seats, and make its aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say 10-seat cabins for existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“Fifty-five centimeters of a wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view, Airbus’ design is motivated by the threat of the 777 model,” said interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
Successful aircraft vendors even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive layout.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn’t been sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin adjustments by offering larger seats in the aisles for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call to new industrial standards will remain unanswered, but it can discourage sales of 777X.
The number of HIV infected people exceeded 1,000 in Prague.
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people increases every year.
For example, in 2002, the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121, and 180 in 2010.
There were 212 infected last year and it was a record number.
“The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200 is no longer doubt,” said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
He said there were 165 HIV patients in the country from January to September, with 176 in the same period this year.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of this September, HIV tests have been confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In Central Bohemia, 206 people were infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian Region or 116 from the Ústice region.
The least infected came from Vysočina, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88% of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with a blood transfusion in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, that is, in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV and transferred from their mother.
Nesenses in the movie Gravity are, but the watch is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic movie from the universe of Gravity sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic for some time after the premiere.
According to the Union of Film Distributors, almost 150,000 viewers saw it in October, earning over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the image positively.
Others, however, find some irregularities in it.
Server Lidovka.cz asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of stellar and planetarium Brno): I like scientific-fantastic films that I consider modern, dream fairy tales.
The movie Gravity does not exclude, even if it looks like -physically real - a performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it a lot.
You can see, for example, the hair of Sandra Bullock, which is not somehow lifted in a state of weightlessness.
Hubb's space telescope and International Space Stations are moving along significantly different orbits, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film blame for the unrealizing effect and the whole behavior of the fire in a state of difficulty.
The suits would also not be able to withstand such wounds.
Heroes in the movie Gravity often get into a collision with various objects and suits without any major difficulties.
Criticism was not even saved by the plot.
Thus, the widespread tragedy in the Earth's orbit is unrealistic, according to some of the debaters.
In addition, it wonders why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People also argue about ‘nereal’ behavior in the forums.
It seems to be intended for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of stellar and planetarium m. m. Prague): I have seen him only on a wide screen, but I can clearly say, I was charmed.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to adhere consistently to reality.
“More than the irregularities you mentioned, I was touched by the three times the space station with degrading levels of technology (last Chinese)”
“China will remain until the end of the decade, and it will probably look better than it is in the film.”
Vladimír Karas (director of the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are trying very successfully to not violate physical laws, and so a naturally-oriented viewer will appreciate that during various cosmic collisions and collisions quite correctly preserves the moment of momentum, which is said by the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic, including the thin skins of the atmosphere and the polar rays coming near the polar areas.
Incomparability will certainly be found during a more detailed examination.
For example, when I read comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various cosmic garbage on orbit appears in some scenes than it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (a worker of the Astronomy Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted by the creators to their needs, but no fundamental and in the sky calling for a sin against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of a similar focus, it is seen that the creators have made a difference in the credibility of the events shown.
From moments that make no sense to name the fact that Hubble's space telescope orbits a otherwise inclined orbit than ISS.
As a result, there is a very different speed and the rescue operation could not actually take place as shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of the Kowalsky (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) department, I noticed that the entire ISS would rotate, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, who forces both actors to move on when they no longer move towards each other.
A new nicotine vaccine can take away smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before the human trials, it is necessary to carry out additional tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says that the first signs are good.
“We firmly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their addiction to nicotine is so strong to overcome all current approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been compiled to carry genetic information to create anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to create a smooth current of these antibodies.
Antibodies persecute all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, thus preventing the smoker from getting nicotine intervention.
In the tests of vaccinated mice to which nicotine was additionally supplied, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that were not vaccinated, “relaxed,” said the researchers, a sign that nicotine got into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given as often as possible to maintain adequate antibody levels, so they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of the new vaccine should be much lower, as it converts liver cells into antibody production factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette and avoid nicotine addiction.
However, it would be much more likely to be used by smokers to stop.
“They will know that once they start smoking again, there will be no pleasure in the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but note that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies that it would be influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by a state committee on corruption surveillance.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied changing the policy of a coastal lease at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on a government-controlled plot.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday expanded its search for whether Mr. Obeid had lobbyed several state ministers to hire him at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without having to take part after his expiry in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew about Mr Obeid's classified interests in these properties, based on the evidence presented on Thursday by Mr Tripodi's former deputy head of office, Lynn Ashpole.
During the years of interviews launched in 2005, the government pushed for the leases to be held in public competitions.
The tenants were opposed to this and also wanted more long-term contractual conditions.
In 2009, leases for companies in Circle Quay, which brought Obeid $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public competitions.
However, he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, urged a shift in government rental policy.
The call transcript presented at ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, the chief official who came to the port department after working under Mr. Obeid in the fishing department.
“He was the subject of interviews during these telephone calls to develop the policy of commercial rentals,” said co-commissioning Commissioner Anthony Whealy, Mr Tripodi.
“No,” said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military planes attack target in Syria, said responsible official
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, the responsible administration of Fox News confirmed.
This responsible official did not specifically say what purpose it was, but he said he was at least one.
The Associated Press said the targets were the SA-125 missiles of Russian production.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel launched an air strike on the delivery of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it’s different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, while the chairman of Štěch did not wave.
Hehtman Hovanec was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the poverty of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, Vice-President Zaorálek has been prevented from talking most on television.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better option than the ČSSD proposed by the Vice-President of Senate Gajdůšková as Prime Minister, the only one would have no initial disability and I think she would have done the standard performance.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone in the management will support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what has been done and continue without tearing the party.
Alena Gajdůšková could without fear set up a minority government with only a blessing from the chairman of Babiš and without the peoples, but with the folk health minister, the spokesperson, who is actually a believer of the Social Democrats.
This minority government would have great stability, as it would have enforced a proper referendum law, and it is committed to supporting the President of the Okamura Dawn.
President Babiš would eventually reconcile with the progress of taxes, for he is smart and will see that it is not possible without her.
The people would not bring problems, because the spokesperson is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not otherwise be in the government.
The same is true of YES, even here a valuable minister would be found, but when they rationally do not want to enter into a risky government participation, they will provide support, also well.
Let us add courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
Foreign workers with a visa permit may be subjected to a “legislative” test.
As the government intends to expand police interventions, it is considering the “legitimateness test” for foreign workers with a visa license of 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through criteria to prevent 457 from being used to meet unqualified jobs, or as a backdoor to move family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was released today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned government rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australian neighbors.
“The loud statements of ‘foreigners at the end of the front’ and ‘work first for Australians’ are a very unpleasant remnant from the time the unions demanded a protected labour market,” the Institute said.
Historically, this meant that the white labour force was to be protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if anyone in this region had heard the echo of this historical artifact.
The article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration minister Brandon O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he was dealing with officials for human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, and others are left to consider.
If the eligibility criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘nomination is justified in the event that the candidate is in a relationship or in a personal relationship with the owner or the relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking’.
After previous experience with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of employees, but then employed hundreds of them, companies may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan man who sought asylum died suspected of a heart attack after he arrived on an asylum ship on Christmas Island this week.
A man's nine-year-old scared son traveled to Australia with him and, after his father's death on Wednesday, was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities rushed to a hospital in Christmas Island where he died.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will start as soon as the first phase starts in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project \"connects Britain together\"
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was working with the British government on this plan \"excited.\"
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After the completion of the phase two will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and North England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which held talks with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to identify further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that connects Britain and its cities better.
We gave SH2 green, because the benefit it will bring is huge.
Without this, we face a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also a link between the UK and 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected with the HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.
Under the Scottish government, Keith Brown, Mr. Carmichael, called for “uniquely” support for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed track has the potential to bring Scotland an immeasurable economic advantage, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain.”
We are therefore excited to work with the British government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed railways to Scotland and thus bring benefits to everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government is planning to do so.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the British ministers next year and making joint decisions on the next steps.
Bárta arrests surveillance and anti-corruption police analysts
Information about the arrest of Vit Barta began to spread on Thursday night, when the message brought the server Firstpravy.cz.
MF TODAY soon found out that she took charge of the General Inspection of Security Corps (GIBS), her people should have been arrested in the center of Prague.
It happened in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection addresses cases where police officers are among the accused, but its jurisdiction also applies to civilians.
According to the MF TODAYS, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police is among the arrested - the head of analysts and informatics Jan Petržílek.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
A spokesman for the anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej, refused to comment on the information saying the media had to turn to GIBS.
Even her spokesperson, Radka Sandorová, did not want to say anything about the case, referring to the Municipal State Council in Prague.
“We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts,” said Štěpánka Zenklová.
It can also be derived from this non-specific reaction that the event has taken place, but it is in a mode of secrecy that does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer Oldřich Chudoba is also in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Barta in this matter, but because it was classified information, he could not confirm or refute Barta's arrest.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police President Petr Lessy.
This was promoted by Bárta together with former VV Chairman Radek John, who was head of the Interior Ministry.
The dispute, which caused it to escalate between Prime Minister Petr Nečas and VV, had even to be resolved by then President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where that connection came from.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
“I really don’t know anything about things,” said IDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of the police.
He was officially promoted by Radek John, the real head of the party, but he was Bárta at the time.
Bárta now ran for the election for the Dawn movement, but only escaped from the parliamentary mandate by 175 votes.
The leader of Dawn Tomio Okamura said he didn’t know what was going on.
“Vit Barta was one of many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I have repeatedly said before the election, he was neither a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura,” he distanced himself from Barta Okamura, who said before the elections that he had given Barta the space to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of executioners.
Vit Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former VV co-worker Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules on the use of electronic equipment on aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airlines will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones while starting and landing, regardless of changes in the US to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies space to change their practices, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos, or play games during critical phases of flight if they stay in a “aircraft-mode.”
Passengers can already do this during a large part of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they cannot access their electronic books during the start and landing.
Australian carriers are investigating this decision, which requires U.S. carriers to do a lot of work to meet the requirements, but suggest that they do not plan to change their procedures soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined this announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
“The CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft,” he said.
This question is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they obtain from crew members.
Virgin, who has already talked to CASA about extending the use of its Wi-Fi on-board entertainment system, has been inclined to change, but has announced that it will be subject to the regulatory authority’s decision.
“We would welcome the CASA to conduct an analysis of the consent to use electronic devices, because we really think it would now, when we have (wired onboard entertainment), improve customer experience,” the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with the current regulations for the time being.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change that in the near future,” he said.
FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area that can be useful to our passengers, and we are sure to carefully examine the FAA decisions and the reasons behind it.
In the case of U.S. air carriers, the impact of regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their air park.
Carriers will need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
“As soon as the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones, at any altitude,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew orders passengers to shut down during the landing of the equipment.
The group also recommended that a heavier device be safely stored under the seat or in a storage area above the head during take-off and descent.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, buildings in Singapore are flourishing.
At the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore, Jani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter a school fee.
“We just bought a house with our husband, and I gave all my money for it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although every month as an administrator, she receives $2400 (3,000 SGD) and her husband also works, family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Demand across areas in Southeast Asia - where household debt is increasing - is indeed such that the company ValueMax, where a woman performs her transaction, has become a third stopover on Singapore's ranking this week.
Stopping jewelry is not just a quick way to borrow cash - 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga - but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Stations in Singapore commonly apply an annual percentage rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center.
Stoppages, however, have the advantage of not requiring verification of a person (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
Therefore, as families feel pressured because of the increasing cost of living and the increasing debt of households and consumer debt, millions of people across the region turn to stations.
After five years of massive growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a relaxed monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to stops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the Standard & Poor’s credit rating agency cited the increasing use of credit in households, mainly due to increasing rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia due to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of 80 percent of GDP, an increase from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists also feared a high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week just got out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The important thing is that with increasing costs, people from medium to low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Won, an economist at the Malaysian CIMB bank.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people are cunningly stopping their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city buildings are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's golden necklace and we get it back next month.
The largest plant operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its plant in recent months.
Growth in the construction industry is so big that ValueMax, a branch operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four branches - but also outside Asia, says CEO ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will fund this by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it won on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount creditors have been under fire for high interest, Mrs. Yeah says that the flag offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase the debt.
“Customers stop objects they already own, and monetizing personal property doesn’t increase household debt,” he says.
In the company, the ownership of assets is increasingly being accepted as a means to ensure short-term, secured financing.
Among those who use the stopshops, in addition, they are not only people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax offices when they stop the Rolex gold bars or watches, and they can reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all possible circumstances.
“Wealthy individuals need to borrow for a short period of time due to their bold trades or investments, or small businesses that need help solving problems in their cash flow,” said Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
A $325 million bailout package for Kurdistan healthcare
The federal government insists on a $325 million bailout package for the Tasmania-based health care industry to include tough conditions to ensure that the government does not waste funds.
Federal Minister of Health, Tina Plibersek, said the Australian Union was “accelerated” to reverse the crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The funding for four years was decided after a government consultation with independent Kurdistan MP Andrew Wilk.
“The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that, as we believe, will solve the specific problems facing the state,” said Plibersek.
The $325 million package includes $31 million at the patient’s request.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and cataract surgery, will help to remove the debt.
The money is also available at free-access clinics in the Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training health specialists, mental health services and putting personal electronic systems of medical records in local hospitals.
“These investments are responding to the ideas that leading clinical doctors have told me that they will help the Kurdistan health system in the best way,” said Mrs Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Kurdistan government must require a strict reporting regime and registration obligations.
The state will need to maintain the current level of funding to receive the money of the Australian Union, and to inform each month where additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will not be useless, \"until a real reform follows in order to lay the more sustainable foundation of the Kurdistan public health system.\"
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for accelerated assistance, which he first raised in negotiations with the Prime Minister in early May.
“I believe that the federal aid package can get the state public health services out of critical condition,” Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the government, these additional procedures selected will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Federal Health opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's statement is just \"a patch.\"
“The reason I’m here is that the Labour government has removed $430 million from our health system,” he told ABC TV.
You can't have a government that's going to take away almost half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that's donating $300 million, and pretending to be good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no single dollar from the rescue package would be spent on a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted the novel Denise Dideroto, which brings an exceptional film journey and the portrayal of the time, but is also more boring than it should be.
It dates back to the 1960s in France, and tells a gloomy story about Susanne, a young noble man who is sent to the monastery by his family.
When it rebels, it experiences extremely cruel treatment from a penultimately depraved mother introduced and for another it becomes an object of sexual passion.
The film never slips to the fluency or sensibility, and that’s his problem.
The ritual character of this story leads to the fact that even the viewers will experience a torture similar to wearing a linen shirt.

Syria destroys chemical weapons, says supervisory authority
Syria destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poisonous gas ammunition, the global surveillance of chemical weapons committee said Thursday, while violent conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where poisonous substances are stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was announced on November 1st.
The term set by the Hague-based organisation to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons and machinery for mixing chemicals in order to create poisonous gas and munitions.
The completion of this, in principle, of the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, must begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies.
It is believed that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including yperite and neural gas sarin.
The announcement came as the fighting in Safira, which experts refer to as the headquarters of a chemical weapons and storage factory, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain.
A group of activists, who monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
There are 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government has 29,954 members of Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
There will also be 2,202 government overruns and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's troops fought in Safira against the rebels, many of whom are associated with Al Qaeda for weeks.
The observer said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
The fights have underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, in their mission, in the midst of the ongoing civil war, are to get rid of the chemical arsenal, must deal with tight deadlines.
In a statement from the OPCW Office, which works closely with the UN, it was said that his team is now “satisfied that he has verified and monitored the destruction of Syria’s declared essential equipment for production and mixing/fulfillment.”
He added that “no further control activities are currently being planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 locations declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two places due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two seats were “lost and ... items of the chemical weapons program that it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were checked”
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I am committed to the courage and courage that you have shown in the fulfillment of this most demanding mission that this organization has ever had,” said Ahmet Uzumc’s observer director in a commentary issued by OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad’s government are against each other in the civil war, with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
As far as further developments are concerned, Ramí Abdul Rahman, head of observables, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday inside the air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lázikija.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the judgment brought over the bomber attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali bomb attack in 2002 reacted in an outraged manner to a judgment brought over the last of the settlers who were put in front of justice and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years running away as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for building an explosive device that was used in a bomb attack.
In 15 years, he could be released.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people remained dead, including 88 Australians, and many wounded.
He was also found guilty at several other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve of 2000.
The prosecution demanded a lifetime, even though it could insist on a man with the nickname “Demolition man” due to his reputation as an explosive expert to get the death penalty.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other settlers nearly ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the footsteps of the others.
Ms Corteen said to the AAP agency: “It should be put in front of the execution desk.”
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see other grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when a heavy load was fired in a parked van on October 12, 2002 shortly after the 23rd hour.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber fired a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, three times his doctors “died.”
Mr Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same fate as the other three members of the Islamic Jama cell responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, he's not.
To get 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not that much.
Patek was the last of the assassinations in Bali.
The arrest was avoided for nearly ten years, but was eventually hit in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where less than four months later, U.S. forces killed former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During a court trial, FBI agent said intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to reconnect between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up voluntarily,” Cortee said.
To this day, he has not felt sorry for how much grief he has caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“This year we will see a lot of tears,” said Mrs Cortee.
Patek may appeal to the judgment.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technological extracts on aircraft (but must not call from their mobile phones)
The airline’s passengers will be able to use their electronic devices “from gate to gate,” in addition to calling from their mobile phones, to reading, playing games, watching movies, and listening to music based on the patiently expected new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced according to individual airlines, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
The FAA administration will have to prove how much their aircraft complies with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the crew and the installation storage directives to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Despite the state of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are asked to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They cannot turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain does not issue a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn their devices off again when the plane drops to land and does not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and driving, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at a higher altitude, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stevards, welcomed the changes.
\"As soon as the new rules are safely implemented - and we will work closely with transport companies - it will be a success,\" Glading said in a statement.
In fact, we’re tired of looking like “keepers.”
However, surfing on the Internet, sending emails and text messages or downloading data will continue to be prohibited under 3 kilometers of altitude, the agency said.
Travellers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrapble game played by actor Alicia Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was, as is well known, fired from an American Airlines aircraft because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be imposed because of fears that they might hurt someone if they fly around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may, for some electronic equipment during take-off and landing, revoke the ban.
Last month, Mark Koller of the State Transport Safety Committee, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference in the air of broadcasting towers,” he said.
The industry advisory committee created by the FAA to investigate this problem last month suggested that the government allow wider use of electronic equipment.
In recent years, the FAA has been pressured to mitigate restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrats, say there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to promote, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to interference with navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, technical exploitation of that time.
New airlines are much more referenced to electrical systems than previous generation aircraft, but are also constructed, and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
Plans adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to the new rules for greater use of electronic equipment, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasts than those of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers issue only minimal broadcasts when they turn the page.
But the broadcast is stronger when the device downloads or transmits data.
Among those who are pushing to release restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded a transport plane with their Kindle electronic readers and carried out a test flight, but there was no problem.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee have expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose risks.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Association of Airline Passengers, said he is convinced that interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee have declared that there are only sever reports from pilots to support the fact that such equipment can cause disruption to air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off equipment during flying according to low visibility instruments.
The tourism industry group welcomed these changes and said it was a reasonable procedure for the public to use the technology to a large extent.
“We are pleased that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to safety,” said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was aired from the drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into nature.
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on the oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One man was taken to Aberdeen by a helicopter last month after being previously treated by a Scottish SPCA company at a rescue centre until he was healed.
Colin Seddon said: “This baptism probably migrated from northern Europe when it was captured by a strong wind over the North Sea.
Apparently, he ran out of power and found refuge on the oil platform.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted by requests for help.
At the time he was released, he was in good condition and well-being.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to bring together businesses and define what changes in the relationship with the EU they want to see British entrepreneurs and companies creating jobs.
To this end, we have put in the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we have asked leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov asked 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing UK companies of various sizes and sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernize and grow while the EU is stagnating.
They want to see how the government prefers new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than putting them into a long and laborious process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas - from monopoly regulations to product laws - most entrepreneurs have expressed the view that control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the advantages of being part of the European business area - even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European companies, expressed their consent.
And in the end, our survey of business leaders revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings that have been identified by companies of different sizes and main business groups show that the business sector is pushing for a “significant change” that transfers the impact back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake: achieving a treaty change and a better deal for Britain could mean up to 16% of the vote in the EU referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan of revising the conditions of British membership in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mean a significant shift from the current balance of forces back to Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible, and given how the euro area is heading for a narrower economic and fiscal union, it is becoming increasingly necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our survey show, this means a refocus on trade and a major change in Brussels’ regulatory approach.
John Kerry admits: Spying has gone too far!
The U.S. went on spying at times too far, according to AFP, U.S. diplomacy chief John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, the Minister said it had served to reverse terrorist attacks.
“The first confession from Washington, according to the AFP, was in the midst of a sharp polemic on both banks of the Atlantic due to a scandalous revelation on mass data surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), whose targets were also U.S. allies.
“In some cases, I admit, as did the President (Barack Obama), some of these actions have gone too far and we make sure it doesn’t happen in the future,” Kerry said.
In the first place, he defended the practice so far.
In his opinion, the collection of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the Madrid assassination in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
“We prevented the aircraft from falling, the buildings exploded and people were murdered because we were able to be informed in time of the warehousing,” Kerry said.
However, he once again admitted that the collection of information - in some cases went disproportionately far -
The U.S. intelligence incident, which reportedly followed hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also following German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone.
European leaders did not hide their indignation, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States to commit or significantly restrict surveillance.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
Starting the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means launching one of the largest European energy projects, Gazprom said.
“Today we are witnessing the milestone: the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria, the largest and most important project in Europe,” said Alexei Miller, President of Gazprom.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of Russian exports across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings the majority of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “always removed.”
As soon as the project starts operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says that construction in other countries is expected to start in the direction of the flow at the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the mountainous Kalamun area.
According to the increasingly detailed reports of Israel in Wednesday's airstrikes at two locations in Western Syria, hezbollah had destroyed missiles.
This Lebanese Shia organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its program is also the fight against Israel, which is not intertwined in the Syrian conflict, but clearly said it would prevent the armament from moving to the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The reports of Wednesday’s Israeli airstrikes in Western Syria are still being clarified.
Israel did not comment, but was confirmed by US sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean Sea by the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latákija.
Al-Arabiya reportedly said two warehouses were hit in which missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to her sources, it was a rocket of Russian production SA-8.
Israel's report refused to comment, but military analyst Ron ben Jishai said Syria is continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force is teaching members of the Hezbollah armed section to deal with missiles.
The SA-8 is an outdated missile that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are placed on a moving chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions, they can be easily hidden.
They are equipped with a radar, which, however, turns off after firing, so it is difficult to target them.
Latakiya lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by ruling alavitas.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in Western Syria in the past.
He claims to help protect the Syrian Shia community, which the Alawites belong to.
Now it is reported that 15,000 of his fighters are ready to help conquer the Kalamun army.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army also strengthens its troops.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city of Homs.
According to al-Arabia, the battle is to be retaliated for the recent opposition attack on the Syrian Shia Brigade command of Abbas in Shia district of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army fight back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many rebels from Kusaira went to Kalamun.
More recently, the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted an early election.
The reasons for this were corruption, spending money on over-the-counter purchases and state contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the election results, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens were satisfied with this situation.
That they did not really care, and with the state that was here (the theft and debt of this state) they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not come to the election, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09,384,174 voters voted for a total of 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52,16% of all legitimate voters.
Which is the half majority.
When I add 1,016,829 ČSSD voters to the above mentioned parties, then with the old order (because all those parties were involved in \"the theft\" and indebtedness of the state), 64.23% of the legitimate voters actually agreed to this state.
In fact, the majority of voters have shown that they are not for the punishment of the perpetrators of the theft and extension of the state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD, who participated in it, will be entitled to appropriate laws?
Are we even helping?

The Royal Commission found out that two young men’s Christian Association (YMCA) employees were charged against Jonathan Lord before the lawsuits.
The Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned that, before being charged with child educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse of children.
But before the commission, it was said that in its opening statement to the Commission, the association had never addressed the case of child sexual abuse in its organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked when one of the YMCA employees was accused of child pornography offences, and another when a gymnastics coach at Caringbah from the YMCA association was convicted in 1991 of sexual harassment of children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare said to Gaili Furness, a committee adviser, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in YMCA, which appreciated this organization as a leading advocate of children’s rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission states that YMCA was pointed out that it received the second lowest of four possible assessments in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society of August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him had failed when he accepted Mr. Lord, without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to report child safety violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys he committed during the two years he worked in the YMCA association.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
However, Mr. Hare refused to say that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that prevented the staff from reporting child safety breaches by Mr. Lord.
The staff provided evidence that they were witnessing such violations, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, privately guarding them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them that he liked them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Daniele Ockwell, who was Lord’s subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the chief of YMCA’s children’s services in Caringbah, who was Lord’s superior, was “very intimidating and it was often hard to talk to him about something.”
The CEO said he did not accept the evidence of the staff that they felt uneasy if they were to contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord darkened their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that the YMCA Council in New South Wales shared his view that the lesson from “the case of Jonathan Lord,” for the organization, was that the staff “didn’t report,” and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to let the staff sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the allegation appeared was made by YMCA’s general child service manager Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid a breach of evidence, but it was \"excessively ferocious - and poorly performed.
A child sexual abuse expert, Professor Stephen Smallbone, of the Griffin University, told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that was safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, screening, recruitment, training and staff management.
The hearing was postponed on December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted that the return was unlikely.
In a night interview on the occasion of his fifth anniversary of leaving office, 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he resigned after ten years of leadership, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks about British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Bizko-East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his response to the London newspaper Evening Standard was as follows: \"Yes, sure, but it's probably hard to say, so -
While there were crowds of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he doesn’t go to school yet, and only a few months ago he took the first steps, this boy and his pet, Shetland Ponie Toffee, smoothly clasped three rounds to finally win the main prize and left behind 30 flying adult rivals.
This inseparable couple, with the same height, was praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff.
He stood up against the masters and the ladies in elegant hats, tilted his barrel into a cheerful angle and let his two-year-old Toffee radiate around the circle.
Fenton was praised for his natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given his third birthday in March, and has been practicing with this Shetland pony every day ever since.
His mother Donna (30) said: “Fenton and Toffee are working well together.
They did not make great hopes, but eventually left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were excited.
They all considered him phenomenal and completely strangers wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was encouraging and glamouring.”
He ran through the sand all over the length of the arena, and although he was so small, he did a great job.
Fenton is obsessed with animals - he loves horses, tractors and a farm, and he got two chickens in charge.
As he began, he will be back in the Horse of the Year competition soon, and I am sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show competition said: “Fenton’s are only three, but he already knows how to control the ponie.
They make a great team together.
The judges urged Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork between the ponies and those who lead them - and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes helped, really fell in there with him.
Overly curious newspapers are to be investigated.
The Chinese newspaper, which on the front page asked for the release of the reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
New Express newspapers based in Guangzhou have made a rare public request to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to make up stories about a society partly owned by the state.
The administrator said that the New Express newspaper will now carry out a “full remedy”
The regulation on \"reparation - came from the State Administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television in the province of Kuang-tung.
The preliminary investigation showed that from September 2012 to August 2013, the New Express newspaper from the Yangcheng group Evening News issued several false reports about the company Zoomlion.
“The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was unorganized,” the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide “to impose on Chen Yongzhou an administrative sentence in the form of a cancellation of a journalist’s license.”
He also \"ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out the overall correction of the New Express letter, and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express letter.\"
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express concerning financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, his newspaper issued two requests for his release on the front page and claimed to be worth his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had released false stories for bribery.
“In this case, I caused damage to Zoomlion and the entire media industry and its ability to gain public confidence,” he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I used to get money and fame.
I realize I was acting wrong.
After an apology, Mr. Chen issued a New Express letter on the front page of an apology saying he failed when he did not carry out a sufficient check of his messages.
Recently, several critical suspects have made their confessions on TV.
Experts say the confessions are still being regularly enforced, regardless of the change of the law of this year, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A drug trafficking tunnel was found between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most ingenious tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railways, has been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel about the dimensions of about one meter as one of the most ingenious secret corridors ever discovered.
The tunnel, which taps into the length of almost six football courses, combines a warehouse near Tiffany in Mexico and in San Diego, USA.
This area is full of uncertain warehouses, where it is easy to hide trucks before being loaded with drugs.
The authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be unnoticed.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also held eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the event of conviction, he faces imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate large-scale drainage channels.
The tunnel has been the eighth largest corridor in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October following a harvest of marijuana in central Mexico, which put a problem in front of the drug cartels as quickly as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor of about 650 meters, equipped with colleges, which led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Centre are connected to management.
For example, they offer joint advertising.
New integrated newsroom from Economy in Karlín, Prague.
Economy has taken the next step to transform the Centre’s holding into its media home.
On Friday, the Economy and the Center have a common top management.
“The unification of the organizational structure and staff union are essential for the integration of the two publishing houses into the common media house,” comments Kamil Čermák, the Vice-President of the Economics Board, and the authorised CEO of Kamil Čermák.
Čermák, who will lead the single management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demuth.
The new joint director of the store was appointed Pavel Vopará, who is also subordinated to the advertising director of both companies Zuzana Tylčerová.
Štěpán Burda became the new head of information technology.
Vladimír Piskáček is the co-director of the editors, where Jakub Unger is also the head of the transformation team.
Adéla Pitts was appointed as Marketing Director.
The separate unit of corporate communication is newly managed by Věra Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slabá.
“The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the creation of the content of all published titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company’s business management,” Čermák added.
Economia, owned by the financier Zdenek Bakala, entered into a contract to buy the company Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of this April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktuně.cz, Zena.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najesto or portfolio of almost two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Economic Newspapers, news server IHNED.cz, weekly Respect and Economists and a number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it is the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
This June, the publishing house moved to newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CME will focus on TV business.
It will release almost a quarter of people.
CME will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants to lose thousands of people.
Osekat intends to do all the side-actions and wants to focus only on his main business, TV broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs around 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is CET 21, which holds licences for broadcasting television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech versions of MTV music station.
How much savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV number TV Nova, it is not yet clear.
“This is premature and we can’t really comment,” said Josef Koukolíček, Communication Director.
According to MF TODAY, a significant release from the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact should have on the personnel status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both New Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined Adrian Sarbu after a long-time director, talked to analysts during a conference on Wednesday that they wanted to limit all activities that were not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly limit the cost of production of its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
At the ČKD industrial site in Prague, the cooling tower burned down at night
In the industrial complex of the ČKD in Prague, a large storage tank was burned, according to firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
“The firefighters were leaving the fire on Thursday before 11 a.m., and this morning the fire was extinguished,” Prague firefighter Pavlína Adamcová said.
The amount of pollutants in the surrounding air did not exceed the permitted limits according to the measurement.
The amount of damage and causes of the fire are unknown.
About five dozen firefighters arrived in Kolbenova Street.
“This is a fire of a large storage tank, probably a cooling tower,” said Adamc.
“The complex does not have a functional hydrant network, so we extinguish with the help of transport lines from tanks,” she added.
According to the server tn.cz has made it difficult to extinguish a poorly functioning network of hydrants, so firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The firefighter's officer declared the second stage of the fire alarm.
There are four levels, and the fourth one is declared in the most serious situations.
Chemicals also set out to verify the degree of hazardous substances that could have come into the air during the fire.
“But they did not measure in the air the amount of pollutants that would exceed hygiene standards,” a firefighter said.
British police have given Assange notice of extradition
The British police delivered a statement today about the release of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said he had given 40-year-old Australians “a notice of extradition, asking him to come to the police station and that if he doesn’t, he might be at risk of being arrested.
Assange, under British law, exhausted his capacity when the Supreme Court cancelled his appeal against the extradition this month, thus facing extradition in Sweden due to allegations of sexual crimes.
Because he feared that Stockholm would release him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he asked for asylum.
“Scotland Yard has ordered a release notification to a 40-year-old man asking him to come to the police station on the day and hour he was designated,” the spokesperson said.
Assange continues to violate the terms of the bail.
The embassy refused to comment on the receipt of the release notice.
Assange is afraid to be released from Sweden to the United States, where he can face espionage charges because he has published 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree, Essex, was seen on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found out she had a drink cup between the thighs.
In a police court in Colchester, Howie admitted to the accusation that he was acting carelessly and inattentively.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 and £100 to the accused.
As a result of the tax on the owners of foreign real estate, Prague's London bubble
The Ministry of Finance has pre-calibrated the tax on the income of financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr. Obborn, who in the 2012 budget presented a fee of 7% for the transfer of real estate for buildings worth more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
The income from the property transfer fee in the housing fund in the districts of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which in the tax year 2012/13 reached £708 million, already exceeds the total sum for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “In view of the increase in the transfer of real estate to high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to avoid tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value assets are little taxed regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system,” he said.
He added that “this move may have caused some foreign investors to hesitate to buy properties in London, or that existing owners are reluctant to sell out.”
The leading real estate - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the rich belt, ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, saw an increase of 11.8% last year.
Prices in central London continue to show a steady growth of 5.6% year from year, but they were shaded by a flourishing “home market” where, according to a survey by the Savills real estate agency, they experienced a south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) increase.
Scientists have more illuminated how the movements of the tail are related to the mood of the dog
Previous research has shown that happy dogs drill their tails more right (from the point of view of the dog), while nervous dogs have their tails mostly left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can record and respond to these subtle differences in the movement of the tail.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University said: “People are well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to stimuli that stimulate positive or negative emotions.
We tried the same thing with other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information on how dogs react to the disproportionate drilling of the tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not take long for us to understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and another to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown dog films about dogs, whether in the natural version or in the form of silhouette, to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and show it more right or left.
When the animals saw the dog moving his tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog drilling his tail), he remained completely calm.
However, when she recorded a shot of her tail mostly on the left (from the point of view of the dog with the tail), their heart rate increased and the animals acted insecurely.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs would consciously communicate through these movements.
Rather, they think that dogs have learned from experience what movements they must and do not have to pay attention to.
He said: “If you meet the dogs several times and the movement of their tails in one direction is repeatedly associated with friendly behavior and the movement of the right produces less friendly behavior, you will respond based on this experience,” he said.
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
A dog behavior expert, John Bradshaw, a higher education animal science teacher at Bristol University, said it wasn’t the first study to examine whether the left and right side of the dog was important.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left as they observe an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another professional treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “Dogs are more likely to get acquainted with a dog’s robot when he threw his tail to the left than to the right, when they became insecure, exactly compared to the Italian study.
In his opinion, the difference can be given by dogs not fully interpreting animals in these different studies in films or dog robots as dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs respond to real dogs.
“Although there is good evidence for many different mammals that both sides of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it will probably not take long to understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and another to the other.
Arctic Monkeys on Alex Turner's Disease Moved a Concert in Glasgow
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved the concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with larynx inflammation.
The Sheffield group was due to perform in the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
Alex Turner's illness forced her to move the performance.
The group’s announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone a Thursday performance in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After deciding to postpone today’s LG arena performance in Birmingham, and on a medical recommendation, the Arctic Monkeys group must also delay the performances in the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1st.
“Alexi Turner was diagnosed with larynxitis, and unfortunately he will not be able to stand out.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis first appointed the new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22.
Cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the Pope and are those who elect the Pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are 201 cardinals now.
But as soon as the Cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the Pope, thus reducing the group to 120 electing cardinals.
In a statement reporting this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesperson for the Vatican, said that prior to the solemn promotion of the new cardinals, the assembly of the present cardinals known as the Constorium will be held.
Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February consortium in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from Catholic Voices said the number of electorate cardinals is likely to decline by February.
He said the Pope usually calls as many cardinals as it is necessary for the number of electors to rise again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The consortium next year will be significant, because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation to Europe and, above all, Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope is nominating cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Fourty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, to whom he tasked to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “so possible” that these cardinals would ask the Pope for advice.
But in this situation, we haven't been before - it's a complete news.
Valero said that the Popes traditionally raised bishops from great places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises, so we don’t know who he is.”
GM is downloading some new light trucks in the U.S. for seat back repair
According to a statement from the U.S. Automotive Safety Authority, General Motors is downloading nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) light truck Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to fix the fault with manual tilting of the backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the mechanism for tilting the front seats of the fault may have.
As a result, seat backrests do not comply with the federal automotive safety standards for headrests.
A notice posted on the National Road Safety Administration (NHTSA) website says that “if a car from behind gets an impact, the headrest may not properly protect the passenger, which increases the risk of injury.
Downloaded models were made between August 1st and September 10th.
GM launched the market in June and for this leading American automaker it is the most important to market the vehicle from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the delivery of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the notices to owners due to the government’s 16-day malfunction, which weakened the growth of car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra supplies, which were redesigned for the 2014 models, increased to about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models.
New York Stock Exchange shares rose 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The Desperate Scream of Obama's Voters
I voted for Obama twice - I shared hope for a possible change
Obama’s sincere efforts have stifled the Republican Party’s obstacles
Obstructive policy can’t excuse the frustrations of Obama’s health care website or the attacks of unmanned aircraft
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying Harvard medicine for the second year.
I read a sad book these days.
I thought about this book that during the dark days of my second year at the Faculty of Medicine, I would be encouraged and restored to me a little bit of hope.
It's called \"The Man to Win\" and it's a memory of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish the patient testimonials and go to bed in the evening, the book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and the manifestations took your breath away.
The election ended with a overwhelming predominance, and the television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents were hiding the newspapers they got.
A young group of visionaries headed to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
In 2008, Obama had 82% support.
And here I close the book.
Moving to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It is difficult to recall these optimistic days - they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of wasted opportunities.
In the years after I dropped my first electoral ticket, there was actually a change.
It was definitely nothing I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse achievements - from the law on affordable care to the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy \"do not ask, say nothing - after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I am convinced that the party's obstacles have reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, it is an immigration reform, the possibility of the public to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantanam.
But after many situations where I have defended Obama’s administration from my colleagues and friends, I am at an absolute limit when it comes to the explanations that they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political hopelessness.
The Republicans' obstructions cannot explain their consent to listening to foreign leaders or to airstrikes of unmanned aircraft that kill innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained by them that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans, nor that it persecutes those who reveal the wrong conduct of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlakei, an American citizen, without a fair trial or for limiting public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report saying that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... from the Nixon administration”
And most recently, they can’t even excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on affordable care of a simple website.
I don't know if something like this could be expected.
Whether I knew at the age of 18 that government power might be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected function obviously does not have a predictable course and our public talks will be shaped by an opposition political party and incidental events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have set out above seem to largely be the result of the administration’s own decision.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbroken alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we had once heard of.
Still, the return to 2008 - with Obama's support falling below 45% this week - is getting more and more difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the many promises that have disappeared.
This week, I read a chapter in the book on how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton during the Pennsylvania primaries.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to pace and remain faithful to his mission.
“I want my magic back,” he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, which is leading the dispute over the payment of the 6 million-dollar coal tax line, made this claim when he tried to figure out whether there was a conflict of interest from the table.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr Palmer claimed that there could only be ministers in the conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could benefit from the policy.
“He was in a big conflict of interest regarding paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters became pregnant, he would be interested in whether he would receive parental leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, she officially declared Mr Palmer a winner in the fight for a seat behind the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast area due to a profit of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closure of the electoral rooms?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately and have results on half the seventh night?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark voting tickets.
Is the result possible if someone does not like it?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The election committee studied the possibilities of an electronic vote and recently released a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said his policy programme also applies to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new work “very seriously”
The public service is public service.
“We do not seek any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time,” he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands has changed you and your mood.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an unsolvable task.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after failure was much more optimistic than the one where the participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group, with their hands washed, did better in the next test than the other.
Yet, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who had not washed them.
The results - washed - were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not have any previous failure.
The results of the test show that, according to psychologists, physical purity eliminates really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, the motivation decreases, the tested need to focus much more on further tests.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After the use of the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs wash their hands, but on the road by city transport it is already a fifth.
In hygiene, 85 percent of people wash their hands after working in the garden or in the workshop.
Eating a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks as to how much it is necessary to wash hands after handing over to a foreign person.
In this situation, 28.8% of Czechs and 40.3% of Slovaks wash their hands.
The study showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
“Although it would be in place, I’m afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do a bit better,” said Dr. Klaus Komárková, a skin doctor.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, another indication that the global investigation by the control authorities on suspected currency market machines is becoming more and more frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where they change owners of $5.3 trillion every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in an expanding investigation to respond to the LIBOR scandal (the London Interbank Interest Rate).
The bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
“Our ongoing search continues and we are working fully with FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to this event reported that the RBS passed records of emails and quick messages sent from accounts and to the accounts of the former trader to the British financial authority.
This merchant, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been released from his current position as European Foreign Exchange Chairman at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European chairman of cash trading in Citi, was on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
Neither of these traders were charged with any offense.
Mr. Usher's group for sending quick messages included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people dedicated to this event said.
This week, UBS said that after the Swiss control body Finma announced that it had investigated a suspected machine in the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, it had taken action against any of its employees.
Worldwide, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Office Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office - are investigating the claim that these bankers have merged to move with the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had also launched internal investigations or received information requests from the competent authorities.
Banks have been sifting through old quick news and emails for years to find cases of some misdemeanors.
The investigation reports alarmed traders in the area, which was one of the biggest engines for making profits in the closures of investment banks in the past years, but which has been disrupted by the small volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the severity of the situation when they claimed that with a large and highly liquid foreign currency market it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this does not necessarily need to be true.
A high-ranking trader said that despite the large volume of daily foreign currency trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had released from its stock trading department this week, which caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
“We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem was solved,” said Credit Suisse.
The number of infected HIV in Prague exceeded 1,000.
Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the monitoring in 1986 to the end of this third quarter, the tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is based on the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
There have been 2,063 infected in the Czech Republic so far.
In 396 diseases, immunity has already developed.
189 people were killed.
The number of infected people in the Czech Republic has increased every year in the last decade.
In 2002, the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121.
In 2009, the study revealed 156 new infections and 180 in 2010.
Last year the number fell to 153, but last year it was record-breaking.
According to the laboratory, there were 212.
“The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200 is no longer doubt,” says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who has led the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the infection in 39 people and last year in 47, according to Hlavatý.
In September, doctors reported 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has developed in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to know a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk to a national center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would reveal.
Many people read from the graves.
They slowly wander the cemetery and gain intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities, what faiths they are, how large and coherent families belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status as they taste.
And from the condition of the graves he will find out how the dead are taken care of by the survivors.
The Supreme Court supported Obama’s Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama was in line with the Constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By the ratio of 5:4 the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection Act and the available care - which orders citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 - would otherwise threaten them to pay a fine - does not oppose the constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
The president of the court, John Roberts, stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also supported the remaining parts of the Act on 2700 pages and ruled that the statutory health care requirement which orders States to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise there is a risk of the loss of all sickness insurance funding from federal sources, is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have filed an action to block this law.
During primarys in 2012, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
\"Mugabe is a round donkey - no longer a prison threat, the court has cancelled the law.
Until now, Zimbabwans had to pay good attention to the public speaking of the 90-year-old Mugab, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, since the end of 1987.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Code, a fine of $100 to one year in prison threatened to be fined to the presidential office.
“The public prosecutors should not blame those who comment on the president in pubs or other public places,” the court said in a statement.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the court will appeal against the decision, the British BBC reported.
A number of damaged Zimbabwans, including Tendai Danga, who were arrested two years ago by police for allegedly insulting the president in a fight with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist in public, Mugabe, ended up in prison with a gloomy donkey.
In August, the prosecutor accused a twenty-six-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared it an unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
“The state cannot punish people whose statements will later prove false,” Justice Minister Luke Malala said.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
“The existence of a law allowing to criminalize someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to freely express itself,” Malala said.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with hard hands for more than 33 years, in March Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with wider civil freedoms based on a referendum.
A small step from the dictatorship of one man the country took in 2009, when the agreement between Mugab and the opposition was brought to the prime minister's chair by Morgan Tsvangiraje.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
In Zimbabwe today, it is only the currencies of other countries.
The impoverished economy is facing Mugabe’s inconceivable agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them had no experience with the farm.
Central Banks to maintain swap lines permanently
The temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need.
The banks said this in their joint statement.
“This is a very reasonable step,” said Julian Callow, London’s chief international economist, Barclays.
“Until now, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so that’s not a surprise,” adds Vojtěch Benda, BH Securities’ chief economist.
Central bankers strengthen the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market first collapsed.
The central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at a time when the U.S. Fed is preparing to end its program of supporting the U.S. economy, which could avoid the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract is used by default to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency with the current liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another’s currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on Tipsport.cz.
But I didn’t finish here because there was someone at the office who couldn’t complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn't want to ride to another branch, the registration fell, then I moved, and so my address and ID number changed.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it was not possible because I have a different OP number, address and that it simply cannot be completed and that I should request the deletion of the data and make a new registration.
I did so and wrote on 24.10.2013 for technical support that I request the erasure of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
For that, a long day wrote me technical support that I had to complete my registration at the branch.
This started the email marathon for technical support, where they finally after the 4th Urgant 25.10. wrote that they had deleted the personal data at my request.
So a person would say that he could make that new registration, and here again the problems began, first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (i.e., it was not deleted - it is not personal data, but finally it was also deleted).
So I used another user name and it jumped on me that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have something stored that they claimed to have deleted?), so I contacted again technical support.
On my question as to how it is possible for me to write down that personal data have actually erased 25.10. and to send an e-mail with that error.
I did this (at about 15 a.m. yesterday) and I was told today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) in 13.22 and that it is not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I have been contacting technical support for a week and I’m dealing with them that it’s still not possible.
And what if the truth was what it says (as it is not) no one could register with the same name or same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way in those 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a sophisticated email and phone number and the world wonder, the page appeared to me that they sent me a link to the email to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds registration to e-mail and phone number and the data simply did not decompress as it claims.
So again I told this technical support that they are simply lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they are writing) because what they are writing is not true.
I’ve shown several screens that the registration problem was before 31.10. so ‘false’ registration simply doesn’t affect this.
For this, Tipsport wrote me a sharp sentence - I'm sorry, but by re-registering you, we can't check your claims.
And the communication ended.
It repeats the same phrase that registration refers to the name and date of birth.
They cannot accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the email and so it did not even take place.
So if I sum it up, Tipsport not only didn't erase the data, he claims, but is still lying when he claims the opposite.
The worse is that you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like the error is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after putting this issue on my personal blog, things got a little bit moving and from Technical Support came an email that the matter was passed for review and I will be informed (after a week of emergency and guess and warning of the same error).
In the subway on the bridge, music plays
The transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague has launched the Music project in the subway.
The first vestibule, where, during the operation of the metro, reproduced instrumental music, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Writer Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Cologne Municipal Social House not only his completely new two-CD Czech Calendar, but above all in the program Among us singers Lenka Novoa, František Segrada and Ondra Rumla accompanied by an excellent Orchestra Matěj Benka.
After the introduction of the intro and the acting studio about the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of how they last played in Cologne and in the theater and electrical current fell out throughout the city.
“In Cologne, they made two kinds of cards that I came into contact with a lot,” he said.
He also reminded the native president of Zeman.
“Perhaps we could make a tour of the Zakolans or Dúbraveka near Bratislava,” he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and, if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical work.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astronomical clock, about ice hockey, but at that time he knew nothing about how we met in those squares and chanted who did not jump, is not Czech.
That's also the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we won't play here today,\" he entertained.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang for him a lot of good sleep in the day, singing at night, and accompanied her on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played percussion, all three singers then accompanied the band in the composition of the keyboard, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists together sang a little bit of a cutlery To the side of the heart will sit, which immediately dissipated the auditory.
“I’m glad you were interested in the song, which didn’t surprise me in Kmoch’s town,” said Michal Horáček.
Following the memory of Peter Hapka, Rozznám was presented by František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, rewarded with a huge aplaus, and Hana Heger, in turn, liked the song of Dad Lída Baarová and the Hořečková explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baar by American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb recalled the song Sebastián, and Segrado sang the beautiful composition of Prague, musicd by Jarda Svoboda, the zasmutsky native and the former Kolínák.
However, this has already been the conclusion, thanks to the standing and the addition in the form of optimistic compositions, we live in a wonderful time.
There was another addition on the playlist, but the fans no longer liked it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four sat at the table to sign not only the Czech Calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček her books and even the cover from the legendary LP and with any interested parties also took a picture.
Berdych with Štěpánek will be complemented by Rosol and Hájek
At the final of the Davis Cup against Serbia, the non-player captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navrád was nominated by Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
Czech representatives of the trophy defend, but they are going to play at the opponent's field in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs have been in the final for the third time in the last five years.
“We know we’re going to go to hot ground, it’s going to be wild, and as always we have to focus on our performances,” he said.
“We will go there with only one goal - to score three points and sell the best,” said Štěpanek, the titler of the winning point in last year’s final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bomb Syria.
U.S. commando in Libya.
Top GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis showed exactly what the bombing of Syria would look like.
Without unnecessary humbuck, threats, and millions of statements, they sent out planes, they hit the target and returned.
They would not allow themselves to be stagnated by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole action and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of confused and large-scale, acts unsupported by Obama’s Syrian policies.
And the most satisfying thing about the attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Do not be confused by the media by their claims that the “Syrian base” or “delivery for Hezbollah” was bombarded.
Recently, I wrote about the fact that while US aid to secular rebels in the country remains only on a rhetorical level, Russia continues to supply weapons to Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latákija that became the target of an Israeli airstrike.
Clear message.
And note, Israel has bombed the Assad regime again, not the rebels, although this should be the opposite according to popular internet theories.
The U.S. government has awarded 2 members of the Spatial Force, probably Delta Force.
It has not been known until now that they have distinguished themselves during the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghasis.
The heroic death of two former SEALs members who defended the CIA site in the city was, in my opinion, members of the CIA's secret commando, which is made up of former soldiers.
For a long time, there was speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at another CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices protected by machine nests in Libya (the report on one of these two SEALs members died after a minor hit) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising are the information about the two previously unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. commando in Tripoli, and as soon as they received a report of an attack in Benghasis, they volunteered to intervene and together with five private contractors shot their way into the CIA campus in Benghasis.
Obama’s administration is blighted by the fact that during the attack, the commander was not deployed officially and whole, and that there was simply no doubt about what to do.
Commander-in-chief, he'll probably release these volunteers without orders.
Anyway, the fact that the country operates not one-time, but permanently American commando, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
This is due to the fact that until recently, nothing like this has been officially admitted, and even now there is only a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the United States is trying half to combat terrorism in Libya.
Even though it would be much more helpful to solve the nationwide situation.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It is not so long ago that the media almost sung the Iranian air force for the prosecution of American drones.
Little is known how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you accidentally discover your drone in the airspace, nothing can be done about it.
However, if the Iranians are discovered drones in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that Iran's F-4 Phantom aircraft persecuted an American drone in an international space over the sea, where perhaps the first sharp deployment of U.S. super fighter F-22 Raptor in history occurred.
He came to Phantom to check his armament visually, without registering it on the radar or simply noticing it, and then when he suddenly showed up with him and called on the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened to him without complaining.
It’s no surprise that Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers Vietnam’s war.
He cannot compare himself with Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful recently, the defender or midfielder Viktorie Pilsen František Rajtoral takes the form that brought him back to the team after a year.
He is also successful in shooting, he is stunned by activity, after the intervention, a penalty kick was ordered in the match in Teplice.
Victoria reached a single point in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but in the end, she took one point from the two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
“I believe that we will defeat Jablonec at home,” says František Rajtoral.
The team prepares for a tough match with the North Czechs, who play an attacking football, carefully preparing.
Everything is going to match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as we always draw much from the video analysis of the opponent's game.
“I believe it will be a great match on Friday night,” said Doosan Arena, a Czech fan representative.
The final matches didn’t come out the way she wanted, but the word of the crisis is rejected by Victoria’s defender.
That’s how it works in football, sometimes you have a good form, and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis at all.
“I believe we’ll win on Friday and it’ll be good again,” the defenseman said.
The Victoria team will once again rely on support from fans.
“He’s playing on Friday night and that’s what I’d like to invite our fans who are great,” he said.
“I believe that we will reward them with the victory,” says Rajtoral.
Jan Pétová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it this way, it is not really a step, but a big jump - a jump a few years back, in memory, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash dishes, exfoliate and do your homework.
Even though these “compulsions” were mostly just theories, wishes of parents.
The practice was completely different - to come from school, throw a bag into the corner and run out.
Play with other kids ball games, jump a drink.
Then, during the series Helena and her boys embroidery the chain stitch with a festive tablecloth for grandmother's birthday.
And only after a few alerts finally wash the dishes, exfoliate, in the winter apply wood to tile stones and tasks to do until dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of writing in love lines addressed to school love).
In the morning, eat homemade strawberry marmalade (from real fruit, not those jams that are sold now, whose content next to the strawberry did not lie) and drink it with tea from dried herbs, which we so liked to collect with mom.
I also remember those magical evenings when the grave silence was in the room when my sister and I recorded songs from the radio to the tapes that were loudly filmed in the old taper after my mom.
And then we turned over those cartridges on the pencil and we kept playing one of the same song, our favorite, and we did it with a siphon.
Or we phoned through the table using cans that were tied to each other by a link - and when we were on the phone to hear better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, then the earpiece was a sire + cotton.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live it in such a way that we lacked nothing.
We didn’t need any iPhones, iPads or even phones and laptops or branded clothes.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation, and the best - the addition - to the wardrobe was a batted t-shirt of domestic production using SAVA.
The electronics was enough for us to be satisfied with that mother's taper and, as far as possible, Walkman, who we shared with our sister and who by the way we used only on the train on the school trip.
It was more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, do not be angry, or as I have already said to go -only - out.
When I was a little older we got a video player under the tree, I'm sure his parents were saving on him for a long time, but unfortunately he didn't warm up with us for a long time.
My younger sister threw a spatula into him, saying that the taper was so beautiful, so she tried to get a spatula and a spatula.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last bite.
Well, he still has this incident, poor guy, on a plate from dad.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she was narrating into a video and she thought she was going to play the recipe and not win, so she still can't cook it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate with each other, agree without a cell phone, a computer.
Together with my sister, on vacation with my grandmother, we agreed with my grandmother's grandson, when we meet again next summer at grandmother's - and so it was, so it was true.
We met.
Do you promise to see someone in a year?
I also remember the winter when we were running outside with the whole village, building snowmen, riding on a snowy hill near a church on bags filled with dream.
Then, together with the whole family, we had dinner and talked about the last day.
Of course, we heard the famous phrase before every dinner: ‘Let your hands wash.’
Yes, this is true today, but you certainly don't have a tied soap in the lemon net in the bathroom to the tap.
After dinner, when my dad worked in the garage - at the beer with Jarda from the village, we lay with our mom on the floor, leaning their feet on the tile stove, opening the door and looking at the flames and listening to the cracking of the wood, which fell out of the stones.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We talked together - we did not write messages every day through various cottages, SMS.
There was nothing like this, and yet we knew more about ourselves.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It is nice to remember, especially if I add these memories by watching the album, where black and white photos are neatly glued with black corners.
And if I didn't know how old I was then, from the back of the picture is always written a year of taking a picture.
I see that even though we didn’t have much to do with the pot, and we had two larger numbers for our cousin’s pants, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
I’d rather go back to reality again.
Until 2013, and I will wait for what modern times will come up with, for example, once for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now for the young younger generation at least somewhere - a hundred years behind the monkeys - and I think they're losing a lot of time, too.
I wish they had!

The group, which owns thousands of Nortel patents, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, on Thursday, a company overcalculated in an auction within Nortel’s bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and other four companies for patent infringement in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps link search terms on the Internet with relevant advertisements, says a lawsuit, which is the core of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that work on Google Android’s operating system, which competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and has finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the fight for patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partly motivated by Motorola’s patent group.
“Despite failure to obtain patents at auction that are the subject of the dispute, Google has infringed and continues to violate patents,” the court said in a statement.
Rockstar is seeking increased compensation from Google because it says there is a patent infringement by Google intentionally, according to the lawsuit.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
He came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we are not yet accustomed to.
At first, she laid off her smile, the one who kept putting on the clothing as a defense from the friendly surroundings.
This made her very relieved because it was a mask she decided not to put on the public.
He was honest at home only in the days when she was grandmother and had her grandchildren Elinka or Adika around her.
And of course, when her sons phoned her.
She remembered the lesson from endless business skills courses.
They were really good now.
Don't make her closest sad.
Then he flew to the corner.
Like a dress on a mascara.
November, or any other month, she can’t do the miracle to smile really like she was on a trip with someone who isn’t here for almost three years.
Egypt announces first free-elected president
Muhammad Mursi made an inaugural oath, but his triumphal day will hardly end political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursi promised \"a new Egypt - when it was solemnly put into office as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husni Mubarak, who was established 16 months earlier.
In his office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He made an oath before 18 judges dressed in black talars in a seat built overlooking the Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said in a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
\"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,\" said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by individual governments for most 84 years since its inception.
When Mursi arrived in a small colony of cars shortly after 11 o'clock in the local time, hundreds of soldiers and policemen were guarded.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the court building to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak's presidential provocation, the transport was only briefly stopped to allow the colony to pass through the usually busy road linking the city center to the suburbs in the south.
Mursi’s personal prestige, detested as a non-charismatic “reserve tyre, the Muslim Brotherhood, has risen sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate of Islamists, but also to all those who wish to bring to an end a rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mursi said in a blue social suit with a red tie of judges in a wood-covered chamber where he swore.
Mursi later traveled to Cairo University, where he was to present an inaugural speech.
While he stood by, he received an official welcome from a military band that played a national anthem.
The military commander of Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the chanting of “armads, and the people are one hand, from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as the center of secular education and later became a bastion of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where a revolution was born, which last year ended the authoritarian government of Mubarak, and solemnly promised to take over the presidential powers taken away by his office by a military council that took them away from the ousted leader.
But by consenting to the composition of the official oath before the court, rather than in front of the parliament, as is customary, he committed to the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In ghettos, they're probably gonna be police specialists, they're supposed to ease the tension.
Police specialists should work in ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They would spend up to half of their funerals here.
They'd keep an eye on things and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior is counting on this.
According to him, improving the situation in the country would help mainly - speedy provision of social housing -
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, in the Czech Republic there were about 300 poor houses and neighborhoods a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people, mostly Roma.
Adults in ghettos were jobless, families depended on benefits, children ended up in “special” schools.
She was a wet man.
According to experts of problem locations in the meantime, 100 have been lost.
The relationship between their inhabitants and others is hardening.
There were anti-Roma marches in several places.
Extremists were also joined by people from the surrounding area.
According to the interior, it is difficult for police in areas with ghettos to maintain safety and order.
The fundamental condition is that the consistent application of an equal approach to law enforcement -
It is said that without a detailed knowledge of the place and people it is impossible to achieve this.
A specialist would go on a tour in a ghetto where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his circuit.
In the problem area, he'd keep an eye on the order.
He would also know locals, so he could deal better with problems or crimes.
“Thanks to the trust-based trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a number of illegal activities,” he said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive extras, including 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas should be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (i.e. about 15,5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15% of the sum, funds 85 percent.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being processed.
The project will last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
“There are so-called Romani settlements,” the authors said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will determine where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money these members will be able to release every year after the project is completed.
According to the draft project, first selected police officers complete an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen people should pass this training every year.
The most suitable candidates will come from them.
There should also be a special education for police officers who will work in ghettos.
According to the authors, improving the situation would mainly help social housing.
He said he should motivate and lead to integration.
The interior would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet hostels with specific rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard should have social apartments that would be comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to follow an integration plan that would be put together by social workers.
They would have to follow the rules of accommodation, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain and actively search for a job.
If they tried to integrate, they would advance to a higher standard of housing.
The permeable housing system should operate for at least 30 years, until the next generation grows, in a pro-integrated environment.
The social housing model prepares resorts for local development and work.
They have to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířské vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The coal hill is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Along with several others, it is a proof of volcanic activity in the Low Jeseník in the time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last eruptions were here at the beginning of the quarter.
Looking from a greater distance at the top of the Uhlířské Hill, the striking white plastered baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built between 1755 and 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The host, who stood next to the church, did not behave.
Shortly after the completion of the church, the aisle was planted from four rows of lip, about 1 km long.
The cross road to the Uhlířské vrch is already the third version, the original one stood there after 1916, the second one, from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
At 15 stops there are wooden sculptures made by the local art carving artist František Niemlel.
He used various types of wood from the Low Jeseník region.
Similarly, rock pedestals from the local area form an interesting geological exhibition.
The name of the sponsor is also given at each stop.
The coal hill is the rest of a young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric measurements are slightly different, the last eruption was here about 1.5 million years ago.
It is younger than the Great Roudny (age 3.3 million years) and older than Venus’s volcano (age 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born an explosion.
In it, she threw out a significant amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rocks from the ground, which by burning gained red-brown color.
At the end of this phase, the lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption threw out red, brown-red and places up to black tuffs.
Their layer is up to 50 meters powerful and its part is accessible in the wall of the refraction.
There are spectacular volcanic bombs up to 1 meter in the tufes, and the second eruption was ended with a lava outflow.
At the end of the activity of the volcano, the lava, which today forms up to 50 m of a strong layer of the spherical basalt.
Volcanoes in which the discharge of volcanic ash with lava discharges is alternated are the most common type of volcano.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they are called stratovolcans.
The original volcanic cone was gradually subject to erosion.
However, he was threatened with mining of rocks in the reef on the south side.
The most intense mining took place here between 1953 and 1962.
Tufs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Mining has been stopped under pressure from experts and the public and thus preserves this unique place.
However, the problem is in the porosity and small cohesion of the rocks, which quickly ventilate, fall apart and slide down the slope.
Lom is dying so fast.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-orientated slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
On the Uhlířské vrch you can get to the green tourist brand from Bruntál or from Silesian Kočov.
Automakers can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the lip alley, where a short educational trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel room.
Ivana grew up and spent a larger part of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas in Ořechovce.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move with a small distance.
Ivana was looking for a replacement home for herself and her older mother at the time.
From the well-known, she received a 3 + kk apartment tip in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
“At first, it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the vast forest park and the dam caught me on the other side,” Ivana reminds me of the first impression.
First, I thought it would be a commission for three years.
“Today we have lived here for more than thirteen years, and not only because of the gradual reconstruction, I would not change,” the owner adds.
At that time, the mother and her daughter moved from a hundred-two-meter apartment to a smaller one with 62 m2 area and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The event was not simple, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary adjustments had to be made, such as painting the door or replacing the windows.
The previous owner crashed the core, but the owner was most affected by an unpractically solved and unnecessaryly large hallway, and on the contrary a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
Architects used to define individual zones and divide the room of plasterboard, which allowed for a new location of lights.
The first intervention she decided to do after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to the partial improvement of the standard was to replace PVC flooring with laminate.
She didn't know how to get along with the bathroom.
For years, I’ve been collecting magazines about housing and seeking inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
I then asked the young architect Kamila Douderová.
“It was actually the most important step in the future,” says Ivana.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, the available halls were also able to be adjusted.
The architect combined the toilet space and the bathrooms, and the two doors with the opening wings replaced them with one sliding door, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also accessible enough.
Quality tiles imitate the sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, in the case of a bidet shower.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Douderová continued.
As part of the program How to build a dream took place fast, but a fundamental transformation of the living room, on which also the architect Martin Čenek participated.
The space created by combining two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classical principles of optical division, for example, semi-trailers or Japanese walls.
“This would ultimately violate the openness and unity of space,” explains the architect.
Originally, we managed to separate the sleeping and living area.
It was enough to turn the back of the two sofas and put them in a custom-made box on the feathers.
The dining area defines the shades of the floor and the painting.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used a high-quality marmoleum, and the sliding door revived the wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchenette, if necessary, covers sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new flooring from anti-allergenic marmolea has a number of advantages compared to the previous laminate: softer non-slip surface without steam and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and ceilings from plasterboard highlighted with color is an example of how you can work in the panel room.
I left the colors on the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.
“I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment,” says Ivana.
The tiles made of graphoglass with the motif of a flowered magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underscored modern functional style.
In a small apartment it was possible to store books, among other things, into the space under the window sill.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled remotely.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast of a new one with the older one works well, for example, with a decades-old crystal chandelier and quality art objects that Ivana collects all her life.
The last one came in the kitchen.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides and the owner seemed a bit like a tunnel.
The architect took their number and translated their location.
The furniture in a simple design is custom made, the white area softens the slightly pearl surface.
They fit into a small space thanks to the imaginable solution of the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of a small kitchen revived the glass wall over the worktop.
Unique graphoglass with digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is well maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolias that remind her of her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here.
In the original bathroom was a small bath and washbasin, the new owner chose a neutral shade of tiles.
The large shower corner has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from a given environment, in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
We united the interior materially and colorfully and tried to make it elegant, cozy, not too crowded.
Another condition for entering was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the availability of everyday items,” adds Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court ruled: The time can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Peter Necre could also be prosecuted for possible crimes he could have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
It was only protected by procedural immunity, which refers to manifestations in the House.
In the case of former Members of the ODS, Ivan Fuxi, Mark Šnajdra and Petr Tluchora, on the contrary, decided that they could not be punished for any criminal offences until they gave up their mandate last November, Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig said.
This decision was rejected by the Court of Justice of Iva Ištvana, who wanted to proceed with the criminal proceedings with the Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribery in the form of lucrative posts in state companies for giving up their mandate and not making problems in approving laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to pursue the former Prime Minister who offered them these posts.
The anti-corruption officer was also arrested with Wies Bárta.
Bart’s lawyer Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV Members, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: “Yes, I represent the client in this matter as well, but in view of the protection of classified facts I can no longer comment on it”
According to the law, the case is addressed by the General Inspection of Security Corps (GIBS).
The server tn.cz said that Bárta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server privnizpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment he allegedly sought.
However, the latest information on the Rights shows that the detention of Vit Barta with Petr Lessy is not related.
Police Presidium spokesman Eva Kropáčová refused to comment on the case with the case being dealt with by the Prague City Council.
“We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts,” said Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokesperson for the Municipal Public Prosecutor’s Office in Prague on Friday.
It is precisely there that the applicant oversees Bart's case, and it is therefore indirectly apparent from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under the covert regime.
Reporter Novinek managed to reach wife of Vit Barta Katerina Klasna in the morning before their stay in Prague Klarov.
She was just loading the trunks in the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, Bárt's arrest was expressed by the leader of the Dawn Tomio Okamura movement.
According to his words, he does not know what is going on in the case.
“Vit Barta was one of many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I have repeatedly said before the election, he was neither a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura,” he added.
Vit Bárta, who, in the last early elections to the House of Commons in the Pilsen Region, has failed to run for the Dawn of Direct Democracy movement Tomia Okamura, is known for his corrupt case of the payment of Members of Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was unjustly sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Later, the sentence was changed and Bárta was released from charges.
I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have juice, desire and enthusiasm.
For Prospalo, her family was always in the first place, so she wants to be fully subordinated to her at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and extends his career, or he definitely ends up with hockey.
I want to play the role of my dad and husband.
“I look forward to it,” says the hockey player, who is still looking forward to the offer.
Despite the fact that he's a well-known worker who never cheats at anything.
In spite of the fact that he leaves his heart on the ice every time, and he can pull off his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was Columbus’s most productive player in the last season.
“But the desire to show everyone is still in me,” he said.
He may be waiting, reportedly worth New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season and also have two injuries, Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does your arrival in Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on paper, it's not worth it.
I know there was an article in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that's it.
It was no longer added that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I would like to announce that I have a contract, but it is not.
Didn't you even hear from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
It's about getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When, for example, a player gets hurt or someone doesn’t get hurt and the manchaft doesn’t go crazy.
There are a lot of different factors that need to come together to get that contract.
But there are similar circumstances in New York, right?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't come out to the season, so there's a chance there, don't you think?
Of course, that chance is always there.
The second thing is that you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't received one yet.
Unfortunately, this is the reality in which I have to live.
You're going to America on Friday, are you expecting anything to knock?
I have had the expectations since July 5 when the free-player market opened in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
I'm going to Tampa for kids and for my wife.
I look forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and it all depends on it.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of dad and husband, and I'm looking forward to it.
On Sunday, yours has two hockey matches, this is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in full-time quotations?
Sure, a person can think of a lot of things.
This can happen too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games due to knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it a lot and a lot.
One day, it's going to get to such a stage that all the goals, wins and passes won't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that is the meaning of life.
Let's get the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me except my family.
You’ve had a lot of deals from Europe: do you like to play NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I’m a hockey player, I’m in the first place, except for my family, there’s also a sporty success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
This is what family life is all about.
My children, that is, sorry, our children - mine and my women - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
We would love to see this trend continue.
Because what we're going to say is in America there's options somewhere else.
We should offer them such a chance.
Are you going to stay in America forever?
We will practice it as before.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic in Hluboké and in the vicinity of Czech Budejovice.
And in winter again in Tampa or where our steps will take us.
It’s perfect to be warm all the time.
I was very lucky in my life.
I could say that I went to his side, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took me a lot of things I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
We can choose where to live with a woman.
There are a lot of people in the world who want this so they can choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you have at your age the will to do, train hard and wait for the offer?
Yeah, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and the motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't tell you how long it'll stay.
That can't be planned.
So you can say you're gonna wait this season, how's it going to go, and then you're gonna decide what's next?
I'm at the stage where I'm going day by day.
Recently, the CEO of CZECH announced that the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th Temelín power plant will be postponed at the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and agreeing to Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current management of the Czech Republic is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, for the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give the shareholders a recommendation and not hide behind him.
Babiš: I only rule with Saturday.
Andrej Babiš begins to reconcile that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft in the opposition and that it will have to go straight to the government in order to create any.
President Yes admitted it in an interview with the Law, which will come out tomorrow.

Police evacuated part of Los Angeles Airport for shooting
It was shot at Los Angeles International Airport in the morning.
The police evacuated part of the airport, reportedly a terminal of three.
Reuters, citing California media, claims that men of the law shot a gun of an armed man.
According to the Los Angeles Times, two to three traffic safety officers were injured.
How many people have been injured and whether there are victims, but still not obvious.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more injured people.
CNN: Israel bombarded a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian rockets for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft on Thursday reportedly bombarded a military base near the Syrian port of Latakiya.
The U.S. government said it was CNN.
The Israeli press has widely reported the explosion in the alleged missile warehouse, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack.
The Israeli military spokesperson refused to comment on the attack.
“We’re not talking about news from foreign media,” she said.
According to the U.S. government source, the targets of the Israeli airstrike were rockets and related equipment that, according to Israelis, could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
According to another U.S. security official, the target of the Israeli airstrike was the Russian SA-125.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
However, satellite images of the attack area, according to DPA, showed the battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they reportedly saw SA-3 batteries, including a command center with radar to track rockets and their targets.
According to an Israeli television report, the missiles have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry a 70-kg warhead.
Israel has already bombed at least twice this year, according to CNN and AP.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly declared that it will hit any supply of weapons designated by Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Is the Internet the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to successfully resist this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from recreationals in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual base profit to be between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 million to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a twelve to seventeen percent increase in the record profit of USD 290.4 million in 2011/12.
Graham Turner, CEO, said the Flight Centre had made an eight percent profit in the first half of the year, and the second half began with sharp growth, especially in Australia and Britain, off-road travel.
“To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards record annual profit before interest and taxation,” he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
Businesses with recreational activities took place in Australia during the second half of the year, which compensates for the slightly weaker domestic market for business travel.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
The US trade has recovered after the loss during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to bring a full-year profit for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre’s shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia due to a protest against planned oil production in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
The AFP said today, citing the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
She also claims that the original charges of her piracy activists have not yet been withdrawn.
“Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women, detained in Russia after non-violent action against the Arctic oil platform, have been transported from a corrective facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg,” the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the transfer of detained activists are not clear; according to DPA, it was a planned move.
The authorities of ecology first accused them of piracy, for which they were threatened with 15 years in prison in case of conviction.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace the charges with milder riots, for which there is a lower penalty with a upper limit of seven years in prison.
However, Greenpeace said in a statement today that the charges of piracy had not yet been withdrawn, as they promised.
This means that the arrests are now accused of two crimes.
Last week, the powerful Committee of Investigations announced that the charges of piracy would be replaced by the charges of riots.
But when 30 of those incarcerated in front of the committee this week, the charges of piracy were not withdrawn.
Instead, new charges have been filed against everyone,” Greenpeace said in a statement.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at Gazprom oil platform in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of imprisonment.
Greenpeace CEO Kumi Naidoo said today that moving to St. Petersburg will facilitate meetings with families and consular workers.
However, there is no guarantee that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
“In fact, they may be worse,” he said.
The Dutch king Willem-Alexandre was asked for help by one of the detainees Faiza Oulahsen.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called on him to talk about their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Małiki has a large share in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is partly also the work of fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
At least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction will have to be studied.
The test will also include “hidden text” to motivate deeper reading;
Combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a language exam, and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue a new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other major subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office ofqual, which oversees the exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the exam, along with a new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is “a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system to regain the trust of society” and that we need to insist that the graduation exam is “more demanding, more ambitious and more stringent”
The study shows that English schools spend less time on mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries do.
To compare the school in Australia, maths spend an average of 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have stated that a comprehensive math exam, along with a greater emphasis on this subject in the scoreboards, will likely encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on \"the real world problems - including financial mathematics.\"
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the election, a long-standing dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava Czech SSD was fully agitated.
Everything culminated when Mayor Ostrava Petr Kajnar appealed to court because of the undemocratic compilation of candidates.
However, the case actors did not want to comment too much on this, so that the party would not be harmed even more by the election.
But now the votes of the voters are numbered.
The management of the Ostrava ČSSD called on the mayor of Ostrava to step out of the party on Monday night, and he will probably push to lose his office.
Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What the dispute is about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for the Diary.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
The Czech Republic certainly had a much better outcome.
Did it hurt us that there were disputes in the media before the election?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better electoral result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which ČSSD is now.
It is a party that has its internal problems, is internally ill, and people feel it is not all right in it.
They made it clear in the elections.
What are the internal diseases of the CISSD?
I think ODS has been going through the decline for some time now, and unfortunately, such things are now taking place in social democracy.
It is that lobbyists, influential people, who had previously expected to find their prebends at the ODS, moved to and influence people in the Czech SSD.
It is related to the fact that police are walking around the offices of the Ostrava Magistrate and collecting computers.
It shows that the ČSSD is not only composed of people who would like the good of all others, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as seen in the current struggle for power between Hashkovci and Sobotkovci.
This has been prepared for a long time, too.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a preface to what is happening in Prague.
Haško’s wing gradually held positions so that after the election it could trigger a situation that would weaken Sobotk’s wing.
A person is in politics when sometimes he has to deal with compromises.
But everyone has an internal border where the compromises can no longer be made, and that is my case.
At first I didn't want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek to try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotk's wing as Mayor of Ostrava.
The Hash's wing made it stop.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michal Hašek?
Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks mainly about the ČSSD program and, to some extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I haven't heard anything like that.
Michal Hašek is fighting for power.
I do not understand how the presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the President of the Party.
This is the struggle for power, regardless of everything and against the statutes of the party.
In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has now demonstrated in Prague has ended his political career.
As you have seen, the Ostrava leadership of the ČSSD has not approved you for a candidate.
The political parties are based on the competition, which of their members will be placed.
This competition should largely be based on programme visions and the ability of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are people who do not have the ability or vision, but the political party is an elevator for money that they would not receive elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people begin to come to the fore by breaking the rules without scrupulously, breaking the party’s statutes.
By their practice, they make the political parties of the mafia, and I think they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To point out this problem is more important to me than to consider whether a Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
Is that why you filed an application before the elections to the court for preliminary action against the form of a candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of ČSSD in Ostrava is solidifying its power by the fact that organizations that do not meet it can cancel, set up a new organization purposefully, gradually throwing out uncomfortable members of the party.
An example is the fact that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarik from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and they would rather abolish the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that seeking compliance with the statutes of the party through the courts is the last option, but the moment the other ways and control bodies inside the ČSSD have ceased to work, it is the only option.
An effort by the management of the Ostrava ČSSD led by member Adam Rykala is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is a public secret that Mayor Lumír Palyza has to do with this post.
It is so, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me back.
They promise people positions, they get voices, and then they strengthen their power in the party.
When I got back in the past, everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the Bazaly stadium purchase was just a pretext for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could label me as a man who put money where it doesn't belong.
The city bought a property that has a strategic value for it.
So how do you see this as an mayor?
The District Committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the ČSSD.
But I think it’s like a thief screaming: Catch a thief!
Looking at the results of my work over the past 11 years, I do not see anyone in Ostrava’s social democracy who initiates and promotes, sometimes even against party members, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of a scientific and technological park.
However, everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don’t read it except to prevent others from turning to the places they desire.
Are you going to fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is to work well, political parties must also function well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to drive the state effectively if they can’t drive themselves.
So I don't think I'd leave ČSSD now because I think the one who causes this party's cancer isn't me, but those people who try to upset me.
Olomouc opens in the historic centre of public archipelago
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas Markets and Winter Skating Pavel Spalný said that the preparatory work on the rink was launched on October 26, and from the center there is an operating aggregate for the production of ice.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning, the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The archipelago has an area of 375 square meters, the podium took 358 square meters.
The skaters and the passers-by will also have two punch stands.
“We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stand, and almost the entire area of the podium is covered so that the skaters can move comfortably,” he said.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of Christmas.
Last year, due to the repair of Dolní náměstí, the archipelago was installed directly before the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square.
The repair of Dolní náměstí was completed at the end of the summer, so that the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people were able to wander right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the archipelago was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural programme, will be launched on the Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.
She said she had “scraped” the iconic blonde curls and put on a new, dramatically rustic cut.
Pamella's blonde hair is famous for its role in the sexy television show Coast Guard.
Carmela Anderson is the latest celebrity who shocked her fans with a new hairstyle.
An ex-cat from the Coast Guard got rid of her long blonde hair and put on a platinum gratuitous cut.
This 46-year-old actress revealed her last appearance change when she went to LA on Wednesday and posted a photo on her Twitter page.
It's the first time in 20 years that this blonde beauty has short hair, and we like this restraintal change.
What do you think of Pammy's hair?

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlín will be remedied by the County Court
The Regional Court overturned the charges of the 25-year-old Slovak and twenty-two-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused to blame.
They are threatened with 15 to 20 years in prison or an exceptional punishment.
The spokesperson Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court had cancelled the decision of the county and returned the case to him again.
The reasons that led the judge to do so refused to comment on the fact that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the charges, the young men attacked a 70-year-old man in his house.
The senior died a painful death.
According to the charges, the men cut it, beat it and dig it all over the body, and also the metal object, apparently a gas gun, put about three dozen wounds in his head.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull bone, swelling of the brain or bleeding into the brain, which he fell down on the site.
The young people reportedly took about 3000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the Regional Court, they were the only, moreover, only indirect evidence against the accused's odor footprint, which the expert assessed as not entirely established in the meaning of legal instructions.
The smell traces from the scene of the crime and other cases were in more than ten cases consistent with the defendants, but the police initially treated them as factual and not odorous traces.
In addition, there has been some mistakes in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the blame of the defendants was not proven without doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he apparently fell and injured himself.
Neither did the caller rescue service warn of the violent deaths.
Only after a few days did the criminals contact Olomouc doctors who discovered signs of violent death during the pitting.
The police could no longer work with all the traces from the crime scene that the relatives had cleared.
There was no DNA on the scene.
Young Slovaks lived in Hungary.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was confirmed by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six youngsters, who has a robbery of goldlurgicals on his conscience.
The robberys happened in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopny.
The younger of the accused live in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him from custody after 11 months in August.
Znojmo begins reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the football stadium will begin reconstruction in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who would perform the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living Legend Wayne Shorter Closes Next Week Strings of Autumn
The saxophone grandeur and the legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make the next Wednesday a dot for the 18th anniversary of the Autumn String Festival.
Shorter will perform in the Grand Hall of Lucerne on November 6 with his quartet in the composition of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, the spontaneous jazz improvisation PKF - Prague Philharmonic under the direction of Martin Kumžák will be added to Shorter.
In Shorter's adaptations for the symphony orchestra, Pegasus's song from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older tracks Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, which proves that the Prague concert on the Autumn Strings will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he has worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitaš and the native of Vienna Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade he set the direction of a new fusion style.
He has been performing with Wayne Shorter Quartet for the past 13 years.
A kind of afterparty after the festival will still be the club night of Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triana, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin will present his jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Women say UEFA prohibits the publication of sentences for the referee.
Dagmar Damková, chairman of the Czech Association of Football Judges, has stopped publishing sentences for judges.
It is banned by UEFA rules, which she said in an interview with the Law Journal.
Otherwise, the FACR would be threatened.
She also refused to side footballers with Pilsen, where she came from.
These speculations are really absurd.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of a vote, I can lose 1:6,” said Damková, in response to criticism, which was outraged after Pilsen had recently played twice as much penalty as other league teams.
Thus, even though the FAČR has ceased to publish the sentences for the referee in recent months, Damková assures that she is in judgment for her mistakes.
“Believe me that if the Commission finds out that the judge has made a mistake, it will limit the delegation, whatever the match,” Damková said.
The reason why the penalties are not published is because of a ban on women from the European Football Union.
UEFA prohibits disclosure of such information and punishes violations
“We are very suspicious of us and we are looking for something behind every mistake.”
“We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we don’t stop doing this, there will be tough sanctions,” Damková said.
The other countries respect the ban.
“We were really an exception,” she added.
Should the disclosure continue, the Commission could lose money from UEFA for the upbringing and development of the referees.
They are very important to us -
“Without them, we could not fulfill the programme for the education of the judges,” said Damková.
The arrest of Bárta is related to Janošek and Bem: Is it behind the escape of the hearings?
The president of the Vita Bárta public affairs was arrested by the police on Thursday.
He was also arrested by the head of the Department of Analysts and Informatics, anti-corruption police Jan Petržílek.
The detention is related to the listening of the lobbyist Roman Janousk and former mayor Pavel Bem (ODS).
The information about the listenings that News.cz came with was confirmed by the Czech Press Office as a trusted source.
Listened to the telephone calls of Janouska and Bem, published last March by the Young Front Journal Today and in which both men speak to each other “Mazánka” and “Kolibrik” show Janousk’s influence on the city’s actions under Bem’s leadership.
The newspaper said it was acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, two years later leaked to the ABL security agency.
Bárta owned there.
The server News.cz warned that the arrested criminal Petržílek worked before joining the anti-corruption police for BIS.
Petržílek moved to the anti-corruption unit, which was subsequently involved in the interview, at the same time they were published.
“With regard to the Act on the Protection of Secret Information, I can’t confirm anything or say anything at all,” said Michal Muravský of the Municipal Public Prosecutor’s Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
For the same reason, the case does not want to comment on the inspection.
Six companies out of ten are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six companies out of ten have been intensively preparing for the upcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporation Act since 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the company’s representatives said they didn’t deal with the two key codes in their company at all.
It follows from a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the upcoming term of effectiveness of both key codes, at the last minute, a number of managers are beginning to realize how they can have a significant impact on the business of their companies.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
The business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually occur.
“But they are only a few weeks away to move to a new law without complications for their companies,” said Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively dealing with the new code, 26 percent reported that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
In addition, 35 percent of companies are about to take the necessary measures in the near future.
On the other hand, every fifth company has not yet dealt with recodifications, yet it has a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11% do not have an opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that recoding matters have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts for the largest number of companies surveyed (21 percent), following the solution of business conditions (16 percent) and further changes in the real estate register and liability for damage (ten percent).
Contracts will take place one of the most important innovations of the whole recodification, namely the unification of the modification of contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in both the Civil and Commercial Codes will disappear, as a result of which contract law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
“In the case of entrepreneurs, the new amendment will offer many news with an emphasis on greater freedom of arrangement of relations,” said Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddáný.
In the context of the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing statutory responsibilities.
In addition, the topics related to changes in the convocation and the course of the general meeting (15%) and the representation of the company (14%) follow.
New legislation means strengthening obligations and possible impacts for statutory authorities, especially in situations where companies are at risk of falling or entering.
“In practice, this means that if board members and corporate executives do not act with the care of the proper economy and do not reverse the danger of the company’s decline, they may lose the benefit gained for the performance of the function for the last two years,” Spáčil added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to make Cartier's style a living language
My job is to maintain tradition while leading our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, she explains her position as Pierre Rainero, director of style at Cartier in an interview with HN.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
It travels through mud, river and jungle and provides medical care for free
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat nearly every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in West Africa; only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes Award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes Prize competition, you can vote for him or any of the top ten candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 in order to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon in 1981.
At first, he was treated only with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there she created a hematoma that caused him problems throughout his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had money for that.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the treatment that was simply available.
“It’s not easy,” says Bwell.
You can leave home at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwell's father died in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants.
For comparison only, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the doctors of Cameroon could visit, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in this country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Bwelle says.
Because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
When Bwell saw his father and many of his compatriots suffering, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor of vascular surgeon at a central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped their volunteer group.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people rush into supplies, attach medical needs to the roofs and travel through harsh terrain to the villages they need help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
At one time, the vehicles must push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome as real heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really the reason to celebrate, and Bwell, with her wide smile and unbridled energy, is very willing to engage in local joy.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients on each trip,” Bwelle says.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get a birch or donated glasses or a free birth certificate - a document that requires a school, but which many depleted families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team is doing simple surgery under local narcosis.
Operations are usually done in a school building, in a town hall or at home; after surgery, the patient rises up and goes to the recovery site to free up space for another patient.
With the help of light from the generator, operating room and Bwell hygiene equipment, his volunteers work in the early morning hours.
It is exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
“To stay awake and continue to work, they play drums all night,” Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired, but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Chamber physicians and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to locals.
One man said that after the hernia surgery, he could work again.
“This will change our family’s future,” said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde at night.
He says that this second job is funded by about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at the University of Philadelphia for the second year, and works as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He's always either in a hospital or trying to get money for an organization so he can do those campaigns.
For medical students and nursing services like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
“We washed our hands thoroughly to Dr. Bwell and removed the bloody stains or held the tools,” says O’Malley.
As a medical student in the second year in America, you will never experience it.
Students usually pay their way to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical needs.
But once they arrive at Yaounde, food, transport and study is provided by Bwelle.
“No doubt he’s a hero,” says O’Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, constant reluctance is not a burden.
To help others live happier lives, to fulfill the promise he has given to his father is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy to do this job,” Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to relieve their pain - that's why I do it.

Minister Holcát renews the position of Chief Sister for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
“I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalized so that the nurses of their representative have within the structure of the Office - a representative to whom they can always contact if necessary,” explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves to be given due attention from the ministry.
In the exercise of this profession, it is necessary not only high professionalism, but also human approach and personal convictions.
“I will work with all responsibility to enforce those steps that can improve the position of nurses.”
“We have excellent and smart sisters in our healthcare, but I would also like to appeal to colleagues who do not help us in their approach to patients to carry out their vocations with all empathy and help us to improve the image of sisters in the eyes of the public,” says Alena Šmídová.
Alena Šmídová, the newly appointed Chief Sister for the Czech Republic, also said that she wants to address various aspects of the working position of the nurse and intends, among others, to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
“I don’t fundamentally want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, with everyone having their own competences, and together with other healthcare professionals, they form a pooled working team that provides health services to the benefit of the patient.”
“I am faced with a number of problems that occur in the pursuit of my sister’s profession, I can see these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solution,” he said.
These include, for example, ensuring simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
“In my own experience, I know that some of the administrative actions of the sister are unnecessarily burdening and taking away from them the time they could and should rather devote to patients,” says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate with the team and managing health service providers, adjusting competences, and also adapting labour law issues such as compliance with the Labour Code or non-overloading of nurses at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous steaks, but because of the fear of a possible penalty, they are not documented on a specific case where violations of the rules could occur.
“Where there is no applicant, there is neither a judge nor a judge, and in this case the functions of the Czech Chief Sister could serve as a guarantee of the anonymity of such a complaint and the specific case should be checked by the competent authorities,” concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Health School in the field of Nursing Nurse (she graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the programme of Nursing - Pedagogy (she graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been the Head of Nursing and Other Non-Medicals Department and the recognition of qualifications in the Department of Education and Science.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bedside at the internal department, and continued to work as a teacher at the Secondary Health School, where she was also a statutory representative of the director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the main sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, devoted herself to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
So that I don't bow to hatred.
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After many years of reading, he lived, but did not write, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) published a new novel Wind, Dark, Presence.
That it will not be a small volume, suggests the number of parties comparable to his most famous work, Housch (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl spoke.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - so that I wouldn't get stuck with hatred.
To see the new and new clones of this foolish little thing around you, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
I am not talking about us elders, faces ruined by powerless luster, weckly souls and vice versa ideologies who are trying to sell their product with the expression of a small selling bitch.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, weirdies and hidden formations.
I've been through it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from life on this planet.
I like walking and then reading books at the lamp tonight.
You're talking about a feeling of despair, of hatred.
Was there any evil in the past that influenced you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
An evil occurred a long time ago, about 10 years ago.
It had no name at the time.
Well, after that, I lived.
There's still a quiet boy in there.
I can see another lonely exerciser, everyone in my tornadoes of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I take part in this vast, thousands of years of life-system movement on this planet - the reproduction of an incapacitable future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir of our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game, when by the way of experiment-omyl, another generation of beings arise, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start completely from scratch?
Self-proclaim, or rather, a dialogue that leads the right and left half of the brain, sometimes comes to the surface and forms in the book.
As the periods of peace are intertwined with silently sleeping metastasis of wars, which may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt a tiny lava of my life growing in my brain, and if nothing does, one day I will be silent.
It is a set of questions that he has formulated the brain and puts them into layers that are stored in the darkness - below the level of consciousness -
The neocortex, the gray cortex of the brain, asks the older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient aeronautical circles of the brain tree.
He speaks to furry beasts, asks snakes, seeks an answer in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
Relatively, you often comment on the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognizing, cognitive, process, being exposed to an ever-changing presence, in an ongoing effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are overload disorders.
Similarly - as if you'd been down - a PC, from the program of speech emulator and translators from foreign languages would first get involved in an operating environment, for example Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts ended with a dark green-swimming Bios screen, in a basic system that controls functions and collaborations on the motherboard, between processor and operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what this is about, I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why are you interested in this type of regression regularly?
Because it's a pit.
In the previously functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling, and behavior, there will be a gap.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: “So long he looked into the abyss until the abyss looked into him.”
The pure feeling - that a person is lost, if all hope disappears, psychologically 'will die', and a new quality is emerging.
And why do I care personally?
I'll answer the parables.
Once one fell into the pot and sank, running days, months, and years, he was still melting and reading, and those books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He became a diver.
Perhaps someone will be helped by a phrase written by me, as once the texts of Hrabal helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
One who cannot say anything meaningful, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in his letter to a friend:
I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulation of words and sentences -
From an early age, he read the books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo's submarine, ran around the Shadows in the dark streets.
In the end, behind all this branching of authors and their message, it reads: “The sun bright of the worlds of other Karl Hynek Mácha”
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
In the retrospect, who gets to you through the people who read the book, will he get to you?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, after years, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some difficult life decision.
Books are, in fact, “life” or “worlds”
They are encoded into letters, they have experience, the history of the region of the language.
Whenever we wake them to life, we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden of the divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is placed in a spell - according to old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the publication of the book you - as it happens - awaits a chain of author's readings.
I remember you once liked reading.
Do you feel happy again, or do you feel different after years?
I'd rather just talk today.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they are inconceivable, they do not draw much attention to each other, they are friendly radiated, you do not feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec there was (and I hope that he still lives) one cuddly bookstore (its name is conveniently Červenka), a cheerful champion and a good girl bull.
With one drinker, he introduced me to the various articles of my book, Housk.
I looked them in the eyes and then I was shown a broken, read copy of my book.
I put aside a broken juttle and cried short for men.
We all stood there silently, sneezed, and the drunks were crying.
Then the young blonde moustache couldn't stand it, and with a scream he jumped from the window to the snow curtain.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran to the nightland and were killed by the happy rage of the sentients, the painful souls of the compatriots, and the steak of the fallen patriots - they went out and moved like wolves until the morning.
Each of your books is formally and contently different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text of Wind, Dark, Presence?
It's a story.
It is a fairy tale of one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel Suchodol, puts the words of an old Russian legend in his mouth: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujanu.
There's a dog lying on it, a gray chest on it.
Horrible, terrible, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
We may have been devils in hell a long time ago, and we've been drawing - what a role we're going to play on this earth.
Are you going to continue writing, or are you going to leave it again on the free flow of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and immeasurable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depth and breadth that it completely goes beyond our horizon - and thus, with absolute clarity, we act precisely in the intensity of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with the influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to fight, die in defense and gain new personal territories.
Sometimes there will be a disorder and we will radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves people.
This is the answer to your question - a biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the coast of the ocean unconscious and into a leaky sail made of a dirty pocket catch the tides of a damp wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama withdraws from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama resigned yesterday from his often repeated and ambitious promise that \"if you like your health program, you can keep it -
With an appeal to hundreds of thousands of notices of denunciations from Republicans providers in recent days, the president has accused the American public of lying.
Yesterday, Obama escaped from his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have functional health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In view of what he called “a stir in the media,” Obama called on the Americans who received these announcements to look for new insurances on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex healthcare program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You will get a better offer,” he said.
His administration claims that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who purchased insurance for themselves can be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
“I’m telling these Americans straight: you deserve something better,” Sebelius said in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the Internet market has been “poorly” since October.
“I’m disappointed and angry like everyone else,” she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
Irritated Sebelius, this sentence, which was captured by the microphone, spoke yesterday to a counsellor sitting behind her at yesterday’s committee meeting, which took place after a turbulent exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, concerning whether she had to join Obama’s care program.
For more than three hours during the hearing at Sebelius, he repeatedly asked why the “architect”, the Affordable Care Act, did not voluntarily give up the government of sponsored insurance, and did not purchase the program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you be calling next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy an O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations, and according to various sources from the agencies and from behind the scenes, the hand is already in the sleeve.
The transaction notice should come in November, probably before the start of the LTE network frequency auction, that is, before 11 November.
Kellner’s competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, the company launched a frequency auction for LTE networks.
And to a general surprise, until then, there was no talk about the taste of the company to penetrate telecommunications.
But now Sazku is led by the highly experienced telecommunication luminaire Robert Chvátal.
He began as the marketing chief of Radiomobile (now T-Mobile), then became the director of Slovak T-Mobile, and was last head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The bet plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now she admits she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it gives logic.
If he succeeds in the auction, he will be able to move existing customers from his own virtual operator to his network.
This would not normally be liked by Vodafone, but according to economic newspapers, it could be part of a much closer cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from the agreement of competing O2 and T-Mobile operators who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If he succeeds in the tender on the LTE network (as a newcomer can auction a specially determined spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go into the auction at all, or he will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone releases Sazku into its 2G/3G network (or a newly built LTE network at 900 MHz) allowing the company to launch a fast network.
The bet will begin to build an LTE freight network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Then Vodafone could spend saved money on some fixed internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) immediately obtain a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big mole that will wait for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would have acquired Kellner for O2 and very likely in collaboration with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that the networks will share.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of the Czech business against the global giants.
Will Czech TV ever do without signatures?
In the era of President Zeman, she entered the legendary scene with an ashpot, and so it is not difficult to listen to complaints that collect evidence of harassment of the castle species.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Hardik was not documented in this way, let alone sign it.
True, the executives stood up to the editors.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where such a propensity of some journalists to the earth is taken - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of non-local empathetic accretion.
And when we assume general prodigality, we cannot forgive the question of whether the changes in the circumstances on television seek others, not least unscrupulous power interests, which have not yet been given the opportunity.
The truth is, those who say that there are no opaque attempts to intervene with politicians in developed countries.
However, the truth is that this does not mean that there are no complaints about public media.
Complaints do not question their independence.
They criticize, on the contrary, what they consider to be a tendency which is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
We may not have reached this stage of civilization yet, and this situation is not with us.
But perhaps even in a country that thinks it’s the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories of bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of the opaque situation in which many imperfect human beings are exposed.
JAN JANDOUREK: The Curse of this Country: Presidents on the Edge of Force
It is almost a rule that, at the crucial moments of the country, the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill its state duties.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally younger, he would have experienced the end of his presidential period and events around Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after symbolic resistance, the Air Force could fly across borders, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight there for its legitimacy.
And most of all, the nation would not still have a hangover from that surrender.
Benesh was not a statesman and was still in fitness for Munich, but during the war it began to go out of the hill and in February 48 he was preserved according to it.
Being a little better, he could have gone to exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hacha.
He was elected, saying that “Mr. President will not be able to make decisions”
But he had to, even though the big decision was not with a knife on his neck at Hitler's chancellorship.
In March 1939, Francis Moravec said everything should be done so that the occupation he knew about the day did not go so smoothly and with such a profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, and they didn’t believe him, but they were afraid.
Gottwald had his fellow comrades executed as Moscow had ordered him.
Ludvík Svoboda definitely made it impossible to participate in normalization and had to settle it, already completely senile.
That Husák was a powerless and sick depressed old man in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only thing.
Havel was lucky he hasn't met him in office in the last few years, he was saved the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his actions make it clear that the thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces look like they look and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic.
Or maybe it's a threat, but it's not that much to see.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally (from a historical point of view) good that the president is not completely in power.
This is not a normal state.
Would we not be able to elect a president in this country once again someone who is accommodatingly thinking and accommodatingly healthy?
Remote planets, black-and-white films, or some fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would have thrown up inadvertently.
In the concept of his quartet, which in the large hall of Prague’s Lucerne will complete this year’s festival Strings of Autumn, everything is related to everything.
Wayne Shorter’s jazz saxophonist quartet is the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues have to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as fully improvised chamber affairs and think not of harmony or rhythm, but in film paintings.
This principle, however, is a freshly 80-year-old Shorter, an extraordinary composer, a nine-Grammy bearer, a former co-player of Miles Davis, and today perhaps the biggest living jazz saxophonist, he does not like to explain.
He doesn’t talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of 80, I thought it was best to be surprised.
“Too many people plan everything, and then they are disappointed when things develop differently,” Shorter said.
How the Indians from Thailand raised the sales of the Paris bar
You may be kissing an insect, yet you don’t know that you eat it about half a kilogram a year completely voluntarily.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trending: it is ecological, nutritious and a unique experience you also have taken care of.
He ranked the first insect offer in Paris on his company’s menu at the beginning of October, Elie Daviron, chef and bar owner Le Festin Nu.
The bar, for which the name was the inspiration of William Burroughs's Naked Lunch, would be found in the fashionable 18th district near Montmartre.
With fresh avocados, baked red peppers, ginger and a quail egg, guests can now bite not only various larvaes, fireplaces or water birch, but also taste slags.
Carefully and specially packed supplies (so that insects do not harm their wings, curvature their feet or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is only learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of the Paris bar with its pioneering menu lists several reasons to eat insects.
The first of these is ecological benefits, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
“In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids,” Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young cook does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant pleasure, a feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
“I don’t save the world, I’m just mediate a new experience,” he explained.
By far not everyone would probably be excited about the idea of how he eats a pedigree decorated with a pedigree, but the reactions of the customers of the Paris bar to served insects are very positive according to the owner.
Even sceptics will eventually taste, even if they start with the smallest bites and then eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Green Savings Should Continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has faced a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and the lack of interest of the state to address the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in different regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after implementing the measures, will save significant amounts for heating, but also for construction companies and construction producers.
Every billion invested will bring more than 2,700 newly created jobs to the state.
From the point of view of state fiscal policy, significant leverage and multiplicity effects are also one of the most important growth measures.
Therefore, the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic strongly disagrees with the resolution of the government and asks for the implementation of such steps, which would allow further continuation of the programme, so that further challenges can be made within its framework.
LAW, 1 November 2013
The dog summed up the carpet, the president buried and ended up with Berlins
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lány.
What state of health is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said the U.S. espionage “has gone too far.”
John Kerry suggested that the U.S.’s defense stance on his surveillance programs and said in an unprecedented confession that in some cases espionage “has gone too far.”
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as an “autopilot” with regard to the annoying revelation of the NSA’s espionage activity, which appeared thanks to informer Edward Snowden.
The disclosures caused a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry said, “There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some things that have happened from the obstinacy of the conflict, because that was the possibility, with reference to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War, and then of course, September 11.”
He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that it had not violated its rights.
He said, “In some cases, it went too far.
And the president is determined to try to explain it to people and clarify it, and he is already doing a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA is seeking good and that its tracking operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to fire themselves.”
In the world, there is radical extremism, which is firmly committed to murdering and throwing people into the air and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented the planes from falling, the buildings from exploding, and the people were not executed, because we are already able to learn about these plans ahead.
The president of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday said US lawmakers were preparing to move to Europe to respond to concerns about alleged U.S. espionage and persuaded Europeans to continue to join forces to fight terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week, and that he was worried about their threats that he would stop taking part in anti-terrorist organizations because they were disappointed by the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national security interests of the US, it is really important for Europe to stay with us on one ship, in view of the joint efforts to combat terrorism, Murphy said in an interview with Washington, a member of the Democratic Party and a chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations for European Affairs.
And I'm heading to Europe to make it clear that we have to continue working together to fight terrorism, regardless of their anger over NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some American allies, although the agency’s chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States.
Another revelation quoted the documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA was following German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone and other up to 34 world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper advocated the allies as necessary and said they were on both sides of the matter.
In the middle of the scream, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary journey to take place this year, hoping that both sides and chambers would appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to participate are to be published.
He said he was still working on the program.
Even though Murphy said that the goal of the journey was to help correct relationships, he added that “well-meaning educational measures” would be prepared.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people about the espionage programs they have used for years.
“While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realize that we are not the only ones who are doing espionage here,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is planning to go to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to the hostility already triggered by the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
Australian woman appeals to stay in Thai prison
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15-day prison on Phuket Island when she falsely claimed to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially charged with criminal charges on June 15 on Phuket Island when Thai police said the taxi driver, along with two other men who had arrested her, attacked her in the morning on Sunday, June 10.
However, a record from industrial television later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket police had been interviewing Bamford for two days before she realized she had invented the incident.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security detention facility in Phuket instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who, in the case of her daughter, asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph newspaper that the whole family had “extreme concerns about the fate of her daughter and wanted her back in Australia.”
“Of course, this is a difficult time, but we hope that he will return to us safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 bahts.
According to reports from Australia, she has spent holiday in the Krabi holiday area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to a court trial that would increase her sentence and result in a prison placement for adults.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also attempt to correct a broken picture for tourists, perhaps behind a liberating verdict.
Jágr joked: A goal from the brejka?
He got a puck in the defensive zone and no one caught him again.
In addition, the leak changed after a quick forhend click.
Jaromír Jágr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday evening he commented on the 119th goal in the NHL on Facebook.
“After viewing this video, the director of the Czech Railways spoke to my agent Peter Svoboda and asked him if I would not be interested in advertising on their state-of-the-art Pendolino train,” Jágr wrote.
They say we are very similar.
I guess I'm gonna have to finish my night training so I don't get any faster.
“I am afraid that then the Minister of Defense could call and he would like to make an advertisement for jets,” he added.
In addition, New Jersey has won the second win in a row.
“And most importantly, you’ve noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrova works,” concluded Jágr.
Place of post-election candle electoral goulash
The October elections were rather than the winners brought in a bunch of defeated.
They are not only parties who have not even reached the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and eventually the ČSSD due to its internal split.
Politicians served us the post-election goulash instead of the holiday candles.
Andrei Babiš, who promised voters to change the political style of governance.
The fragmentation of the electoral outcome and the split in the winning party is recorded by the political (for the sake of President Milos Zeman’s) will, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported or elected to the Chamber of Deputies.
Although the president has lost his strategic lead in other policies due to the unpleasant event, he still has several ways to get him back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While ČSSD’s chances of getting a prime minister’s chair in my eyes are giving up, entrepreneurs are approaching Andrej Babiš.
Although the post-election development is still a mile away from the rapid and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government of the Czech SSD supported by the Communists, this development for entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic and, therefore, the economy is only a better report.
Due to the loud resistance of YES to join the ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL coalition (a total of 111 members).
Due to the split in the ČSSD, which has thus become an illegible and weak partner in the negotiation, the result of coalition negotiations may be quite disparagement for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD, composed of non-terrestrials, probably will not pass in the Castle.
Moreover, any government in which the CISSD will participate will be threatened by the dissatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, ‘We don’t go to the next early election by ourselves.’
The next election would be a referendum on the strength of the voter’s mandate.
The ČSSD plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, a more significant increase in income taxes or the construction of a state bank have come under the table.
On the contrary, ČSSD, YES, KDU-ČSL and Dawn parties agree, for example, to support business, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote employment of disadvantaged persons, to reduce VAT rates for selected goods.
The frictional areas occur most in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
Yes, but now it is on top, so the program of the most likely coalition of YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would lean more to the right.
Which, from my point of view, is ultimately a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on everything that is still moving in the economy.
