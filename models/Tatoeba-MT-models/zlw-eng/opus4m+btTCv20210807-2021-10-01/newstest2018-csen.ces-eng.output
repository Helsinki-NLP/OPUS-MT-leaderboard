The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Benefit of Colored People (NAACP) published a warning to colored people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory principles of state and racist attacks.
“The NAACP’s Travel Recommendation for Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay more attention to travel across the state as a result of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents that are currently taking place throughout the state,” the association said in a statement.
The NAACP said it had taken this step under the current Missouri laws, which made it more difficult to defend racistly motivated acts before the court, as well as through the conduct of law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
“There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police because of the color of their skin, being attacked or killed,” NAACP president for Missouri Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
\"We have the greatest number of complaints so far -
This is the first warning of its kind that the organization has issued for the United States.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated abuses directed towards black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black skin from Tennessee.
Sanders died in disputed circumstances earlier this year after he had run out of gasoline while traveling across the state, and the police put him in custody without charges of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also highlights the recent statement by the Missouri State Supreme Prosecutor’s Office, which states that black-skin drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by police.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers of what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
\"People must be prepared - they should bring money with them to pay the bail or alert their relatives that they are going to travel the state -
According to current FBI figures, the report of hate crimes occurred in the year 2015 in Missouri a hundred cases of hateful behavior, reaching the state to the sixteenth place among all states.
A travel alert is also a response to the new Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult for the company to be sued for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which according to ACLU is supposed to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry, but recently the advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by a chef.
Even after 12 years, her family is not calm!
The model Sally Anne Bowman is murdered.
In 2005, a girl from Croydon was murdered by chef Mark Dixi at the restaurant she worked in, and she was put on a spot wound.
Both the victim and the killer had sex and smoked marijuana, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched a careful criminalistic job of searching for a crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He admitted only to assaulting the youth, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead lying on the street.
Three years later, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-friend Lewis Sprotson were arguing with fateful nights.
The killer said, “He was seriously angry and after his attack the girl began to scream.”
“She even attracted the attention of the taxi drivers,” he said lyingly.
The girl was supposed to defend herself, but she could, in vain.
Lewis was supposed to kill her on the street.
Dixie's version was proven as a lie and accused him.
After Dixie’s confession, he spoke about his horniness and taste for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt happy and had to light up marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with his former girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself said.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth,” Linda added.
And after 12 years, the family faces other attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last half of a year.
There are so cruel people in freedom who dig these graves.
“So our daughter isn’t there anymore,” said the Mirror mother of the deceased girl Linda.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Designs cost tens of thousands.
“Czechs are neither protruding nor conservative,” says Martin Ráž, who runs Prague’s Intimity boutique.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic tools.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started inconspicuously, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling trip in Moravia.
One of them did not only bring a bike, but also a box full of unusual looking vibrators.
“Different moles and dolphins and everything was green and yellow and just completely different,” he tells me at lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with another partner with the German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which Martina was interested in, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, in Prague’s Benedictska Street, the Intimity boutique sells erotic devices in a way that is usually offered by luxury handbags or shoes.
And why wouldn't he?
These are also design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you know?
Oh, come on, don't be such puritans!
It was the Berlin-based Fun Factory store, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as an inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone used to.
No covered expenses, everything done in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited rather as in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdenek Šebelka began to consider how to take the Prague trade, where it should be and how it should be named.
The name Intimity liked both.
“It’s related to intimacy, and it’s also, you can say gentle,” he says.
It followed the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space that went parallel with various interior visualizations.
Finally, the variant that spread the shop into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom that leads the bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from the studio FormaFatal.
We found the area in 2013.
At first, he didn’t seem perfect because he wasn’t on the main street, but because of that, he sat down to the name of Intimacy.
He's intimate.
It’s in the aisle next to the main one, so no one sees customers,” says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a trade that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed of entering such a trade at all.
When I entered the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the Zela street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like I was going to the erotic device store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from boutiques with fashion.
Even if there is only female service in the store, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, it does not mean that the male foot does not come here.
Most of the time, gentlemen go shopping for gifts for their girlfriends.
“Men usually can’t guess the right size and choose bigger,” Martin smiles at a common mistake.
These are the prejudices, the cliché that women need some big tools, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith, for example, chooses an unnecessaryly large vibrator.
Similarly, men choose mostly black underwear, while a woman usually tends to move to a pink color.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face it must be clear that I do not know which beats, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
That's such a touch-free hemoglobin stimulator.
In me, an adolescent need to be admired with admiration for what serious tone the interpretation is given to me.
It's like it doesn't get wrong.
And they don't really understand.
It is at a good price and has the perfect user reference.
We didn't believe it would be so well received.
This is a recent revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a marine horse-shaped vibrator.
He made sure that women were more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He completely demolished the taboo that some men can persist in, and that he sees competition in erotic aids.
“There are different options,” he continued.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
This is a favorite category.
With a love connection, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain glitch is the category of attaching vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose devices and buy classic underwear, although they may only use it externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially in younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It is hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would have to be a bit different.
“The question is what to offer men,” Martin said.
We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent - The most is mainly sold by a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn’t look like an anatomical copy of a vagina, but you’re sleeping like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experience when using it.
In Japan, this is completely different.
It's a surprise in me.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot from erotic devices.
“That’s the internet reality,” he explained.
The everyday is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with the use of women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women - just for the sake of interesting - what the Japanese Tenga brand, which is represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, is still about half of what is sold in Japan alone.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not turbulent.
On the contrary, we are quite a friendly nation.
In contrast to countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical business client ranges between 35 and 50 years and - she already has some experience both with sex life and with some tools.
It will come for something nice, quality, which will complement your partner’s life, or for yourself - Martin Ráž and their business partner Zdenek Šebelka take care of each product to see if it is perfectly functional.
We also don’t want to go into the specialties of bonding and latex, because we don’t have space for that, but it doesn’t fit here.
Such things could be reflected in the ones we are trying to target.
Which are people who have always had the shame of going to a sex shop because they were afraid that they would see something like that.
Many of the products on the shelves are really kissy.
It is also given by the selection of represented renowned brands.
Some of them even won the design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever prized was the mentioned marine horse - and it triggered a change throughout the industry.
It started to drop off cheap materials, and on the contrary, to work with health-free ones, other designs, different colors, began to be produced.
The pleasant thing is that behind the design of some is Czech, and even popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by how many people are buying from us those designer stuff Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešová, although they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Venus's balls by Anna Mareš.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic devices can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Ann's story started as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know what materials and how the Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it’s not about large-scale production, but a small series, it’s definitely more expensive than a large series.
Maybe I'm going a bit against the current, but it seems important to keep my development in the Czech Republic.
It could happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything,” she later describes to me the situation of Anna, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
There is no negative or repulsive attitude.
Most people are embarrassed.
“But they’ll start to smile,” Anna Mareš currently has a vibrator on offer, which you can have a personal message on, and this year she’s also planning her own lubrication gel.
In the next year, vibrating eggs and other news should be added.
The Borders of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the limits of what's right are.
Is there anything Martin Ráž would not sell?
It's very hard to define.
What comes normal to one may seem completely abnormal to another, so we define ourselves more like a range of branded manufacturers.
None of them go into extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have a last question: What was the most crazy demand they received?
Just this week, an e-mail came in, in which a lady asked for a Masturbation Aid for her friend with a nature of twenty-eight centimeters.
So we had to write that, unfortunately, we had nothing like that.
The question is, if one of us has not made fun of himself, Martin is measuring me with a suspicious look.
This happens from time to time...
Morning for Karl Gott.
Two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý struggles with serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is struggling with a disease that steals all the memories.
“Yes, it’s unfortunately true,” the singer said.
I know about my illness, and I can handle it quite now, given the circumstances.
“I take drugs to slow the accompanying phenomena of the disease,” he added, thanking the loved ones for their support.
The whole branched family came here to make life easier for Karl.
Eva’s wife tries to be home as much as possible, for her dad to the house on the White Mountain, also the daughters of the first marriage of Zuzan and Teresa, care of the son Karel said Karlas.
He fought cancer twice and gave his experience to Slavík to support him in his difficult treatment.
He has 60 chemotherapy.
He was able to return to work and to the tennis court and ski slopes.
“From an astrologer, I’ve been predicted to be here until 90,” Karel said.
He's a warrior.
He still wants to sing.
“I repeat the words of the song so that I don’t forget them,” said Karel.
The same disease is now being fought by actress Kveta Fialová in the institute.
Do you have Alzheimer's in your family?
Look at how to treat him.
Chile's parliament has abolished the abortion ban, the law will assess the US.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on abortion, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
“I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint to the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years,” said Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and at the end of August it should get a new president who, according to the AFP, is close to the opposition.
The law abolishing the absolute abortion ban, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it violates the right of the unborn child to live.
The MPs postponed the bill last month until it was analyzed by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, MEPs approved the proposal and the Senate did so again.
According to the new legislation, a criminal abortion of pregnancy should cease in three cases: if the life of a woman is at risk, if the fetus does not have the hope of survival or if the pregnancy arises from rape.
There have been similar exceptions to the Spanish El País letter in Chile since 1931, that is, before women were given voting rights there in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortion in 1989 was introduced by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the office of the president.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortion.
Others include Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to thirty years in prison during the abortion of pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, there was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The White House of Trump is now the Statue of Liberty.
An unmissable sign of regime change is the criticism of the statue.
Americans could talk about it as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein's statue at the Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump’s regime, certainly knew what he was going to do when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the subject of President’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set out a symbolic ax on the Statue of Liberty.
It is worth saying that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For this he would be lynched by a crowd of owners of cruise ships and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller repented Acosta: “I don’t want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the world.
The poem that has been placed on the pedestal and to which you refer is not part of it.
Miller's actually right, but as he said, it's not about history.
It is above all the striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - it invites them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: \"Let me go, who goes down, who can barely breathe, who can breathe freely, who is a poor worm in the midst of full cities -
And it is in modern times that we can better watch these “poor worms” on our screens than ever before.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict about the importance of the statue is part of a broad political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to plant a plaque with poems on the pedestal of the statue, knew quite well that she was going into a high political game.
The statue was to express the union of the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, i.e. the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has her own voice.
It also has a very different name: the mother of the exiles.
Combining a poem with a woman's imagination is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have long sought to reverse this meaning.
The famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not really invite anyone to the country, but represents early neoconstructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: \"The statue of Liberty goes forward.
It brings a torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
It is not intended to illuminate the way to the United States.
Limbaugh has an important thing to do.
The importance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damn passenger who, many times after a long and scary cruise across the ocean, comes with hope in the heart of a new country.
It is literally about looking at the world through the eyes of people looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
This is, of course, a perspective that Miller and Trump certainly do not recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Athletics Championship: Neil Black praises Scottish team members
Eilidh Doyle remembers when the British team had only two Scottish members.
The head of the U.K. Athletic Federation Neil Black said that the strong Squadron of 16 Scots in the World Championship team would be “a huge contribution to the team”
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the 2017 London MS, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that something special is going on in Scotland, and British athletics could learn from Scotland.
\"We're trying to understand and adapt - we're going to work on it,\" Black said.
“I’ve talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing.
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000-metre race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing,” Black said.
“Some athletes, whether the Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a feeling of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised feelings that Eilidh spoke to were unrepeatable.
The silver medalist of the Commonwealth, who will compete over 400 m of obstacles at her fifth World Championship, said she was “unbelievably” that there are 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
A cross-country runner on Muir's midway set only five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will take part in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another great Scottish is Chris O'Hare, which will run the 1500m track. This season won the British Team Races and the Annual Games.
She remembers her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish team member, Lee McConnell.
The team’s captain said she was “very proud” of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues got on the team, but in many cases they will also attack the participation in the final and medal.
“The unusual thing about the team captain’s position is that I was elected by other team members. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was chosen by team members is a comforting one,” she added.
“Of course, I’m very proud of all the Scots who got into the team.
It proves where I've moved.
They are athletes who will think of the front positions on the stage.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I’ve only pointed out that we can be proud of this year’s championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to use the support of home fans and enjoy the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've got a second chance to race and I'll enjoy an incredible atmosphere -
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don’t Avoid Public Function if You Can’t Criticize Voters
My father knew of his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for newspapers to criticize him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave her cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away from us, and the foolish and the German will be led like sheep to slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union.
The governor's staff rejected the action as unfounded, and many opinions of the type \"who cares about it\" appeared in the comments on the Internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” many users said.
Still, it depends.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, it is a very popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not insidious.
As it is seen, his state governs itself with confidence and strictly adheres to the principles.
It turned out to be also agile in using Facebook as the main means to connect with their voters - except there is no publication of the first photo with bare head after passing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by its employees paid by taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with Washington Post Hogan’s spokesperson, Amelia Chasse defended the governor with the fact that the blocking of comments took place from the position of moderation of contributions.
However, using an image of internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post met a few real people to whom the posts were deleted.
And that's exactly what they are - the real people who speak to their elected leaders; the teacher, the entrepreneur and the pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie’s lawyer Sarma Ramani, Md., asked for hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
“I politely noted that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other up-to-date news,” the Washington Post said in a statement.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are described as promoting so-called collective efforts rather than being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens,” he said.
What the governor's employees called \"a concentrated spam interest\" would probably be called \"a defense\" by others.
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticisms or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require posting employees to the streets where they would collect and burn all the prints with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that’s exactly what’s happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defamation of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The president of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment in Alexandria, where she prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also got a visit to the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington’s time, the low cost of shipping had practically the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers has tripled, and its leadership has questioned many anonymous writers.
And even in those times, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as \"Juricola - \"Valerius - \"Belisarius -\" and \"Portius - wrote letters in newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by people within the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions critiqued in his office criticizing his opinion on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
He did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and intimidation lies within the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, abroad they consume more data than at home.
Czechs use more of their tariffs than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season leads Croatia.
On holiday, they have more time to surf the web, and under the umbrella, they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of its operators at home prices.
This is due to the fresh statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available as part of the package than at home.
It is no wonder, therefore, that in Croatia, where there are a minimum of ushers in winter, this summer’s data consumption has increased even fifty times.
Italy placed second in the data consumption chart.
Most of the minutes Czechs call from Germany, where many of them go to work even during the summer.
Croatia, according to the Czech Travel Agency Association, visits 800,000 Czechs annually, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences with a mobile phone.
This year's record was July 7th.
Tens of millions of photos would be included in the data transmitted,” the mobile segment director at O2 Silvia Cieslarová said in a statement.
Although Croatia operates in volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria is first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and an active holiday, for which we do not have so much time to wander on the Internet.
“Through Austria, Czechs are heading to the Adriatic,” Cieslar said.
While the operator recorded high annual growths in data following the release of roaming charges, phone growth is much lower.
The number of minutes called in roaming has doubled since last year.
Germany dominates with a huge lead in front of other countries.
“The roaming call is used by business customers on the road,” added Cieslarová.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
The former golfer Ronan Rafferty will hope for a relaxing atmosphere in the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th year of the Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who came from Northern Ireland, will perform the role of the tournament ambassador in the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi on his way to the final this year.
“I’ve watched the Renaissance Club grow up in front of me and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“The players will be able to love the first-rate quality of the field.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an ardent defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands.
The Englishman Eales will first defend the title despite winning the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
“I feel good about it,” said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It is a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when Sharon and my wife really meant a lot to me.
It was a wonderful time that I will not forget.
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, returns to the country after celebrating 50 years this year.
This event will be his first participation from the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“I’m always happy to play at home,” Orr said of Helensburgh.
“You want to be successful and feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I'm doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far -
The three players will also be joined by former champions of Masters Ian Woosnam and winners of senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance fee for the tournament is free. The parking fee is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be spent on Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Land of Gold
When Badina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pelvis.
In its wooden hut, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of local \"nota\" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, she takes the potato and tastes like it with her hands unwashed.
Badina sits on a white ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where at the same time he performs his daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from the nearby urine.
A bucket in the room without a roof completes the toilet.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no field was assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Working in the late hours of the night poses a danger: most men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, there are soldiers in the village.
“In the afternoon after five o’clock, no one will allow themselves to wander around the village,” says Badina.
It is a rare view of the everyday life at Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 older people were forced to vote in the form of a public raise in front of the occupying army.
The current anti-Dutch rule protester movement quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which ruled the entire region, except for foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - an independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolated city, where you can get after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach vibrating the ride.
Public transport does not work here.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of woolen sheets in shades of gray and cutting colors.
Very few Indonesians looked at this place, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, locals worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” says Badina, pointing to his colorful, hand knitted turban, dark t-shirt and bright dress.
“We used to wear only leaves.
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and children's mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it is the Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world of Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of American Phoeenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153 000 inhabitants.
In 2015, Freeport mined gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports wood mining at an estimated $78 billion.
However, this wealth is a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
According to an investigation conducted by the New York Times in 2005, Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150 000 for one officer.
The Papuans who call for self-government threaten this golden Huss and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
The mass killings in Papua during the 1970s were equal to genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 British Archdiocese report, describes the cruelty that occurred last year, such as out-of-court executions, torture - according to another report, particularly popular rape and execution by electric current - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
“It is difficult to count the number of victims because the incidents occur every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian human rights watch researcher.
The whole situation has been stressed by the fact that Papuaan sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are reporting for Christianity, but demography is changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Java Canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to the capital of Jayapura.
\"The original inhabitants of Papua - mom (women) - have thus lost their job -
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is called Jokowido, promised to tackle inequality and rights violations as part of his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former emperor secured his journey to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 out of 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and local people feel betrayed.
“Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope of hearing our calls for justice,” You said.
The fact is that just two months after the inauguration of Jakowi, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers emerged on motorcycles.
Two of the children were told they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was this entanglement and the tone she had been touched and later returned with four other soldiers, said local parish priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a state of urgency persecuted a group of children and beat them with the arms of their weapons, reported the victims and witnesses of the event.
One of the soldiers was then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so strongly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby electoral commission building and the next day things went up.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and military command and demanded justice.
They came up with the ceremony hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - in which it runs in a circle and imitates the singing of birds - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing stones on buildings.
With increasing tensions, soldiers were ordered via radio: “If the crowd attempts at least three times to resist, you have permission to shoot,” according to the TIME weekly, in an official document, the content of which was never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the dangers and urged residents to break up into their homes.
But no one was concerned about his words.
“When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,” Time told the weekend on the veranda of his chest-painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who was the shooter, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
“There were a lot of people all around and a lot of shooting,” he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times according to the words of his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I was going to go to the body to see that it was really him,” Time told the week with a gloomy voice from Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only uses one name.
“I saw him dead...I kissed him.
A Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers had only “secure” the station that was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,” said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a press spokesman for the Papuan police in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many got away with injuries.
The murder report was requested by the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, he spoke passionately to Joko in Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the victims’ families and promised to deal with the violence in Papua.
“I’m asking for an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated,” he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that it would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the violence that occurred in the past.
The excuses began almost immediately.
“Most of the acts of violence have happened a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it won't be a simple task,\" he said.
In a June 5 interview with the Time Week held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to take any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be preceded by a court.”
Wiranto, who was accused of “criminals against humanity” based on more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 human rights violations in Papua have been settled so far, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the shooting victims in Paniai welcomed his claims with distrust.
“In the last three years, I’ve been asked four times, but I haven’t seen anything yet,” Yohanes said.
\"I'm tired -
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid the military will arrest me or someone will shoot me.”
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many of the inhabitants of Paniai who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was killed by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
“After the funeral of the bodies, the army began to look for me,” he said.
And the shooting has not yet stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The battle, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in the nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw the relevant stones and the answers were warning shootings.
However, locals claim that a mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitaristic police) started shooting into the crowd and killing one person.
“There was panic, we were afraid of revenge,” said Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
“I didn’t leave the house for two days.
The Deiyai Parliament demanded the punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in central highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and abducting Indonesian police.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Komaya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has been arrested in recent years and has arbitrarily detained thousands of inhabitants of Paniai, all under the pretext of “providing national sovereignty.”
Some of them will never see again.
Paniai is known as a “tragic and forgotten place” among Papuans.
Oil in the fire pours poverty.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
And bread is equally unattainable.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Already so few jobs will usually be occupied by more educated and rich immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to go into business.
“Young people move from villages because of a lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Because of its isolation, Papua is hidden from the world.
There are also strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists, Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp, were expelled from Papua because of “the lack of cooperation with the authorities”, despite the fact that they were given such a rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, a deputy director of Asia’s Human Rights Watch branch, has promised Jokow to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development in his election campaign, but this has never happened.
“Foreign journalists working in the rebel easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: not recognizing visas and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of news from per-year journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesian in Papua is largely limited.
In March six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of \"various and widespread acts of violence - in Papua, including shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: “In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in force and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations.
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, locals called according to a source who also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan “we want freedom”
More elections are scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but the Papuans say they won’t vote for Jokovi.
“Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people associated with shooting in Paniai,” Gobau, chairman of the tribal council, said.
He wants Jokovi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, in addition to living in constant fear of the robbery army, are waging in poverty, poor education, and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the other Papuans, regard their voice as “a debt” that they must repay.
“They don’t want money, they demand justice,” he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of paniaic shooting, they continue the last symbolic act of resistance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the plot opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus said with his head down.
\"What can we do -
The French Navy has captured a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy held a $1.46-ton cocaine yacht worth about $ 256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment went to Australia.
A four-member crew of the ship was arrested, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America, and after being arrested, the police pulled it to a port in Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to identify exactly where and where the drugs were going and to reveal the “Lithuanian Syndicate”
“We are grateful to the French authorities for their measures to stop a large number of drugs going to Australia,” Col Blanch, CEO, said.
The drugs were destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia is an attractive target for drug traffickers due to high street drug prices.
The country is also facing the problem of the growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current tension is not the first one recently.
Last month, three men were charged with carrying large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia trying to smuggle across the Pacific on a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drinking is necessary to remind them.
The problem can be in homes for seniors, the solution, according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavela Mádlová, could be infusions of physiological solution, which are injected with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are only used in medical facilities.
The older a man, the more water in his body decreases.
“And in addition, it loses its thirst, so seniors generally take less fluids and get very quickly dehydration,” said Mádlová.
Two liters should drink for sure.
“Getting so much fluid into the old man is a big problem,” she added.
In older homes, it is often not observed by a doctor.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually addressed by infusions.
“I think that even there should be gradually introduced so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions,” she said.
According to her, two half-litre bottles of physiological solution can be delivered to the old people during the day.
Lack of fluid can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration is a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
“One day, the old man says he can’t get out of bed, he speaks confusedly,” she added.
In case of neglect, it can result in a stroke.
The blood will thicken and seal the blood vessels in the brain, and there will also be a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with feathers, maximally cotton sheets.
One-off diapers can also be a problem.
“It’s more nursing-intensive, but it would be ideal for the patient to occasionally discover and let the skin ventilate,” the doctor said.
The Torch skyscraper was burning in Dubai for the second time.
In Dubai on Friday, one of the world’s largest residential skyscrapers was in flames. Firefighters had to evacuate all of the inhabitants of 337 meters tall and 79 floors tall.
In the last two years, it has been the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated and no injuries occurred. The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We slept and we woke up the alarm. We heard a cry.
It took us ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” Geroge, one of the skyscrapers, told Reuters.
The Dubai Civil Defense said the firefighters managed to get fire under control around the fourth hour in the morning (0:00 GMT) and continued cooling the building.
Government officials added that they provided replacement accommodation for the affected population.
The incident could again spark a debate on the safety of materials used to cover high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which launched the lead of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015, showed that the lining and external panels used for decoration or insulation were most damaged.
The British police said London’s Grenfell Tower’s insulation and lining system could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in a June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
The survey showed that more than one in five passengers to the United States carry prohibited items on board an aircraft.
A survey of passengers has shown that more than 20 percent of the passengers knowingly or unconsciously carried out prohibited items through the US government’s Transport Security Administration’s control post on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers entered the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers said they were late to discover that they were traveling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The results of the survey, conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and answered by more than 1,000 respondents - showed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had tried to travel consciously with an object prohibited by TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours flew compared to less than 15 percent of the members of Generation X.
The most common items that have escaped TSA’s attention include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly carried out a sharp subject, while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of men surveyed also admitted that they deliberately carried out prohibited drugs on board.
The company said it conducted research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally carried out illegal objects through airport control and how much they did so on purpose.
It’s no surprise that most people who have carried unauthorized items, whether consciously or unconsciously, travel by plane very often.
As the company stressed, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don’t know what liquids and how much they can carry on the plane.
It is no surprise, then, that TSA has seized in the greatest amount of just prohibited fluid.
For some time, people thought that TSA would treat books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Liquid transport is allowed in domestic flights, not international.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on delaying Obama administration emissions reduction guidelines
After 15 states were sued by the Environmental Protection Agency, its chief Scott Pruitt dismissed his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the plan of the former Obama administration to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes in his plan, responding more rapidly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal appeal filed against his previous position in the federal appeal court.
This concerns the latest deadline to be fixed on 1 October, when Member States should start to comply with the 2015 Regulation to reduce the amount of ground ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that the deal would be postponed by one year and ordered a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interventions with local decisions or threatening economic growth.”
Pruitt, who had served as CEO of EPA President Donald Trump for a long time as the state prosecutor general of Oklahoma, served as a reliable opponent to tougher environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden Wednesday turnout is the biggest legal failure for the Pruitt Regulatory Agenda.
Last month, a federal appellate court in Washington ruled that the EPA enforcer exceeded its authority to delay the integration of the Obama administration plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened EPA’s commitment to cooperation with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given time frame.
“The previous EPA administration often failed to meet deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and set plans,” Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits in his previous position at EPA, said in a statement.
“We do not believe in regulation through court disputes and take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that results from it.
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities” at a certain point in time to ensure that the regulation “is based on sound policies and the most accessible information.”
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more extensive transcription of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the rules by at least eight years.
The measures still didn't go through the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group was not going to allow in legal coercion.
“In the view of the EPA, following our trial, it is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground ozone occurs when common harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refiners, chemical power plants and other sources react in an atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists are flourishing with a sudden change.
“It’s worrying what pressure needs to be exerted to change the thinking of the responsible people and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to struggle with the ideological campaign of the Trump administration, which seeks to help polluters and special interests,” he said.
Polyl man with acid, however, is not dangerous according to the court.
You never know what can happen to you.
At one point you are at home with your family and laughing, in the other you suddenly change your whole life from the ground up.
And the worst part is, you can't do anything about it at all.
A similar fate was met by Andreas Christopheros from the United Kingdom, whose face was glued by an unknown assailant who was ultimately released from guilt.
The information was provided by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, Christopheros's door knocks.
Andreas got up to open up.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas gifts to the family that day.
Instead, he was expecting a cruel surprise.
The man he never saw in his life, just after opening without warning, poured acid with the words: ‘This is for you, my friend.’
The pain was indescribable.
“The clothes fell apart like nothing, and I felt only an incredible pain on my skin,” Andreas said.
The family quickly transported him to the hospital, but there his loved ones learned a terrible message - according to doctors, he did not have a chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would be infected, which threatened to penetrate into his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent were affected by the face that doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
Christopheros lost her eyelids.
It's probably the most turbulent thing I've ever experienced.
“You can’t hide from unexpected light, you can’t close your eyes,” he said.
Today Christopheros has 12 operations that are far from the last.
Damages that suffer from acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims of tissues are scarred for the rest of their lives.
“Sometimes people don’t recover and fight deformation and distortion throughout their lives,” said Professor Peter Devulski, spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker is wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that an unknown man had to confuse him with someone.
The perpetrator believed that the man who sexually abused his close person was revenged.
The police investigated the case properly, and then the attacker was found.
He was sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict to the wonder of Christopheros’ family changed fundamentally.
“The three judges finally concluded that the punishment should be abolished because the man is not considered a threat to the public,” Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of corrosive substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior expressed its views on the issue by planning to establish new guidelines for public prosecutors on the classification of cranes.
They should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, the victims of such attacks do not intend to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose more severe and longer imprisonment on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require tighter controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often available in different stores, as these are various cleaning agents.
Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, burned the famous Torch skyscraper, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the population of the 80-storey building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for the Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the opposite.
“It started on the 67th floor, so they told us,” one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant, quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the highest floors and spread down with falling hot ruins.
We slept.
We were woken up by an alarm, people shouted.
“We went down the stairs, it took us about 10 minutes from the 50th floor,” said the tenant George.
Another CNN witness estimated that the flames had taken 40 apartments.
At least two cars were destroyed on the ground when burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, the civil defense said the fire was under control.
The cause of its origin is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the current has fallen.
The large fire damaged Dubai’s skyscraper The Torch in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Nothing happened to anyone at the time, because they managed to evacuate the population in time.
The Torch skyline was built in 2011 and then became the world’s largest residential building with its 352 meters.
The record was set by another Dubai skyscraper the following year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, there was a varied collection of illicit remedies in the sample of Ippolita, from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is at risk of a four-year distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugbist David Vast was positively tested on 11 doping substances, which was a record-breaking number of acclaimed athletes.
The three-stroke player began taking steroids a year earlier when he lost bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She passionately hugged a former lover!
She barely entered the territory of the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
He will also pay attention wherever he comes.
The last time she fell into her arms was her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and had already wanted a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old and certainly didn’t want to hang her career on a nail.
So they came from each other, but the friends remained to this day.
This was also proven at the press conference TV Prima, where they met after a long time.
By accident, they both were in blue color.
At first they did not notice each other, but then they approached and Lucie laughed at Michal’s jokers until she fell to her stomach.
Then they hugged themselves, and the photographers were willing to pose.
Their meeting was not a coincidence, but they will play a couple of lovers in the new series Primy Captain Exner.
Islamists have been given life in the UK for preparing an assassination.
The British court sent four members of the Islamist cell, which three Musketeers called themselves, and according to the prosecutor's office, planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom participated in the training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities thought they were about to attack immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found a partially finished tube bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean \"infidels\" in Arabic, and a gun's maket.
This happened when the MI5 secret service agent put the listening device in the car.
“Recent attacks have shown what horror the defendants could have caused if they weren’t stopped,” prosecutor Sue Hemming said.
Three convictions aged 28, 25, and 33 years may apply for release after twenty years.
The fourth sentenced, 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed to be innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by Agent MI5.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C at Hodonínsk.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained on top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsia, which were recorded in the Hodoninian Watch Tower, he surpassed it Thursday, which became the warmest day of this year.
This was confirmed by the employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records.
On Tuesday, records of 35 out of 145 meteorological stations measured for over 30 years were broken or leveled.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record high temperatures.
The temperature was the same as the previous record in 2013.
In Lednica, Břeclavia, on Thursday, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four-tenths of the degree, and in Pohořelice in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records came from 2013 as well.
There were ten degrees less in the west.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watch Tower, the largest heat in Dyjákovice, Znojmsko and Broda was above Dyji in Břeclavsk, where mercury leveled to 37.8 degrees, but did not exceed the record.
On the other hand, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, according to the ČHMÚ website, the top temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius, according to the Czech Republic.
“The temperatures started to rise there only later this afternoon,” the meteorologists said.
The current heat sinks in the Czech Republic will gradually resonate, and there could also be more significant rain on Sunday.
However, in most areas of Moravia there will remain high temperatures on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia and Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions of dollars due to visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to apply its influence without using force.
It will spend $10 billion annually to support language schools and build universities abroad, push its entertainment industry to foreign markets and try to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not doing that.
The state media is talking about the plan to turn tourism into the driving force of economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year and about 80 percent of tourists came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that despite all its global aspirations China does not welcome foreigners with just open arms, the world’s most populous professor of economics from the University of Beijing Christopher Balding evaluates the situation in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free relations with China, and citizens of the others must deal with the visa in advance.
Chinese authorities in the US are therefore crowds comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if you don’t want to wait long hours in the queue, you have to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance found that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to the country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and lives less than one percent of its population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when tourism uses it to achieve its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China limited transport to South Korea in the spring as part of a gap around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans paid it and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan recorded an increase of 85 percent.
All this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the U.S. Central Bank, China could have left $190 billion as a result of China’s foreign travel, while China will earn about $35 billion a year as part of the sale of currency to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion last year, equal to 44 percent of the total Chinese surplus in goods trade.
A small number of tourists, therefore, the country that anxiously defends the outflow of capital, places a very painful wound.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many parts of China, almost no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, fewer than a million foreigners lived in China.
There are more cities in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not just a crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific work shows that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
You will not find them in China.
To solve these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is being offered is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have been making a big effort recently to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
At the Pilsen Zoo, they multiplied deadlyly poisonous plazas.
The Pilsen Kingdom of poison can enjoy the pups of three rare, deadlyly poisonous fins.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newly born Russians.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 meters.
“It also grows a meter long,” said zoo spokesperson Martin Vobruba.
Youngsters of the other two species, mortals and red cobras will gain strength in the breeding garden.
We can’t tell when people will see them.
“We wouldn’t like to lose them,” said Nursing Officer Miroslav Dohnal, with the fact that it could take a year or two.
Australia's dead animals have come to the world of eight, they are descendants of breeding couple originating from a population around Sydney.
“The individual, whom visitors can see in the exhibition, belongs to mortals from around Perth,” said Vobruba, adding that wintering at 13 degrees Celsius is required in human care for mortals.
One hundred percent success was accompanied by the African Red Cobra.
The couple in the Pilsen Zoo had four eggs in total.
“The incubation lasted 65 days,” he added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to four meters away.
It can cause permanent blindness.
Young people of all three species live in the zoo with mice.
Within 40 days in the garden, they still expect to lie down the pups from the black mamba, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of the telephone interview, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone interview with Mexican President Enrique Peña Niet, Trump urged him to stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The U.S. president accused him of publicly condemning the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t speak like this in the press.”
As part of his campaign, Trump pledged to build a wall along the southern border and said Mexico would pay for it.
His first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. refugee surveillance agreement going to Australia was “a ridiculous one,” and “a stupid one,” and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement, which came under President Obama’s rule, he would look “abusing” after he proposed a ban on refugees entering the U.S..
Trump ended the call after Turnbull explained that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk spoke again at the prosecutor's office for Smolenia.
“He has something to fear,” said Jaroslaw Kaczyński, the president of the government’s Law and Justice Party, to Tusk’s address.
“I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not scare me,” Tusk said, explaining to the country’s current leadership that he was trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
He was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24 crowd, who chanted Donald Tusk! and wished the politician 100 years!.
Tusk thanked for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: ‘I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not scare me.’
The prosecutors, according to his words, do not blame anything, but do not doubt that justice is to serve as a tool against opponents, opposition or people who do not like, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He's been in the interview for the second time.
The prime minister was questioned for the second time at the prosecutor's office, this time he was to be questioned about the errors of the victims of the Smolenica disaster.
In addition, there was a replacement of the bodies in the coffins.
The families were banned from opening the coffins and there had to be some reasons.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
“Keeping good relationships at all costs, despite such terrible events, should have served to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU,” Kaczyński said in a statement.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would ruin Tusk’s chances of getting the most important chair in a union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could happen differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not realize it.
Tusk has been subject to an eight-hour hearing at the prosecutor's office on April 19.
He did not speak as a suspect, but as a witness.
However, many of his appeals to the hearing were seen as part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by linking with various scandals.
In Poland, the prosecutor is subordinated to the Minister of Justice, who plays the role of the Attorney General.
The appeal came soon after the election of Tusk by the head of the European Council, to whom Kaczyński tried hard, but in vain to prevent, among other things, when visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tuskov’s mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlova protested alone.
In this case, Warsaw was also left by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices.
It's from a decree that regulates the delivery of voting tickets to foreign countries.
The Ministry of State has prepared its update, it is currently in a reminder procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted abroad.
“Since the last amendment of the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists,” the ministry explains.
“New representative offices have been established in some countries, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has changed,” the paper said.
The order contains two Annexes, the first of which are the representative offices, on which paper voting tickets are supplied.
This group of offices includes the Czech Republic’s representation in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than 100 Czech authorities will receive a voting ticket in the print version.
It is their list that changes the decree.
Four years ago, the Czechs could have voted at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
The two embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic also abolished its representation in Malaysian Bamaku and Japanese Kyoto.
There will also be no vote at the Consulate-General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Nairobi Kenya, the capital of Dakar and the Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, the Czech Republic has since the last parliamentary elections expanded its representation by the Consulate General in Iraq and Chengdu, the capital of China's S'chuan province.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to select Members in the electoral rooms at representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission shall determine the country for which candidates are elected abroad.
It was the first time in 2002 that the decision was made between South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, Czechs voted abroad among the South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was chosen as well.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is increasing steadily.
About 3,800 people came to the premiere 15 years ago, around 6,700 in 2006, four years later 8222.
A total of 10,571 voters came to the early parliamentary elections four years ago.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: activists recall racist lynching
In 1948, Ford Mercury passed past the watching inhabitants of Monroe, Georgia, and Kodrcal towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
However, before a car with four black-skinned passengers and a white driver was enough to reach the bridge, a group of white-armed men was gardening his way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - pulled long from the cigarette and looked at the car's front glass.
Inside, the passengers shook with fear.
\"We want that n--and Roger--he was screaming a man.
\"Bring me it -
The silence interrupts the cry of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger’s seat.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction of events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws over the “Roger’s neck,” the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to rebuild the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey, were killed by members of Kukluxklan.
No one has been tried for the murder.
“It’s a wonder that in all these years, the only person has not been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even if we know their identity,” Tyrone Brooks said, helping to organize the reconstruction of the event.
“It is a stain on our history and a burden in our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to action. Every year, the community of Monroe reminds that justice has not been done enough.
“We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all,” Brooks said.
“Until then, the healing and reconciliation process cannot be initiated.”
The doctor covers one of the victims of lynching at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI reports obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts were expected to participate in lynching.
No one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that suspects remain at liberty for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the inhabitants of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of a decision of the Supreme Court, the black-skinned people of Georgia were given the first right to participate in the elections that were scheduled for the summer.
And just during the summer election, according to the FBI, a black farmer, Roger Malcom, had to stab the white-skin owner Barnett Hester during the fight - reportedly because of his wife.
In the city, Brooks said Hester had been associated with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and brought her to a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the then important owner of the white land, Loy Harrison, deposited $600 for Malcom.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
When they returned from the prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects was gardening their way.
“As it turns out, the murder was planned and organized by Harrison,” the FBI said.
\"It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local guardians of the law, who not only participated in lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses.\"
Brooks spoke more briefly about the matter.
“It was a massacre because of electoral law,” he said.
“The murders had a clear subtext for all the local black people: ‘That’s how you get if you sign up and vote.’
The annual reconstruction of the event at the Moore's Ford Bridge is organized for nearly ten years by the Cassandra Greene.
Her performance is pictured, engaging, and appropriate, showing a deeply rooted racism that many would like to consider in modern America to be extinct.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and it is even more difficult to turn your eyes off, but Greene says it makes sense.
“No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that hide in each of us,” Greene said.
“But there can’t be a relationship between us unless you listen to what I had to go through.
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June, and the first day about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of the truck - were included in the room where Greene met them with a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an auxiliary director.
He played the leader of Kukluxklan for many years, but according to his words, the role is exhausting.
“I feel bad about it because it contradicts who I am,” Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time.
The actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, also Barnett Hester, practice their roles.
The show begins with a fight - Malcom fights with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
\"Get out of my land n--e--
Rascona can't be.
There's a fight.
At that point, everyone (at least every black-skinned actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
“What happened is Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rough?
“No,” Greene said cheerfully.
“I just don’t think the whites said ‘n-r’ in that tone.
“Exactly, one of the actors of black skin will come out.
“You have to put more emphasis on R.
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility will replace the sense of convergence.
They all want the show to be authentic, just to make it for enough four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct expression of the word on N.
No one's laughing anymore.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of actors and sings Billie Holiday's sad song \"Strange Fruit\"
With every word there is a room to feel sad.
In the background of all of this, about a dozen of those who are watching wipe sweats and tears from their eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple arrived from New York Ithaca, many of them from the nearby area.
Each of them endures a local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them in the crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until this point, she could have been looked at with a distance, but now, standing in the same place where lynching took place, the atmosphere is scary.
In the last words of the song, Greene asks the crowd to look at the inspection of the bodies.
Children knock on victims' heads, watch false blood, and non-moving bodies whisper something in their ears.
“They’re not dead,” the little boy shakes.
It'll be a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
Actors clean the rope and tear their tears.
Bradshaw hugged Marbaugh, a man in a suit played by the leader of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his actors and weeps in their arms; they end up feeling emotions about him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women whispered.
“We know the role is yours.
But you had a reason -
Later that day, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is talking about a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found a word that would express her feeling from today’s performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those ugly words and look at the ugly acts... that people who look like you do because they look like you,” she said.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a current topic,” she added, “it’s just called police clashes.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the court hall, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he started planning a performance for the next year.
\"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think,\" he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows...it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it.
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions for use reads only a piece of shit.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember the times of the past, where the instructions for use of anything was rather a rarity.
For example, my first turntable contained only one paper, on which hieroglyphics showing the involvement of some components, for all there were some secret marks.
After years, when something went wrong inside me, I offered the list to a shaman who wasn't afraid to screw his back plate.
He gave me advice on what the labyrinth-lined paper is suitable for.
Yes, it was a common aid for chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He found a broken wire and allowed me to listen again to expensive vinyl cookies.
A new time brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply adhered to a cut gradient, required about ten pictures.
Especially good was a sketch with a description of how to insert one part into another.
The kit was two-part and another procedure was simply not possible.
To give it in the opposite way required considerable efforts with the need to break down certain plastic components.
My contempt for the instructions ended with my SEAT Leon self-driving.
The year of production 2003 still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, among which was the exchange of the bulb bulb.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual forgot to mention that while the bulb on the right went to exchange really only in three steps.
1 separate the cover.
2. Screw the crack bulb and screw the new one.
3. Drive the cover.
The light bulb on the left had a problem in the form of a battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the trunk of the car, I would paint some spring, a screw that would easily remove the cover, and then I would follow the points 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
Mistake of the bench.
The cover had no place, no space for the slim hand of the Popel, let alone the obese Silesian.
I lost half an hour of my life without success.
The condition was still strengthened by the entry of my wife into the garage, which was called by the mouth and the words which he heard from my mouth quite exceptionally.
“What are you doing here,” she asked.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I miss the vulgar terms, there were only two words left.
I'm changing the bulb.
“And why does it take so long for you to be risked by a phrase that may be her last in a long-lasting union.
I slowly explained to her the problem, putting the main emphasis on the process of torture of the author of the manual, where blessing with hot iron on the hands, which she wrote the instructions, then by cutting it so that he could never write anything again, was a mere introduction to a wide range of instructions by the Witcher, including his commission burn on top of Losin Castle.
“How about we unassemble the box,” the woman said.
In clear despair this happened, and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought he couldn't surprise me.
And that's the day my colleague called me, who was just discussing from the collapse state after the control of two of the State Drug Control Service's officials.
I know him as a leveled colleague who has experienced the impossible in the field and who can interpret wild stories with an unarous voice.
“Imagine I was fined for not having a handwashing guide,” he told me with a weak voice.
Gradually, I took the whole problem out of it, which was that over the sink on the patient's toilet there was no picture instructions to wash his hands.
His argument by the Commissioner that adults usually wash their hands, and that there is no need for pictograms to handle the accustomed activity of decent people, had no healing effect and cost him little money.
“It’s not just that,” she told him.
He understood that the simple rinsing of soapy palms flowing through water is a primitive act at the level of the margin that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So it must be said that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joyful finding that the man washed his hands exactly as ordered by the hosudar of the SUKL.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired and am preparing a detailed plan for action in the toilet.
In the question of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will not arise the problem, in the urine, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to hang the instructions two.
The problem remains with these pictograms, because creating a perfect procedure means an accurate drawing of all the anatomical details, which could raise some outrage at the prudent visitor of the toilet, in contrast to the fact that he can finally learn that he has wiped out the appropriate hole for the whole of his life with a completely flawed procedure.
Pearson releases more than 3,000 employees and reduces dividends in an effort to revive trade
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would release another 3,000 employees and cut the interim dividend by 72% in response to another restructuring program to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancy, which, according to John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to fire 4,000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional £300 million ($394 million) in May under the third program to reduce costs in an effort to raise down trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after it announced a 1% increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Kabul Convoy Attack: NATO soldiers killed in suicide explosion
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, and a NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were injured, official officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to NATO.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians died in an attack in Qarabagh County.
Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack this month - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday during an explosion in the Mosque of Herat.
On Monday, a suicide attacker killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a statement, NATO said Tuesday the explosion occurred after the patrol and members of the Afghan army were attacked by “a local person with a home made by an explosive device.”
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger of life and are located at the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram Air Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the increasing power of the Taliban and the groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a significant source of concern for NATO's Allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed the attack.
On May 31, a major explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people, the most deadly military attack in the country since U.S. troops had overthrown the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops who should help military forces and police in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks that he has reached in recent weeks have been rocked by public confidence in the government, its regulation, and especially in President Ashraf Ghanin’s reputation.
EPA reassesses its decision to delay smoking rules in response to the action
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency dismissed its decision to postpone the Obama administration law that ordered states to cut emissions just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to move “Ozone Standards 2015” in the middle hours of the night, with the words that it is presenting the Agency’s commitment to cooperation with the States.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and listen to their views,” said the EPA director Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's efforts to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed an action on Tuesday saying EPA negotiations were illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama, according to Trump’s words, in an attempt to take on economic growth.
However, the effort of the new government has launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups that are concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA said on its website that breathing ozone-containing air \"can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms - such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnar received a wound and blood flowed!
This, a relatively new singer with us, may have already been registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer has organized a monstrous event for Czech relations, hosted by such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event has not been moderated by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show itself to the public and to introduce his music video to the song Sara, whose baptism they had just attended the named personality.
Few people already know that the film itself, which took place in Russia, did not go without problems, and the singer Ladislav Bubnar himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shot with the stars of the Russian national ballet and he did not do without a proper trap.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, the singer's juice was supposed to indicate a face hit in the video.
At one point, however, he was struck so strongly and directly into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
“It was a wound, I didn’t expect it, I immediately started blood from my nose,” Ladislav said.
The co-workers and producers said it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not respond in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious as to influence the continuation of the film.
We are bringing you this video of a young artist now, you can also record the scene with a punch.
An unleaded version with blood, however, was not preferred to be used.
Joey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Joey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match, first met at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each of them was located in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - unbeatable World Boxing Council weight champion - didn't go down to the hall, where he welcomed Lomachenka, a World Boxing Organization driver.
After Garcia’s victory on a one-off decision against former World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, the two boxers reached the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia pulled his right hand and said, \"How's it going, champion?
Good luck -
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomachenka Egis Klimas adds that the potential fight of boxers would be “the perfect test”
“I’m a former champion in a pentage,” says Garcia.
“I had to gain weight because of the game with Broner (67 kg), but I’m not that big.
I'm a kid for my 63 pounds.
I would like to return to the light weight category.
Lomachenko needs to get back in order to get on a light weight... then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why not do it to them -
Lomachenko agrees.
“Boxing would benefit this game.”
The climate raised a request for payment for a look - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should complete his debut in light weight at the end of this year and next year he will fight with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed an interest in the match against the winner of the duel Jorge Lirares vs. Luke Campbell, who will fight for the title in the light weight in the Forum arena on September 23.
“The match should be made with a style of payment for viewing, this is what the fans are asking,” said Garcia, who later expressed that there is an open possibility to broadcast the match through a television station that comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else gets that kind of attention.
We will wait for the right opportunity -
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenka as “an amazing boxer” and could take part in his Saturday game.
However, Lomachenko was not praised by Garcia when he said that the champion of three Riverside divisions looked “very slow... sorry Mike, but you’re talking about knockout”
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and only then box.
Both boxers said they felt a rising tension in front of each other’s duel.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other game will attract so much attention.
And I’m very pleased to put it in the fire,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, \"I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is mikey.\"
It will be a great match -
A young couple 12 years ago disappeared without a trace.
They found their car at the bottom of the Volhy.
The two young Russians Ilya Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search for them, but without success.
Finally, the police ended the investigation due to a lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years came the sad ending of the whole story.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volhy River in the town of Čeboksary in Kuwait.
Only thanks to the documents left in the car, the police managed to identify the couple.
The evidence survived for a whole decade under water, without them, the police would take much longer to find out the identities found.
The couple was last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksar police, who pulled the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its completion.
Recent test results to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum seekers’ tests in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that more than 80 percent of people have been questioned as older than 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency has launched new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is to more accurately assess applicants in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migrationverket Agency was criticised for failures in determining the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases to investigate, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published a total of 2481 tests conducted from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were considered to be over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the surveyed was “probable over the age of 18.”
In an additional 423 cases, it was decided that the question was “probable under the age of 18.”
The tests shall only be taken if the age of the disputed person is disputed.
According to Johan Gørsson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“In comparison to last month’s statistics are held in busy tracks and numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that “the person concerned is 18 years old or older.”
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases, the person said he would be 18 this year.
Criticism also awaited the medical method of determining age, which includes the X-ray of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then assessed by dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who deals, among other things, with the assessment of the biological maturity of people to determine the age when he passed through puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue, and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is in some sense very uncertain.
If we can’t determine age with accuracy, we shouldn’t pretend the opposite,” Metro said.
Forensic medical agency Agency’s Gêøransson advocated the decision by saying: “In general, it can be said that the risk of misjudgment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person being asked is just below the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all respondents.
Trump threatened Mexico on the phone.
U.S. President Donald Trump, in a January call to Mexican President Enrique Peň, threatened not to meet him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would somehow be arranged, even if he admitted that he would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It follows from the transcripts of the talks published by the American newspaper The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after joining the post of Trump Pena Nieta, he was indiplomatically disciplined for building critically on his plan to build a wall.
He described South neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed on the Mexican president to publicly say his government would never pay for the wall.
“You can’t say this to the press,” Trump repeatedly said in a January 27 interview and threatened to interrupt contacts with the Mexican president if he continued to make a relentless statement.
Funding is supposed to come up with something, and it will eventually work out well.
“But if you say Mexico won’t pay for the wall, then I don’t want to meet you guys anymore, because that’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
The wall is the least important thing we talk about, but perhaps the most important thing.
Trump issued an executive order to build the wall shortly after taking over power.
Mexico’s construction and financing of a 3,200-mile-long wall has been denied, and the relations of the two countries have also escalated.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would be valid for the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
To this end, he was forced to exchange views on the agreement that Australia would provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for accepting persons from internment facilities in Pacific island states.
Trump thought the deal was stupid at first, but later he came to it.
“You can certainly say that this is not the deal you’ve made, but you’ll have to stick to it,” Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost entrenched, for example, when Trump appreciated as a good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
“You’re worse than me,” Trump joked.
But suddenly the tone of the conversation was sharpened.
“I hate receiving these people,” Trump said.
I assure you they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
“They won’t be great people to work for local dairy,” he said.
In an interview, he said a refugee could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump led talks at the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, with a number of world statesmen, often in one day.
The call to Turnbull was the least pleasant of the day.
Before he ended, he stressed that he had had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
They executed the Rana killer before the crowd.
Her father also looked at her.
The execution took place in the square in the capital city of Yemen Saná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose a small Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her father to the house, raped her, and smothered her with his bare hands.
Then he raped her body, which he then threw near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl hit the whole country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari was the first thousand-headed crowd to meet to witness execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim’s father told the media his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I've been relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
Even other members of the family were present, together with the crowd they cried out a password - that justice might live -
The attacker in the square brought a police van from which he was removed.
The police put him on his stomach.
One of the men turned his gun against him and launched a fire from the immediate vicinity.
The present crowd celebrated every wound that was burned.
Mr al-Almatari told MailOnline that justice was carried out in accordance with the country's legal system.
“Justice, Allah, and Sharia’s law have won,” he added.
I was standing at Sana's Square of Liberation and waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the marina.
We took Ran's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
Both I and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hateful madness, and the killer would be caught and lynched.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of Shia Houthi.
But initially, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 whips after the arrest, but his act was so outraged that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
His family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, she found evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could be his motive?
Even the animal would be more merciful to the morning.
“Our family has no enemies, and the injury that carried Ran's body was terrible,” he told the media.
“The morning disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her photo hung everywhere,” he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer parents who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body was found.
The wound was going out with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We were looking everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took the cars and drove around, but we were looking in vain.
The people of Yemen were abhorred by crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held and demand immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read the current crowd's investigation record to calm them down.
The accused, apparently, did not show regret over his actions.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the police read to him the sentence, but only the convicted one looked at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many records on the Internet that were made by the crowd.
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Political Party
West Virginia’s Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night that he was moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats turned their back on me,” Justice’s governor said.
“Today, after long prayer and thinking, I tell you... today as a resident of West Virginia, I tell you that I can no longer support you from the position of a democratic governor.
The crowd of the watchmen exploded in joy.
“Tomorrow I’ll sign up to the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I can tell you it’s time to jump into another game.
Trump had previously promised people an important announcement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited large assets from his father and owns several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying: “The passage of the Governor of Justice is another blow to a democratic party that puts us in the way instead of causing us to raise our country.
“For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative authorities in history, the announcement by the Governor of Justice is the last drop for a no-leader who is in vain trying to find a positive and unifying report,” RNC President Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia’s “honest” excuse for doping scandal
Former athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but repeated again that it was not yet the right time to return Russia to the sports world.
Russian athletic chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the MS in athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way.”
Despite his comments, IAAF members voted to maintain a ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report showed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
“I think today we have seen very sincere answers and presentations,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All the members of the council and congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had admitted its mistake and worked out all its forces to correct and restore the proper function of the entire Federation,” he said.
Coe said he was also “comfortable” that Russia adopted criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today has been very successful and we have progressed to the next stage, but Congress supports the recommendations of the crisis crew on the preservation of the punishment that has been thrown down on Russia,” Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can to stabilize the situation in the coming months.
Our efforts have always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest,” he ended his speech.
At the M.S. in Athletics, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag to comply with strict IAAF rules.
The head of the IAAF Crisis Staff, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
Drug testing is still inconvenient, and the exclusion of trainers continues to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF presentation.
The CzechTrade state contract was awarded by the company Františka Savova, whose state is prosecuted.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta František Savov.
The officials awarded him 100 percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecuted Savov for tax fraud and demanded his release into the Czech Republic.
In April, the CzechTrade Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued a public contract for four years of content management for the BusinessInfo portal.
A total order of CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta by the entrepreneur František Savov.
In 2014, the Czech police accused him of tax evasion and prosecuted him for escape.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic requested his release.
In the case, the server Aktuně.cz alerted.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade had to decide from 60 percent the price offered and from the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
Savova’s company has greatly helped the second criterion.
According to the information, Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all partial quality criteria.
This was what moved her to the next candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with a sum of 404,900 crowns per month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it has received 62 points from the assessors in all the qualitative criteria of the sub-average rating.
The tender was also attended by the consultant company BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which falls as well as the server Aktunalne.cz under the label Economy.
VLM has raised several objections to the outcome of the tender, with its assessment being considered unfair and under-founded.
Following their rejection, it decided to challenge competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of ÚOHS.
He believes that CzechTrade has acted against the law.
The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision to select a public contract supplier on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, a clearly favorite participant in the Young Front, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers,” the application for the opening of the proceedings filed at ÚOHS this week, which was published by the server Currently.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM Michal Klíma, the ranking of the selection committee appears to be untrustworthy and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project among all its members as extremely suspicious.
“Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious,” he said.
CzechTrade has not yet expressed its views on the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency does not fundamentally comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract mentioned by you is legally published in the Contractor’s Profile and in the Public Procurement Journal.
“After completion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but we cannot comment on its progress during the contract,” the media representative of the Štěpán Dlouhý said in a statement.
The young front responded by declaring it extremely problematic that the publishing house Economica hit the article in Aktunaly.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact has been mentioned in that article.
In the tender, she could have been helped by the fact that she was the one who provided the BusinessInfo editorial services portal in the previous four years.
The contract was first competed in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martim Cuba ODS.
František Savova blames the tax evasion police in connection with the excessive VAT deduction of his company, which caused the Czech state alleged damage to up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, under whose influence the Mafra publishing house, is behind his criminalization.
Last year, the London court rejected Savovo’s appeal against the issue, but the entrepreneur appealed.
“From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, from the UK we have not received any understanding of the acquisition of the legal power of the judgment to this day,” said the spokesperson for the Prague City Council, Štěpánka Zenklová.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov at Harvestor Limited was based in Cyprus, which was controlled by the Czech-Doubějovice brewery Samson, and by the Cyprus company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
He should also control Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the transfer of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist walked along the trails and the park, ended up in the boilers.
The motorcyclist attracted attention by a careless ride on the streets, trails and park roads in Úšovice.
When the guard began to persecute him, he decided to go in the direction of the Tent.
“Policies of the man with increased caution persecuted the city when he failed to drive on one of the side roads behind the Marianske Lazne and entered the field where he crashed with the motorcycle,” police spokesman Daniel Dvorak said.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to arrive at the accident, which transported the injured motorcyclist to a hospital in Pilsen.
The police later found that the motorcyclist did not own a driving license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were stolen, his production number was cut off and the production label itself was removed.
It is so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
“The breath test performed on the site of alcohol in the driver was excluded, but a positive result was found on the substance metamphetamine,” the police spokesman added.
How football rules affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules on restricting European football club funding do not interfere with Neymar’s record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 provide that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are several financial conditions for Neymar’s transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has grown rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar to such a star football family.
The clubs can spend huge amounts on the purchase of players, but on the other hand, they have to prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overhead costs of football-related business activities.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after joining the UEFA Director’s chair in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that are in debt in pursuit of new reinforcements ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to secure them.
In 2011, FFP’s rules redirected its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spend a great amount for the player y to build a global brand - it was suddenly not so advantageous.
Within the current three-year trial period, which will end in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini having to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Čeferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
“The FFP rules still apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future,” said Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with the FFP rules last week.
Although PSG has paid an amount for Neymar’s redemption in a one-time payment, it may, for accounting purposes, extend the amount over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44.4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of the highest FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
The PSG fined EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a command to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA pays attention to teams that may attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG as soon as the financing exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to ban the settlement of the amount.
UEFA took the same action in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Some of Neymar’s incomes in PSG could be paid by an MS organizational committee in 2022 football in Qatar.
However, PSG and MS 2022 representatives in Qatar denied that Neymat should become MS ambassador in football and that such a maneuver would be easily revealed by UEFY officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to UEFA, the person who was consecrated on Tuesday did not initiate any investigations on Neymar’s transfer to PSG.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous because it is not justified to comment on the situation with PSG, the Associated Press said.
The latest financial statements published show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and sales of shirts.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
Spanish league officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, have sought to deplete Neymar’s departure, arguing that the PSG violates the FFP rules.
“It’s a clear case of the “financial doping” of the club and state,” said the president of the League of Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by the Qatari Syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns the American sports magnate, shares the same attitude of La League on club funding.
“It’s a result of property that has changed the football world from scratch in the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as the club owner becomes the owner, everything is possible.
Complying with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult, because the state may have different interests in participating such players in its club -
Spartan midfielder Rosický: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand rinsing fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický goes to the square.
The same scene as in Sunday's fight against the Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder moved the game against the Crusade Zvezda, he invented several goals, but his teammates did not go black.
The flight team, pumped with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, ends after the opening two-game in European cups.
Was it hard to do anything after Belgrade?
After the goal was taken four shots, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted not to lose, to raise our self-confidence, so that we should get away from something else.
We had a chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why didn't Sparta get into the game for so long?
The game is very processed.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get to do anything, we shot once in a half.
Of course, this is very little when you have to win two or three goals.
The second half was already much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you need to push your opponents more often into such positions.
Is the problem of a large number of changes in the report?
Of course, it is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We have only played three competitions and the line-up is still changing.
The point is that the coach finds the ideal eleven to sit down.
Is it encouraging you to have already played two consecutive games?
It's still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition will evolve and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have happened in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise we can't.
It's the same as the injury.
If you don't believe it, you can't come back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came back in large numbers, but they were embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, just like with Goddess.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show them something they'll come up for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember seeing this when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far we are fighting ourselves, we are playing, so this is not such an advantage to us.
For extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur has to sit down for ten years.
The Constitutional Court has rejected the complaint of entrepreneur Jiří Toman, who is expected to pay ten years in prison for tax cuts to a large extent.
The estimated damage is CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed that justice violated his fundamental rights, the facts of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were said to be incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Judges described the complaint as unfounded, the ČTK found out from the court database.
The U.S. is not another appeal court.
“It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess the factual or legal errors allegedly committed by the general courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms,” the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a refugee.
Verdict has been in jurisdiction since November 2015 when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in the release bond in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the decision of the U.S.A.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court described the case as an extreme tax evasion, which has a macro-economic impact on the state budget.
From 2005 to 2008, he served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Service.
The loss of CZK 645 million was created only during the period from January to July 2008, and the overall escape, according to the expert, exceeded one billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the whole amount.
According to the charges, World Service did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in just hundreds of thousands.
The World Service, as well as some companies that the company has traded, have a relationship with the entrepreneur Radomír Vybír, to whom justice has measured VAT for 13 years in prison for fuel trades.
He also rejected his complaint before the Constitutional Court.
\"A Summer to Survive\" and \"Comrade Detective\" series on the Nostalgic String
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both characters from the famous 1980s; and for the dirty 1990s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy sketch “The State”); and, of course, for modern times, namely 2001, before stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd sprang to larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and also an embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the point of view of the franchise, it looks like someone is breathing.
\"First Day of Camp - worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (an example can be the story of the emergence of a talking can with vegetables by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors moved away from the main funny points - middle-aged actors who play teen-bodied children - and they couldn't pull from previous events.
The sequel to \"Ten Years Later - in which adults play adults do not push so much on the emotional plane, and satir is places to sporadic, including parody on thrillers from the 1990s as \"Hand on the collar\"
At one point, the character finds on the pile of Apple Powerbook crash, roller skates and “a lot of other things from 1991”
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now the writer, has still not moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is inspired by George H. W. Bush (very well-occupied Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is many side stories.
Especially funny is watching the eternal young Rudd with long hair alias figure Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once respected figure Andy is now behind the old pepper.
Franchise could start moments of random madness, such as a more responsive series \"Seven Up - until it reaches what I assume will be logical resolution: \"Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,\" when in the last scene the whole group will embark on the premiere of \"A Summer to Survive\"
“Comrade Detective is appealing to another type of nostalgic on Amazon: Revivalism of the Cold War series “Such Normal Americans,” the film “Atomic Blonde: No Regrets,” and even the series “GLOW,” in which the icons of the Eastern and Western Wrestling scenes are clashing.
The comedy of creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania of the 1980s who are fighting for truth and atheism after Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregory and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, who have absolved into the English language Channing Tatum (the executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it is not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as police officers watching chess on television - parody of American football).
The series was given its voice by many famous actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
\"Comrade Detective - but he's too focused on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes the killer with Reagan's mask - and it looks like it too.
Six long episodes are too shy and comedic moments are not enough.
In a shorter trace, a propaganda satir could work in the “Comrade Detective”, such as in a scene where Gregory and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, where two fathogs swallow hamburgers stacked on a large pile.
The clear message for the imaginary Communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The inventive Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not expect the IAAF ban to be lifted.
The International Athletic Federation of the IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on start-up of Russian racers due to the state-backed doping program.
The vote in the World Championship, which will start on Friday, has been very clear as expected.
166 delegates voted to extend the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is the fact that Russia fails to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as stated before Congress, the head of the special investigation group IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspicious athletes have not yet been heard, and in the country still trainers work with a broken reputation.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not yet fully operational.
However, RUSADA is already able to carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
“Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done,” said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, among other things, the last year's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming MS, who have previously proven that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to start at the championship in national colours, and in case of victory they will not be able to play the Russian anthem.
Bank of England holds interest rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England should, as expected, announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following a non-obvious economic growth and a weakening of inflation that has stifled speculation about rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain “in the background, in the context of maintaining interest rates, despite spending family budgets.
The political officials of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) England's banks voted six to two to maintain the interest rate of 0.25%. The results of the vote at an increase in interest rates were supported by a lack of significant economic growth supported by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that a reduction in family budgets would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the Bank has indicated that there should be a rise in inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years, and it has also stated that motivating rents should increase in financial markets more than expected.
The committee members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy, and which was put into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the future financing plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should start to apply from February next, although the Bank of England said it would now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: “MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household income and consumption burdens.
On the subject of the bank’s tariffs, it will be necessary “to pull back the money policy bands to calm inflation,” “to a higher extent than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be “free” and “limited”
The bank has reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
The expected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the current state came after a more disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter versus 0.2% of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it should increase slightly by the end of the year.
The latest report on inflation is a small comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor pay increases. The bank said the situation would worsen before the rise.
The report further states that a monetary policy “can’t prevent income reductions in the coming years, but wages are expected to “significantly” rise to the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to the great interest in British goods due to a weak pound, which will compensate for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after last August’s rates were reduced to 0.025% in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that the total unification of prices and the economy will last for at least four years.
Prior to the bank’s decision at the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates, along with rising inflation, which was increasing pressure on households. Three policymakers demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
The inflation fell back to 2.6% from 2.9% last month, despite the fact that the bank said it expected such a change and that inflation should rise again next month.
The bank said that the relative overrun to 2% of the target was \"totally - as a result of a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Due to the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that the competition in the mortgage market will only rise as creditors start to compete for contracts with a view to a good outlook at the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing contracts and re-equity mortgages - there are options without fees, as well as low rates that they gain in popularity -
NHS prescribes controversial HIV treatment for 10,000 patients
Since September, patients will have access to ‘transformative’ HIV prevention treatments based on the Supreme Court’s decision on funding for NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) reported that the Pre-Exposure Profylaxis (PREP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through a health service to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the Court of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year with the statement that NHS had funds to pay for PrEP despite the statement that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
The decision, announced Thursday, adopted the NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “decisive moment”.
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to begin receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 there will be a full implementation across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV among at-risk patients.
Pre-sex application means that there is enough specific drugs in the patient’s body to prevent infection.
These drugs can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who sign consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also apply in their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will come to taxpayers for £10 million and NHS England signed a drug distribution contract this week after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully benefit from the ever-increasing and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It’s another milestone in more than thirty years of trying to stop one of the biggest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and at risk to patients, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, NSH has been offering patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and is not subject to the need to talk to a partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.”
Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The number one limit must be a rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure its availability to every patient.
“We now have a PrEP test drug and we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.”
Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and delay by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Following tests will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible across the country to protect those exposed to HIV and to end the spread of HIV in society.”
Life on a high foot: the mezzanine and smart design turned this small apartment into a Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment at Earls Cour.
Located on the first floor of Queen Anne's smart terrace - it is a prominent example of a modern design that uses for maximum space available.
“I lived with my ex-wife in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I came across this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height of the ceiling.
I fell in love with him, and that day I nodded at him.
Since then, an apartment of 1000 square meters of complete renovation has passed.
One-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage space and the mezzanine to use a high ceiling.
“I wanted a high ceiling, large windows and lots of light.
These were my requirements,” she said.
To this end, Erfan Azadi was employed by Duck & Shed, a design and design studio based in Notting Hill, and used a nearly four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights that there were two gaps above each other - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine at which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage in his creative thinking.
“The steel structure is quite complicated,” he explained.
“We had to organize both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but at the same time bend the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling -
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full rooms on himself - and at the same time add to the dramatic.
On the mezzanine, he looks at the beautiful living room of the old copper window frames in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance doors there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of a living room, which gives the whole apartment an impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen, if not used.
The folding kitchen is nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is a folding door.
“We had to solve the technical side,” says Erfan of the reinforced grated doors.
“The door is equipped with counterweights to be cut off very easily.
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage spaces, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
“When it comes to it, what you are selling is a residential area - or an appreciation of your property,” Erfan said.
“The real estate broker essentially calculates its price based on the residential area when entering the apartment.
In this case, we managed to increase the living area while maintaining the quality materials that lend the space a luxurious look.
“Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t love the power distributions in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your heart won't get -
As it turns out, quality design and increase of living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is breaking up.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has banned its citizens from travelling to Tennessee and other seven states.
The state of Tennessee paid her back and declared a retaliatory ban on travelling its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the fullest sense; U.S. citizens can travel freely across all fifty states.
California has banned state money from spending on its citizens’ journeys to eight other states, such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT, and any expression of disagreement with LGBT lifestyle is considered to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has passed a law on the reservation of conscience, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of patients from the LGBT community has no obligation to provide it to them, but is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who has no such problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws under which religious charities that have received children from mothers after birth to adoption have no obligation to provide these children with same-sex couples.
Due to these laws on the reservation of conscience, California has banned the financing of its citizens' journeys to eight states of the Union from its means.
In practice, this means that Californian professors must not have a trip to a scientific symposia, for example, in Texas, paid off from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
On the road they must obtain either federal grants, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the journeys of citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has been patient and its parliament has passed a resolution that it also does not like the California policy of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not impose a travel embargo on California.
He puts them as a revenge for the California Travel Embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen against any State of the Union which would order a similar travel ban on another State for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
The facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what it is not allowed to do.
Second, what is wrong with the conscience?
When a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why could he not only offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why would he be forced to sell pork under penalty when the pork cutters are enough?
In Colorado, one Baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
It also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or contains alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him in peace and order the cakes in the hundreds of bakeryes of others?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust domestic policies in powers that are not federal according to their preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California may be California and Texas may be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, LGBT community members once legitimately sought to tolerate their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and living, which should be guided by all reasonable people, but some activists seek not to tolerate themselves or others, but to have extreme intolerance to others.
According to them, no one can ever show moral, religious, or philosophical disapproval of LGBT lifestyles, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don’t know the situation in American history when the states did so, except in the case of one.
Even in times of struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where North and West were on the side of integration and South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was that of the 1950s, the political case was slavery, and the North war against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic states and the Red Republican states is deepening and the US is growing mentally internally.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critic Putin was fined.
Russia’s opposition politician Alexei Navalnyi was fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules before the presidential elections that will take place next year.
The court fined him for calling on people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalnyj has organized two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and announced that he wants to apply for the post of head of state in March next year.
President Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalnyj said the police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling people to protest through videos posted on the YouTube website.
Punishment is three hundred thousand.
“We’ll take them off the judge’s salary later,” Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian electoral commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of atrocities.
However, Navalny, who is considered a anti-corruption fighter, considers the relevant judgment politically motivated.
The fines of 300,000 rubles, and 25 thousand rubles, were also imposed by the court on Thursday by two members of the Naval Electoral Team, Leonida Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalnyj entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the broken opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in the campaign as much as possible.
In February, he was sentenced to five years of conditional punishment because of the theft of the Kirovles forestry company.
The Court of Appeal confirmed in May.
The judgment is so final, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of the empire, their Italian family stretches by one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides in Toorak, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has brought a dispute over joint property and commercial property to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly denied before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, she owns 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by a family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the Westco Jeans family was founded, which has grown into a chain with 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
For money, other properties have been purchased and the portfolio of the De Lutis family now includes offices, building land in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments at Gold Coast and Mt Buller and commercial centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company’s assets, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul’s words, is “an important driving force and dominant personality,” the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of its assets.
The court reports that Colin owns a property worth $316 million, while Paul manages properties for $176 million.
For Paul, the distribution of assets and funds has become problematic.
“Colin’s proposal sounded significantly in his favour in my eyes,” Paul wrote in a presiding statement to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first meeting of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also competing for who will control the existing business - from which Paul cut off according to his statement Colin.
Colin contradicts the fact that this is not true and accuses Paul of mistreatment of certain properties.
Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
“My Italian origin dictates that my family is the most important of all,” he wrote.
Hundreds of sites of pre-serious statements, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood lawyers, including Allana Myers, QC and both-party advocates.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had been operating dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and in the 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
They bought a property in Collingwood for the money earned by stopping the property, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in the last year of college, Paul was still a small, about a 10-year-old boy.”
Anna De Lutis said that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to sons would take place after good.
\"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court,\" she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family's group of companies, Colin said Mark was compensated for $10 million and Luke $26 million.
As Paul, Luke and Mark said, “they were not satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been holding back since then, despite the fact that he is a former board member of the AFL club, according to Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and best friend of Colin, in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin replied only through a text message stating that given the fact that the dispute is being resolved before the court, \"I have nothing to say -
“It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the whole case before the court,” he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin said in a statement to the court that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s demands.
“Our father would be very dissatisfied if he saw our current situation,” he said, adding, “that he is constantly hoping for a successful solution.”
On Friday all hopes were unsupervised.
“Our disputes will be resolved in the near future,” Colin wrote.
The heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers fascinate both water and summer clothes.
In the kindergarten Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, goes out only in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and planted trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There is no swimming pool, but teachers shower in the fog.
In the afternoon, children stay in classes where blinds are downloaded and curtains are covered.
Air tries to cool the air purifier because they do not have air conditioning.
It is also difficult for teachers and cooks.
“The temperature, which is both indoor and outdoor, exceeds the hygiene limits for kindergartens, so in this period we should not actually have open operation,” said Miloslava Makovičková, head of kindergarten.
In the kindergarten there is a glass corridor, where the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We wind up in the morning after 6 p.m., the windows close and we have on the southern sides of the blind that we protect ourselves.
\"But it won't help much,\" she added.
Better conditions have in the forest kindergarten Na Hrazi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have grown trees on the land, so we're under them.
“We have a beautiful nutmeg, there is a table below, and there we do different things,” said the head of the school Barbora Kompanová.
Teachers try to walk with their children in a forest where there is a bigger cold.
Children of wet hats and on the program have different games with water.
“We have a manual pressure sprayer that is used for flower sprays, and we use it to shower children,” Koman said.
Also, the director of kindergarten in Novoborska street at the Prague Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that the teachers are trying to keep the children in the shade and the drops are water.
“We have a fairly growing garden, so they’re under the trees,” she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a head cover.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they can choose a little sweetened tea or diluted juice, and in the garden they have drinking water.
Every day they eat vegetable salad and always fresh fruits and vegetables, which are sometimes brought to them by their parents.
“Today, one mother brought about a ten-kilometer for children,” Makovičková added.
Drivers receive water or summer uniforms.
The Prague DPP transport company provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
Cabins of tram and bus drivers are air conditioned in most cases, said DPP spokesman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to cabins, some trams are air-conditioned even in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks have not been seriously damaged yet.
Small damage occurred in the loop in Hostivař.
At current high temperatures, we make sure that enough drinks are available to the driver.
“Cold drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and roads,” Řehková said.
In the roadways and in some alternating places, employees have so-called so-called so-called so-called sodas, which produce cooled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble ion drinks.
“They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts,” the spokesperson added.
Hot and dry weather of the last days results in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the whole of the Czech Republic destroyed 108, twice the long-term average.
On Tuesday through the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic were climbing over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters mainly engaged in the fight against fire.
“They predominate fires in the natural environment as well as those linked to harvesting,” firefighter Nicole Zaoral said.
The firefighters also did not bring any weather change in the evening, when the storms and pruning rains replaced the heat in many places.
In connection with the storms, the firefighters went up to 236 interventions.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
“They were most affected in the Central Bohemian Region,” Zaoralová continues.
The firefighters also needed help in Stvolínky in the Czech Republic, where 60 people from the children’s camp were evacuated because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also added work to the rescuers in Prague.
On Tuesday and Wednesday morning, ambulances went out to ten cases of carbon-fired oxide poisoning.
Therefore, people should have their water heaters checked, warn the rescuers.
Carbon dioxide is a colorless gas without odor, which is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infested room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit President's media diet
Many have tried before him and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico said the new White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of President Trump's information - including TV news reports - in the hope of keeping Trump on the surface.
Here's a part of Josh Dawseye's report:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met on the first day in a new position with his employees, he outlined the key problem of the Trump White House, which plans to correct: the wrong information that gets the president in his hands.
Kelly told employees he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or speaking word - because the president could better decide on the basis of the right information -
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have broken their teeth to control Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
“If Trump, as a candidate, was upset with honest reports, it was appropriate to show him that a lot of other media were talking about him in positive light, which was easier to convince,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets in check, at least according to the words of six former campaign organizers, is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that praise him.”
All right.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something others don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more outraged if someone didn't control them.
We will never know about the tweets Trump has never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least several times, then their efforts did not come out.
However, no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from inciting controversial topics.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by undermining Trump’s materials - which they can but may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the tendency of advisers to submit dubious information to the head of state in May.
This is an example of such information from the pen of the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“The current and former Trump officials say the president often reacts very angryly to negative news from the media, especially the news of leaks, and seeks to find their origins.
This situation occurred at the end of February, when someone pushed a copy of the article from GotNews.com, the website of the provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the “source of many leaks of information” from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was forever convicted of harassment on Twitter; or that he had not filed his claims with any evidence; or that he had already published false charges in the past and later revoked them.
Trump has read the article and started asking about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter \"were trying to implement the system to manage and documentation the information that President Trump receives -
Would it work?
Kelly is now trying to implement the same strategy three months later.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsiveness will not go away and his assistants are still competing for power.
These immutable factors of Kelly's mission will certainly make it difficult.
Tourists Negotiate for a Bitcoin and Return to ‘Millionaire Quarter’
Several of the most powerful homeowners in the English county of West Midland are re-entering with dedicated tourists who negotiate with local authorities on the right to regain their land for their residences.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in the field by a flourishing street in the city of Solihull, which is called the “millionaire quarter”.
Bringing horses, children and army of caravans, tourists return after they were declared in May. They were not afraid of the excavation, which was excavated on the site by regulations of the authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
The tactful group found gaps in defense and penetrated into the field with the caravans unprotected gap that served the way.
Rising residents of the district attacked the administrative board of the city of Solihull with the fact that it was “not able to solve the problem”.
One of the residents who wanted to remain anonymous said: “They occupied the place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath, where they threw stones around other people.
The Management Board should be ashamed of its inability to resolve the problem.
All tourists were moved to another place and now they are back.
There were others coming last night, and there’s probably even more coming today.”
She added: 'Birmingham Board knows how to deal with this problem. To protect the parks, she uses court orders.
I live in Streetsbrook and don’t want to pay taxes until the board of directors deals with tourists.”
Another anonymous resident said, “It’s ridiculous. Just recently we’ve been watching the last outgoing tourists and now they’re back.
And this time there are more of them, and this time they brought their horses with them.”
A press spokesman for Solihull’s board of directors said: “We are aware of an unauthorized stay on the plot near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem in a timely manner.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any non-social or illegal behaviour to the police at 101.
We'll get the whole picture we're going to bring to court.\"
The European Parliament's husband crashed a car in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special delivered the injured Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under the constant control of Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-term flight was gone without complications.
Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of summer.
He's been hit by a car and he's been in serious condition ever since.
After transport to the country, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanský from NOVA.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italians Retain In Fight Against NGO Rescue Ships With Immigrants On Board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving at Italy's coast with migrants from the Mediterranean if NGOs fail to sign new rules governing their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to show that they could continue their operations,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin Daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Reettet due to suspicions of trafficking in human beings, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which operates for the first year, refused to comment on the matter because of the allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
“It is and always will be the number one priority to save human lives, so we are very sorry that we can’t operate in life-saving zones at the moment,” the organization said in a statement.
“We can only comment on all the charges at the moment after the gathering of all the information and assessment of the whole situation,” he said.
Italian authorities have been following the Iuventa ship of Jugend Reettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of carrying immigrants who were handed directly to them by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting occurred according to the applicant's file, reportedly only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya.
The crew of the ship is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian coast guard, who oversees rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
Last Thursday, the organization said that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, as they do not constitute any \"substantial change or obstacle\" in terms of rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct, for example, was rejected by the organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which holds the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minniti has been told that the sharp decline in immigrants in Italy’s rescue operations in recent weeks suggests that efforts to strengthen the coast of Libya’s patrols and cooperate with local mayors bear fruit.
“In recent days, we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations to take place this month with the Mayors of Libya on economic development initiatives, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali regarding measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Mesaroshi: She was found by silicone and cellulite.
Hot summer days are all about taking on only the most necessary things to cover up the most intimate parties.
Just Dominik Mesarošová does the opposite.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, moderators, singers and all that they have to do with TV Prima, she just slid, her body shrouded into a mini-overal.
And just a few ordinary movements and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her back.
He looked at her as many times as he had to cut her in half, and she was so high that she had to change it all the time.
The attention of the masters and the photographers present was not so much in need.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Sending Text Messages To Suicide by Conrad Roy
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to liberty for two years for inciting her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
20-year-old Michelle Carter takes 15 months from a two-year-old prison sentence and then spends five years in conditional release.
Carter was sentenced in June for the inadvertent killing of Conrad Roy, who married his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said in court on Thursday: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend.
Carter was left free until the decision.
She was threatened with up to 20 years of imprisonment, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and creamy blouses, Carter stood in declaring a judgment on the spot with tears in her eyes, with her arms and eyes pointing to the ground.
“His actions killed Conrad Roy,” the judge said.
“She ended his life to relieve herself.
She couldn’t accept her own responsibility, she said.
\"She showed no regrets -
However, Carter’s attorney said these were “unlucky circumstances he regrettably regrettable.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “its age or level of maturity, or even mental disorder, has no significant impact on her actions.”
The defendant read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “It’s not going to run out of time, so I can’t shake over the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain we will bring with us forever,\" the statement said.
Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was “persecuting” - knowing she would never attend his brother’s wedding and would never be his children’s aunt.
“The loss of the person I’ve seen since I was born is the pain I’ll bear for my lifetime,” she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would affect the person helping to kill the other person.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after a text message was published by Carter, which sparked suicide.
“I don’t care if I have to hang out, jump out of a building, or stab me,” Carter wrote in a text message just two weeks before he died when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote to him, “You have to do it to Conrad,” and “It’s enough to just throw a generator and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people on Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British grandfather in Italy in 2007, two years ago she was released from charges.
Ms. Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.
Audi adjusts up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the announcement of the Audi car manufacturer, BMW said it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW’s president said the company believes that “there are more smart options than driving restrictions, in response to European cities, including Munich, which is headquartered in BMW, which is considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted largely the use of diesel atuomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the CO2 emissions regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide that discharges diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of automakers is increased for the installation of the equipment to neutralize the gases issued by diesel engines, which makes it more difficult for cars to compete.
While German car manufacturers face careful searches, Chancellor Angela Merkel is accused of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen errors, which in order to meet emission limits installed software in their cars, which reduced the amount of emissions released during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been charged in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the engine development department in Audi would be arrested in Germany.
Former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian nationality and therefore does not apply to extradition, so he may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation by the German automaker Volkswagen police after authorities accused Audi of installing a system that would bypass the European emission limits, extending the allegations that Audi faces in the US.
Audi’s inclusion in the investigation may have a detrimental impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers make up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane landed on the beach.
The man and the girls died.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the TV channel SIC Noticias said the plane flew just above the people on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach reportedly fled from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach according to local media.
“The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot,” said local police chief Pedro Coleho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, they both got out of the accident alive, and the police took them away for an interview.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are highways possible in the Czech Republic?
I'll give you a puzzle.
It is not completed, even though it began to be built in 1978.
Even if it is not completed, it is constantly being corrected.
And it can't be built, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the D11 motorway.
The construction of the next section of the project has been halted for at least a few months by the movement of the Children of the Earth.
We Eastern Czechs get a highway in pieces, like when salami is cut.
They'll cut the wheel, and then they'll see when and if we get any more.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We only want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or Poland from villages and cities.
The endless currents of trucks go directly through the cities of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not like a rational orbit.
However, the last section of our dream highway was set up in 2008, i.e. nine incredible years ago.
Since then, no stick.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of the unfinished section to Hradec Kralove began to be built recently, and in the next sections to Jaroměra, an archaeological survey began with the fact that the construction began at the end of this year, you could hear a loud banging of spouts in eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out not to be building this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has decomposed.
The children of the Earth repeat their D1 tactics.
They attacked the decision on the building permit in its entirety.
In the decomposition, they shall require a review of all already issued binding opinions of all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Castle Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Office.
So far, we are leaving D11 near a village called Funeral.
So we're going down, we're just going on the highway, and suddenly we're standing on the side road, and we're giving priority to then join the column.
The worst part is that you see similar stories throughout the country.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benesov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has a funeral.
What do the children of the earth demand?
What is the essence of the problems of construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually incomplete in the existing system?
Read the new reflex.
Provence’s Lavender Threatens Climate Change
Lavenders have become a symbol of Provence in the area of south-eastern France, but now they are at risk of climate change.
Lavender falls due to dry climates and harmful insects, causing fear on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The growth of lavender in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it fewer precipitation in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
It is also the fault of gypsies and microbacteria-carriers that thrive in a dry climate.
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and oil produced from them is an important ingredient of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “A place of long and beautiful flowers grows smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
Of course, the amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is less.
A possible solution can be to more efficiently distribute water and slow the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spray lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of journalists highlights growing threats in Mexico
Riodace employees meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the unrests that take place in the Sinaloa area, involving organised criminals, corrupt officials and non-stop drug wars.
Today, however, it is mainly due to its own security.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two deserving journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that someone attacked in 2009 with a grenade or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to each word - no evidence is needed, it is enough to use imagination and pretense.
Choose them from - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover criminal behavior.
The violence does not stop and the bodies rise across the country; journalists are constantly growing among them: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 of them have been in power since President Enrique Pen Niet's arrival in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven states this year seven have been killed.
Among them, co-founder of Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence associated with drug trafficking.
His loss is sensitive, although his presence is omniscent - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription \"Justice - on which the middleman shows, hangs on the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miranda Ramirez - over the age of 30, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on the face, glasses on the nose, and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the establishment of a special federal prosecutor's office in 2010 to address cases of journalists, two suspects have been sued by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime.
Journalists from Riodace insist on informing them of the violence that is taking place in Sinaloe; even though they are destroyed by grief and that territory is currently very deceiving.
“Without information about the invaders and without the vision of justice, the safety meeting is inconclusive,” Ibarra says.
“It is foolish to waste time on such meetings,” he adds.
“If we don’t get more information, we can’t trust anyone.”
In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodace in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to run several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 bullets, apparently due to the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelveth river.
The shooters then entered his car and attacked him near the scene of the crime.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind his wife and two adult children.
It seems that in Culiacanu the rumors are spreading rapidly.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since last year's arrest of Guzman and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloody battlefields, as the rival faction tries to fill an empty place.
Every day several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “moderate” means that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel to the United States of drugs.
However, as well as the fact that Valdez has been familiar with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodace, continues to defend his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damascus Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that led the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzman.
Reconciliation could upset the sons; the suspected gang members bought all copies of the papers at the time they landed on the countertops.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and is seen as an important milestone in the fight against journalists by Mexican criminals.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the journal Noroeste, he was practically veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and start together with five colleagues of Riodace.
In Sinaloe, “it was impossible to run a journalist and not mention the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
In time, Riodace gained a good reputation for brave and true news; the newspapers began to thrive.
Journalists liked to go into a search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodace won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for the reportage of Latin America.
The same year, Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its brave reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez admitted openly that he was afraid.
“I was worried about my life,” he said.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is “a way of life,” Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
\"You have to take on the role of a journalist - or play stupid.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What did you do in the face of death... why didn’t you say what was going on?’
Riodace's employees miss Valdez. The man was known for his joke and unelected language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone was relying on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: has this routine caused his death?
His death in them also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
“They don’t like it when you get involved with their wives, their children, clean shops, secret landing areas,” he said.
“These things were forbidden,” Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something is not playing here, your hands are gone.
The problem is, Riodace editor Andres Villarreal said, “The sense that can be deluded... and then the thing with Javier happened.”
The old rules, like others, no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggler paths, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The country is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodace employees meet, no mobile phones are allowed; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief in front of a 40-degree bucket in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodace, which are located in a four-storey building in the town district of Culiacan.
Journalists are concerned that these police officers are not among those 50 percent of the guardians of the law, who, according to government statements, are corrupt.
It’s been a few months since journalists last set out in mountainous areas that basically control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julius Césara Chavez in Sinaloa.
They are also enlightened for suspicious government spending that took place in the hometown of the governor of the state.
Recently there have also been several kidnappings at one of the most luxurious restaurants in Culiacán, just a block from the office of the prosecutor.
Officially, no one announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were careful when they were about to write about what every city citizen knows: that the restaurant is a favorite destination of drug traffickers and politicians.
One journalist explained from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name, which is associated with a certain politician, who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene of almost the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in high posts.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about the previous incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín’s sons “El Chapo-Guzmana escaped an army intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would read about this topic in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
“Valdez would certainly be able to decipher the case,” said Villarreal (46), who is called “El Flaco” for his slim figure.
\"Now all the informers turned their backs on us.
Valdez's office turned into a storehouse of signs and stickers for protests against the killing of journalists, and the staff certainly did not expect to become activists in the representation of the press.
A journalist, Miriam Ramirez, took several signages and set out to demonstrate in front of the state prosecutor's office next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared only three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a burning body was discovered, according to the authorities, it is based on a DNA analysis of Adamea.
The activity of journalists is increasing throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and glaring on the pavements and buildings of the \"SOS print\"
The head of the Bojorquez newspaper is on a visit to Washington, where he tries to gain international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who took place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of following journalists and killing them for proclaiming the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked for a transfer to another department because of the fear that her anger could threaten her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are “circumcised” by organised crime, corrupt officials and the indifferent public.
In his latest book, “Narco-Journalism,” he wrote that journalists are dying not only by the hands of drug cartels, but also by ordering politicians and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The media surveillance group Articulo 19 accused more than half of all attacks on police journalists and public officials.
“You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you,” Ramirez said.
The murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who took place six years ago at the northern borders of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message that was reportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: \"This is how I ended up because of my messages -
Next to the cut-off heads lay the keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to end their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper based at the northern border of the state of Chichewa in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breach.
Others continue, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing his director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed a public drug cartel article on the opening page titled “What You Want From Us”
Some journalists fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that you are constantly being persecuted.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, such as Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, every day poses a great risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is heading to hell, so I became a journalist,” he said.
It is Friday midnight and Riodace employees sit on the pavement in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when it suddenly starts to ring the phone.
They learn that 19 people died while shooting between gang members and police officers near the beach resort in the city of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, exactly as many messages left in this area by the members of the Syndicate promised.
Journalists publish this news from their mobile phone on the Riodace website.
Not a single day will run out, and the opening title will change again.
The sounds of police sirens show another shot.
Bojorquez throws a quick look at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they are afraid, they do not show it.
Under a huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middleman is an excuse slogan for the whole of Sinaloe - all Riodace employees follow his steps.
“As if we could think of leaving,” Bojorquez said, “when on the same day that Javier was killed, one internist asked me to send her to the streets.”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
The researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first findings of an amazing creature about the size of the rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called the 'Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs' - found a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that the experts were able to determine the red-brown color of his sculpted skin and stated that the dinosaur had a “problem past”.
The article in Current Biology said it was “the most preserved ever found armored dinosaur and one of the best species of dinosaurs in the world.”
The fossil is a new species of the family of Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the period of Cretaceous, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition was literally shocked by the researchers who described him with the words ‘really remarkable’.
According to National Geographic, the armored white man is the best-preserved fossil of his kind.
Behind the finding is Shawn Funk, who revealed fossils on March 21, 2011, while drilling down Suncor Millenium near Alberta, Canada.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on discovering an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After the work is done, the dinosaur is ready to be revealed.
“It’s enough to turn your eyes a little bit, and you’ll believe he’s sleeping,” said the head of the work, regards the Royal Tyrrell Museum’s naturalist, Caleb Brown, where the animal is exposed.
“It will certainly be written in history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaurs, Mona Lisa Dinosaurs.
By studying his skin, researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered with armor and resembling a walking tank - was likely to face a serious threat from carnivore dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system that uses many of today’s animals.
Experts claim that this allowed him to better blend with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests that he was a popular food of larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old dinosaur family of Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspaper in May. Currently, it is available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named him Borealopelta Markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team careful discovery of the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document the patterns and shape of the scales and armor throughout the body.
They discovered a masking method commonly used by today’s animals to defend - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising because Borealopelta’s size far exceeds today’s animals using the same technique.
Thus, it is possible that the dinosaur was such a number of predators that evolution preferred masking over confrontation in survival.
Many modern animals with masking - such as deer, zebra and/or stripe - are much smaller and also more vulnerable than prey, indicating that nosodaurus had to fight for his surviving literally.
“The sale of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur clearly illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the time of the Cretaceous,” Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaurs of the skin were likely to have red-brown coloration.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for more information about his life, including preserved stomach content, to find his last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after his death and was taken to the sea, where he sank to the bottom.
At the time, Alberta was the same climate as in today’s Florida, and rivers and oceans were moving much further inland than they are today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in the fact that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while being preserved in three dimensions, so that we can see its original size,” Brown said.
For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as at the time of the Cretaceous.
You don’t have to use your imagination to rebuild it; you just need to make your eyes look a little hot and it seems like you’re just sleeping.”
During the time of the Cretaceous, giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, were walking around the Earth, moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived several million years after Boreapelta, this armored dinosaur could have been the favorite prey of his equally terrible ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5-meter-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in Current Biology magazine, believe that the Borealopelt's body was spilled into the sea after it was mummified in mud.
Behind the finding is Shawn Funk, who revealed fossils on March 21, 2011, while drilling down Suncor Millenium near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from the jaw to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
His shoulders were two 50 cm tall.
The researchers believe that this herbivore has stagnated the territory of Canada today until it ended up in a river that spilled it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil residues of this kind are also preserved to the extent that armored slices around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote about the National Geographic Wrote, “the finding of such a preserved individual can be compared to the lottery win.
The longer I watch him, the shocking the finding seems to me.
Fossil residues of this kind are also preserved to the extent that armored slices around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
On his side lies his right front foot with his fingers pointing up.
I can easily count the scales on his feet.”
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: “Whose Streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook across the body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a native from St. Louis sat on a bed in the Airbnb room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a high school student’s contribution.
“The police have just shot an 18-year-old young man whose body is still on the street,” he said.
She was surprised that no one else had written this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
@TheePharoah constantly retweeted her posts on the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis tweeted about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man who was shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body, lying on the street, where no one took it after four hours.
“That’s crazy,” Ferrell thought.
Death was nothing new to her and her community.
She postponed the phone to return to him in the evening, watching tweets about people gathered on Canfield Drive.
She watched photos of police tapes and screaming people. One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign in his hand with the inscription \"Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son -!
She watched live news - one of the police officers stood before a group of protesters, holding a lead and at the other end of a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer held, as she said, in the hand of a weapon with which he aimed at the crowd and shouted, “I will kill you all... the animals.”
“That’s not normal,” Ferrell said.
“This isn’t the kind of murder we’re used to and we can call normal.
I felt thick skin all over my body.
“I was angry and I was crying.
She immediately ordered a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes a new documentary, “Whose Streets,” which will be introduced into the cinemas of August 11th.
It is a story about survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and integrity told from the perspective of people living in the community who go to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral dressing and the same flower forehead - about the topic they had previously discussed many times - \"on the experience of blacks -
“You remember how I taught you how the boys had to fight for what they believed in,” he said.
\"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old young man and that's not right.
“It didn’t seem to me to take it with me,” Ferrell said later.
“Today’s events are the culmination... which occurred in the past.
She had to know and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between different layers of experience with blacks and what we had to do to free ourselves.
Even though I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own skin, she does not differ in any way from another black woman.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her.
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop of the South Florissant Road was opposite the police department, which became the base of activists who expected the words of police officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here Ferrell met her daughter with a local entrepreneur who was preparing for other food.
Together, they prepared food for the bags and helped them spread it to the Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, a new type of activism began to be born slowly.
“My activism turned upside down after 9 August,” Ferrell said, adding that she was president of Minority Student Nurses Assn when she studied at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural -
A few weeks later, Ferrell met later co-director Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to “only document the ongoing events.
Ferrell said, “You’re working on a document or trying to find a story that could be used.
Such a type of scepticism penetrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to make money on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We have heard that the voices of people born and growing up in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that,” she said.
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a recognized local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners in the whole of death.
Ferrell was also involved in the project, along with six other locals who followed the \"Whose Streets\" team in the years following Brown's murder.
“No one speaks for us in this document, but it’s our murder,” Davis said.
\"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented -
While the aim of the document was not to focus on the experiences of Ferrell - in an attempt to show that the movement \"is not about the salvation leader, but about the community's approach,\" Folayan said - it turned out that she is the most open to participation in filming.
\"Whose Streets\" describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said with a smile on her face when thinking about the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
“But I understood that in order to do this work and to ply the blacks, I must open up,” he said.
In addition, Ferrell’s story highlights the role of an eccentric black woman in the wider aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaigns under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves weirdes.
“The black eccentric women in leading positions are ultimately worth maintaining the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must endure the burden of these events.
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that \"the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women -
However, he insists that “this is not a mere affirmative matter, and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her views.
“It was she who was the power and source of energy,” she said.
\"that she was in the front lines is not a coincidence, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You feel the energy in front of the screen.
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the cameras of television stations have cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell has a two-and-a-half-year condition for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
The social political atmosphere in the area that she calls home described as “the mess”
However, she has not continued her efforts, which she has been committed to since she went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we can lose is our chains.
A field burned in Cologne.
Tens of firefighters went to the site, and the helicopter helped.
Near the Czech Brod in Cologne, between the villages of Bolany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares was burned from 2 p.m.
Fire stopped spreading around 15:15, firefighters declared the third stage of fire alarm from four possible.
According to the firefighter Ladislav Holomčík, fire from the air helped fire the helicopter.
At 18:00 firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage for 700000 crowns.
Tens of professional and voluntary firefighters fought on the spot.
The fire occurred due to a technical defect in the engine compartment of the combine.
Hasit also helped the helicopter, which carried out six water strikes in total.
“We have handed over the place of intervention to the owner until 8 p.m. tomorrow, he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters,” said Holomčík.
A Being Resemblance: Artist Creates Portraits Using DNA Chelsea Manning
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery, several faces of different shades of skin are placed - white, black and brown - suspended from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them as if they fell out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral and hair wipes sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unwarranted release of secret cablegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2, bears the name Acoming Resemblance.
She is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, informatics and art, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence Obama reduced three days before leaving the post of President of the United States.
An algorithmic DNA analysis by Manning and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genome would look like, created Dewey-Hagborg's sharp, if not intellectual commentary on DNA subjectivity - as well as on many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being considered a woman since she was young. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of 20 charges, including violations of six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were held by prison staff. Only one black-and-white photo escaped in lower quality, on which Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in a platinum-blonde pair, which she is now associated with.
In 2015, a positive reaction to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project was still received by Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items - such as cigarette and chewing gums - to create an image of possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They were planning an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and they wanted to complete the article with a portrait,” Dewey-Hagborg explained on the opening of a new exhibition.
Visits and photographs were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea if she was interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her incarcerated muse have been cunning in two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoila Kanung, who presented the vision of what would have happened if Chelsea had been pardoned and could take part in the exhibition personally.
President Obama actually asked for Manning’s release a few days after the release of the comic book, which was a welcome change after several intolerable years spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It is really interesting that the exhibition takes place at the time when Donald Trump wages war with people who seek to disclose government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to stimulate their tweets in areas he should support.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “everything is happening for some reason.
Under the artist’s statement on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter “i-in the last name is flown with the heart) after the end of a self-perpetuating fraternity based on sex, race, sexuality and culture.
On the opposite side are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a stack of letters C, G and A recorded by a pencil.
With 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to a sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
“I hope people get rid of it, that our genome doesn’t matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
“DNA tells a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them.”
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the above graphic novel.
He depicts Manning, who emerges in the way of King Kong from the United States Disiplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
“As soon as they have prevented you from speaking, they will win,” he said.
“Never let yourself be silenced.”
“It’s a direct transcript from one of the letters,” the Philadelphia artist said.
“When I think about it, my skin pops up.
Manning has not yet visited the exhibition in person - which was predicted in a comic book - but when it happens, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room with its masks, its own genomic features, arranged as a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including a nearly 160 cm high statue of Maning, on which its genetic Haplosgroup is recorded by pencils.
“In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to create the impression of mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and frees it,” he said.
Northwestern University Professor and Employee of Oxford University Seeking for Murder
On these days, a nationwide search is being conducted for Professor Northwest University and Oxford University staff who are being prosecuted for suspecting the murder of a man who was found to die in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, a first-degree arrest warrant was issued to a man named Wyndham Lath (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the Cook County court file.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from the consequences of several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
Police officers were informed by phone about this. When they arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the scene, and detectives investigate the case as a murder. Meanwhile, the police are searching for both suspects, the authorities said.
Lathem has been a professor in microbiology and immunology since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of the University of Public Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university’s school premises.
“The whole case is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the North-West University is working fully with them,” Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an email: “The British police contacted us and we are ready to assist the U.S. police as well.
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the fact and wish he would apply to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations with the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling on suspects to give up to the competent authorities.
“Police have information about their place of residence and the search for suspects is increasing,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, which was warned of the events that would occur in the apartment No. 1008.
The police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lath and Warren were captured by security cameras.
“We believe Professor Latham knew his victim,” Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza’s management has issued a statement to all residents: “Police is now working on compiling a timesheet and victim profile and investigating various motives, including domestic violence.
“In the near future, we will complete the plan of WADA - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mutko
Russian Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“At present, part of the criteria of the new plan has been completed and RUSADA has already gained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan was updated,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The vice-president commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of the validity of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutek, the code has nothing to worry about Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned above calls for a public announcement of the WADA investigation conducted by Richard McLaren about the alleged sponsorship of the doping of Russian athletes by the government.
Mutko said: “We are conducting investigations because our anti-doping system obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, so we cannot admit something that never existed.
Mutkova’s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with the Russian RSport Smirnov, he admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but added: “On many occasions, we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the message without reservation,” Smirnov said.
WADA suspected RUSADU of carrying out doping checks within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
After visiting the Moscow headquarters of the organization in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said that RUSADADA is “on the right track” to restore validity.
The police accused three people, one young.
Police accused three men of setting up a Wednesday fire for a rare wooden church in Třince-Gutech on Frýdecko-Mieteck.
One accused is young, all three are Czech nationalities.
Up to 15 years of imprisonment are at risk for a criminal offence.
This is what the Moravian-Silesian police director Tomáš Kuzel told journalists today.
He said it was a deliberate crime.
“It’s a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter,” said Kuzel.
He said the police would be able to take the accused into custody.
Further information, according to the Director, cannot be disclosed.
“I can’t say anything yet, because the police and investigation services and the public prosecutor who oversees the matter are actually working on things,” said Kuzel.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage will go according to preliminary estimates to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
After the fire, the restoration of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, additional costs are planned to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine of the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabov also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
This caused a failure to electrically install.
Then there was an exact copy of it.
The state counts with citizens in defense of the state.
They will support their training.
With financial support for associations that are applicable to the defence of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the substantive intention of the Act on the preparedness of citizens to defend the state is to be calculated.
The Ministry of Defense, which has been tasked with its processing by the government, promises to increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
This is based on a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns in support of the defense.
The main objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help increase the preparedness of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic to defend the state, beyond the exercise of the responsibilities of the goal and on the basis of voluntaryness.
For example, the State would be financially or materially supporting associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would allow it to increase the ability of its members.
In return, he would receive data on people who are willing to come to the country when needed during the crisis to assist, and on their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to help companies and other stakeholders in training or education.
It also counts on organizing talks with war veterans or people who behaved heroically.
One of the possible options assumes that a new office would be created, which would be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that participation of people should be voluntary and that the state would use their capabilities only after the declaration of the state of threat.
“The whole concept must respect the gradual shaming of previously obvious borders between different types of threats,” he said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials have noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just those of the military.
“The main objective of the plan is to create a very wide base that enables every citizen to respond to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and to the wrong conduct of not hindering the performance of tasks by the armed forces of the Czech Republic,” he said.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial claims.
According to the Ministry, their level will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office assumes financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns a year.
More money would be spent on salaries or building an information system.
The proposal also assumes that it would have to expand the scope of the Regional Military Command, which would employ 42 more soldiers together.
Representatives of the Ministry have previously stated that the law should also help resolve the disapproval of some Czech politicians with the introduction of a European Union directive on arms possession.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons the directive warrants.
Startups That Will Help Your Company Not Become Another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but she did not find an adequate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even deceptive.
And even though she promised the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust in the entire process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, the owner of the haircare company Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
He asked for help from outside.
New startups from the human resources industry are constantly emerging on the market, helping companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with a specific intention to measure employee responsibilities, startups enable companies to make quick votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, and also offer complete employee anonymity and a hot line for filing complaints, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass and contact managers directly.
“There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where Fitbit is for your company,” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint, a startup based in Reedwood City.
Errett said she gained more awareness of what her employees think and feel in three years.
In addition to the quick surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a consistent overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers - which allows the user to work on a remedy.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to pay attention to the culture of the working environment - in the event that they would become another Uber - which is confused in the scandals after a former employee posted a post on his blog describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Converter of Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandal.
Almost 600 convert clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has also adopted its wings.
Similar to Glint, Converter allows companies to send customisable “light-based” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous textual hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director General is involved in the problem, the complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
“The Court of Justice has authorised regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the start-up of the Convertent.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behavior - and if regulators do not act - it may face costly consequences as a result of a boycott of customers, exhaustion of employees or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
Ruby Tuesday’s restaurant network, employing over 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses Convertercent for more than a year to raise employee awareness of corporate policies and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to look for a phone number or email on the management of the company, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general representative, who said there was no reliable way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convertent, it ensures rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never been reached by managers, sitting in offices, miles away from a real solution to complaints - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment.
“This is closer to a holistic, overall view of employee experience,” said Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
“At the same time, we protect shareholders from court disputes by employees -
Companies stopped taking ethics, values, and employee participation in light weight in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron’s fall on employee ethical rights abuse, Quinlan said.
But it was only when “the social media was illuminated for the whole thing,” that companies began to realize that they couldn’t simply hide their skeletons in the closet in the online world.
“Before people started using technology to track ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by bold capital investors, who supported both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Konvercent selected $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and eventually took out $47 million.
Glint won $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and won $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising due to the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of research shows clearly that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main advantage of high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to see that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to the company that seeks a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they see their voice being heard, and that their work is rewarding, they seek the success of society,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money when companies and companies thrive when their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment towards the company, it is no wonder that there will be a lot of investors who will support this effort.
According to experts in working culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can provoke disappointment and lack of interest of employees.
“As soon as you ask for 4,000 views, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who witnessed many companies that rely too much on the data itself.
“Because once you don’t get things done, employees start asking themselves, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should it interest me?”
Madison Reed, who conducts a survey between employees on a regular basis, can solve the problem within one day thanks to Glint.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start training communication to solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday has a very important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the industry in the long term, known for its frequent redundancies.
“If you don’t try to create a transparent working environment, employees won’t trust you,” Vitrano added.
“And once you start losing your employees, you lose your customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes down -
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic, with 38.3 degrees recorded in the Watch Tower in Hodonín.
It was the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records.
Vedra mainly hit Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records of 35 out of 145 meteorological stations measured for over 30 years were settled.
It recorded a record of only nine long-term measuring stations on Thursday.
The temperature of today was the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednica, Břeclavsk today, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four-tenths of the degree and in Pohořelice in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records came from 2013 as well.
The high temperatures appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watch Tower, the largest heat in Dyjákovice, Znojmsko and Broda was above Dyji in Břeclavsk, where mercury leveled to 37.8 degrees, but did not exceed the record.
On the other hand, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, according to the Czech Republic, today’s highest temperature was only about 22 degrees Celsius.
“The temperatures started to rise there only later this afternoon,” the meteorologists said.
The current heat sinks in the Czech Republic will gradually resonate, and there could also be more significant rain on Sunday.
However, in most areas of Moravia there will remain high temperatures on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia and Saturday.
We've got such a mess out here.
It is not enough for billionaires to have the same vote in elections as for every adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as rude as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, buy political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva together with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč sponsors Robejška Realisty.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the entrepreneur in the realities of Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of the party.
The convicted corrupt and king of the Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, took over the Party of Privaters.
The political movement of Agrofert, as the project by Andrej Babiš, was named by the pro-Rzežský mayor Jaroslav German, is a chapter for itself.
The mayors recently caught their billionaires.
It is Dalibor Grandpa, the owner of the Jablotron security device.
According to his own words, he enters into politics to do good.
Entrée in the mayor's shirt, however, failed his grandfather very much.
“I’ve never had small goals,” he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the YES movement to win 20 percent in the elections.
Leckdo laughed.
My grandfather’s death is more of a sign.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of firm opinion.
Although she intends to apply for the vote of the mayors in the dress, she continues to support Andrei Babiš.
Grandmother has supported the last parliamentary elections.
“Babisz is not a sharp speaker and he does not rule with the kissy rhetoric of political snakes,” he wrote before the 2013 election.
He is definitely not in politics because he wants to improve himself.
Babish will remain a hero for me.
He is willing to step out of his world under control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he became admired by Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn how to work with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change her mind and is behind her no matter what dress she wears.
Others can speculate whether Babiš sends to the Mayors to build his bee to someone so clumsy.
Others may ask if the head of Jablotron, for example, did not break up with Agrofert’s boss in a bad store and was not looking for any other way to defend his business rival.
The first Grandparent's performance was not just about Grandma.
Grandpa promised the Mayors to send ten million crowns to the campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been difficult for anyone to pause on a similar statement.
In 2010, Zdenek Bakala, a well-recognized gaunner, cast millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Vita Bárta, TOP 09 and civil Democrats came together for almost 30 million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
When Grandpa entered politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe you don't have to ask yourself why politics has such a bad reputation.
He then crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for tax benefits for families with children studied.
People with higher education will come to about 50,000 per month.
The ones with the basics of less than 20.
A man with 50,000 is rich in the circumstances here.
The one with twenty poor.
In Grandpa’s vision, the poor pay taxes honestly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the social state in which they do not participate much.
The rich need to be helped not to suffer poverty with need.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisitions and Babiš can have his hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question remains who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have members and members of their party or citizens and citizens of the state for their employees and the country for their property.
And in the end, those who want to live well in a rich country to all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump’s paradise.
The villa complex had to be discounted by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And many times it won’t be able to use 11 bedrooms, a wonderful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down for an incredible £8 million.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The booklet says about the plot: ‘With greetings, Donald J. Trump’
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the connection of real estate companies with the US president did not defend the extreme price list.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean headquarters by an incredible £8 million.
The original price of the property was 21.5 million pounds, the final price dropped to 13 million pounds.
Even after a discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The breathtaking five-acre residence on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Tens of palm trees are planted on the plot.
From the terrace there is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed that the connection with the president is not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal prices of properties on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to the speculation, he paid around 15 million pounds.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
However, with the new price, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at £13.5 million.
NCAA has decided to end two trainings a day. For Bruins, long days are coming
The 11th morning is approaching, and players at UCLA University’s American Football University are walking by the sideline of the new school course.
Some of them take off their shirts and reveal a sweaty back, unmissable sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most team members, this few minutes of nothing-doing complements the midday break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the rooms after three hours of training to study for final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place at 6:30 p.m.
“For these guys, the next three days will be a real macaque,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said a while before Monday went off on Tuesday.
By eliminating two exercises in one day, the NCAA wants to relieve players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exam ends.
This is why the first three UCLA trainings are planned at 19:15 - to fit into the already overcrowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora spent as a coach in Westwood, Bruins’ training camp begins a week earlier than last year, and trainings are limited for the summer semester.
A total of 18 trainings are scheduled until August 20, and formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team are launched in September.
The sea has been heard that it supports NCAA’s decision, even though it has added another item to the already charged player’s diary.
“For three or four days, players are under a lot of stress and it’s very exhausting for them,” Mora said.
\"But no one gave up, everyone's trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy looking at clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and luxury hotel Luskin Center, which occupied players after collecting the protective net behind the goal bar.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that once the rooms are empty during the season, there could be a problem.
“The land will be guarded by the security service,” Mora added.
“Security is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
Such material is traded well.
Fortunately, the hotel will guard security as well as parking no. 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will go well.
Everything is planned -
Facebook plans to control facts more closely to limit the number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to control third parties and show findings under its original posts in an effort to fight so-called fake news, Facebook said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which will send to third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under the original posts.
Facebook has been described as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe these unconfirmed reports have influenced the election of the president of the United States last year.
In Europe, political debates are being held. French voters are inundated with the lavage of false reports on May's presidential elections, and Germany is planning to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September elections if it does not quickly eliminate angry contributions.
Facebook said on Thursday in a statement released in Germany that it was about to launch testing for a new fake news control feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying third-party-verified messages, people ask for more content to be better informed and to be able to make the right decision about what they can share,” Facebook’s product manager Sara Su said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the “related articles” function and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake messages.
Create graphic novels: a story about A Castle in England
The small castle Scotney Castle has recently played a major role in Squeeze's music video, and Margaret Thatcher also found her refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney witnessed 700 years of stormy history from his cozy place near the Bewl River in Kent, UK, which inspired the cuddly Jamie Rhodes of York County, known for his passion for historical documents, to create a graphic novel.
“The view of the writing of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me,” Rhodes says with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in the castle of Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Eduard Ages. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents by the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
“I was interested in the fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for Jacobites,” he said.
\"That's his thumb print!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
If I put myself in a letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I Love Archives -
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to live almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian \"new - castle, through the archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of hyena on the wall and bottles that were driven for centuries in the moat.
He walked around the property and explored the ruins of the old castle, spoke with the hounds, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night \"drunk whiskey and wrote -
The confidential history of Scotney is relatively large unknown as the National Trust won access to documents only in 2006 after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees only began to penetrate the archives he described with words, as if “the aristocrats of many centuries cast their hands with the words: ‘Take it into the attic’.
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing the property: “You may think the dispute about the land is boring,” Rhodes said, “but I came across one case when two families were stretching over the birch.
Let the people -
Some stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and dive deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourr, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Uprising in 1381.
“I found a record of a rebellion at the castle in 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,” Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought that rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe it’s related to something at the end of the day,
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, who tells the story of a Jesuit priest whose family has been hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about a 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered only a few years after the discovery of the coffin).
Rhodes' favorite family is Darrell's: \"I was interested in the male generation - then men were always indebted and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
The different generations of the Darrell family dealt with this by taking rich or old ladies - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to mottle their heads to heirs -
With the end of the stay at the castle, Rhodes searches for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week strike in the Finnish wilderness, where he was inspired by his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But this is a special place for Scotney.
“I was sad when I left,” he said.
“I said to myself, ‘Now I’m going back to real life.’
Washington changes green card conditions
The media has published the words of President Donald Trump on a new U.S. immigration plan, which will also change when granting a green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of more stringent rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be presented to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and change the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will be preferred by English-speaking applicants, who are entangled in funds and will demonstrate the capabilities that will benefit our country,” Trump said.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be careful
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sexual robots will appear online.
Yeah.
Sexual robots are very popular right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots over the next five to ten years.
According to a former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to look at the rise of sexual robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the warts and the appearance of the robot’s nails.
“People are getting tired of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more,” Sharkey said.
Modern sex aids are transformed from inflatable masters to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course there is artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can “edit” the robot from the color of the eyes and the shape of the warts to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it is very disturbing that many robots have their own “personality” that would shame Stepford’s panic.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set different character traits, including shame.
And then there's the sexual robot woman Roxxxy Gold from True Companion, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including \"frigid Farrah - which is characterized by its shy nature and \"wild Wendy - with \"adventure\" nature.
“The Roxxxy Gold personality is set up to suit your personality as much as possible,” True Companion said.
He likes what you like and vice versa.
He's even moody, just like people.
She can be tired, talk, or “in a mood.”
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for several reasons - among which there is no confusion for real interpersonal relationships. More disturbing are the inferior female character traits and violent impressions - e.g. frigid (read-resisting) Farrah.
The True Companion company on its website resembles Roxxxy to a man-to-man vibrator.
“When a woman may have a vibrator, why couldn’t a man Roxxxy have,” the statement reads.
However, sexual robots are not simply a fetish or a sex device.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift from ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for captivating sex with an optional superintendent.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sexual robots still remain on the margins of interest to the general public.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set by the present modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they're given the excuse of a free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women all over the world gain their rights and the White House is home to a president who often expresses himself very shyly at the address of a woman.
The most horrific aspect of the series The Story of the Maid is not what we see - the hanging bodies and the outstretched eyes, as rather the reality of these visions.
The story of the maid represents a step in the right direction, but now it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots should be as similar as possible to real women (though with the rates of porn actresses).
Their creators design them so that they are pleasant to touch and act at first glance as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their “personality”, the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would stimulate their independence or disrupt their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are nice slaves.
It says 21st century: service.
The NBA star on the green arm.
Curry is fighting for a cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose his first shot in the premier race between professional golfers.
The two-time award winner for NBA’s most useful player played the first round at the Ellis Mae Classic tournament of the lower Web.com Tour series in Hayward, California, at 74, and will fight for a cut.
The Golden State player, who won a second title with the Warriors team this season in the NBA, started a lot nervously and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at fairway.
Even then, he wasn’t as accurate as under the basketball basket, yet he left ten professionals behind with a four-stroke balance above the steam.
“It wasn’t the perfect way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first fire, but then take a little seat,” Curry said, adding that he had been hit by a lot of trouble.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I hoped for.
“If you told me I would play 74 in the first round, I would take it right away,” he added.
If Curry manages to fight the cut, which will probably be set two wounds under steam, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
“I want to play better next time, and now that I’ve gotten rid of the course, it’s probably going to go,” said an enthusiastic golfer who has already played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under PGA.
To participate in Ellis Mae Classic, he received a sponsorship exception and maintained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
The unmistakable sign of the Trump era is the political divisions that divide American voters, and on a micro scale, they also break down entire families.
In the Christmas and Thanksgiving seasons, it was advice on how to deal with relatives who vote for Trump.
We're just waiting for our nerves to be allowed.
However, less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to seal the family.
I'm talking about it because this week my cousin, a poet and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago, has been visiting me in New York for a long time for a Republican fool.
She reminded me that she could have a strong effect in the face of a common enemy.
Now, with Trump in the White House, there is suddenly a whole family - including all Republican siblings, with whom she has had a long-term political campaign - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but I'm impressed that this poses a significant risk in a broader context.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.
When we talk about “normalization,” and Trump, we refer to the frightening possibility that his charities may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes, right-wing Republicans, who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these days with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy act - a dog on the roof of the car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which seem to be very mild compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it will be enough for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel that runs the New York Parks Department - you won't find better use for your three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the center cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed and in horror they look at their own shoulders - a completely gloomy view, and the crimping music of the dome resembles public transport.
Many clichés will soon freeze: the view from high-rise buildings, the panorama looks at you, instead of breathing on you the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Fifty-five years later, I still didn’t move over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese - not counting on the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the metro station in London.
However, the carousel in Central Park produces a remarkablely magical experience, to the extent that two two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, will have great fun on it.
If I could evaluate the carousel, he would deserve the maximum points, but luckily no one asks.
This week, I had a similar experience in the store when I was asked to evaluate my experience on a scale from one to five when paying my credit card.
In a cafe at the corner of my street, it's the same, with the difference that I can put 15% of the prop for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the maid is thus forced to entangle in friendly shoppers when it is not necessary.
A woman in the store apologized with a smile when I reluctantly evaluated my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for a cut wound on his wrist, which, according to the statement of the prison, caused himself after the fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appeal against the original death sentence.
Steenkamp's girlfriend killed her in the early morning at Valentine's Day in 2013 with a few fire wounds through the door of the dressing room in her house in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he was wrong with the thief.
The defendants announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which according to their words is too mild.
The National Prosecution Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial would take place this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is at risk of extending his sentence to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a captive breeding panda that paired in the wilderness.
This is a huge success for the Panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the genefond panda kept in captivity.
An employee of the Zhang Zhong center told the New China agency that panda breeding is at great risk of being forced to cross.
There were only 471 pands in captivity at the end of last year.
In the wild, there are only two thousand survivors.
Trying to let the captured pandas mate with the wild ones is such a first step to helping the breeding panda to protect this species.
The 15-year-old Cchao-cchao was released into the natural reserve at the beginning of the Pandi's mating period on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists were able to observe every step of it.
She met Cchao-chao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and fell successfully.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because the male pandas are not considered the most successful animal lovers.
Males fairly poorly estimate the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and do not know what to do.
Young people were born healthy and, although Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after childbirth.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the arrest of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, citing bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were arrested on August 1st in the morning by the Sithonic Police.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to BTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
The controls will take place throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
After the first round of the British Open, Spilková is in the 50th place.
Golfer Klára Spilková is ranked 50th after the first round of the Major British Open.
The playing field in Kingsbarns, Scotland, had a score of one hit under the steam when she played three birdies and two bogeys.
A 22-year-old Czech player has the hope of going through a cut for the first time.
The entrance to the $3.25 million prize contest was made to the best American star Michelle Wieová, who won the first round in the 64-stroke record, i.e. eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands remove millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Supervisor NVWA said it was investigating 20 per cent of all Dutch poultry plants, which means 80 per cent of eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk is only a limited number of egg types recognizable by specific numbers.
According to German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and poses no danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesperson Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where authorities have also joined the closure of farms, have not recently been imported into the Czech Republic.
However, veterinarians will take motivated samples of eggs and chicken from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets there were problematic insecticide brands.
According to the veterinary authorities, the eggs from Belgium were last in April and the eggs from the Netherlands in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of preparations against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
“I have to go back there one day,” said the 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlín dress.
It depends on whether he gets involved in the start of the new year.
What were the four years you lived in Latvia?
If I were to rate it as in school, three.
I didn't catch much for the first year, I had an experienced goaltender in front of me.
I've been learning.
The second year I started to catch.
Before season three, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought a new goaltender, with whom I alternated again.
Last year, I thought I'd keep catching.
But during the opening ten matches, we only scored five points, so the coaches started to do it.
At the end of the day, my friend caught up.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's a small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss you.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we'll get married next year.
So I brought something.
How challenging is KHL for goalkeepers?
The first 10 teams are very good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, who have to change their playing style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the playground.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
They shoot less, and even if they have a semi-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There is only more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Didn’t the problem of traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don’t have a family, it’s not a problem.
She can sleep peacefully.
The program is usually done by playing four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians see their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
Fandi all.
Even though it didn’t work, there were a lot of people.
Did Dinam’s role in the KHL help to ensure that Latvia almost went to the quarter-finals at this year’s World Cup?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since the same time, their results have begun to go up at the World Cup.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts has been promoted in Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs is before signing the contract.
Why do so many people come here?
They're not any bee players, they're really quality.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, and Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL is starting in three weeks.
Why are you still unengaged?
At the beginning of February, I knew that I would not continue in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for a goalkeeper, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We had fun with different teams, but in the final they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to show up.
Are you nervous about that?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what would happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am at home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The question is, when and where to sign.
How real is the variant that you will start a new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what's going to happen in a month.
Now I can just wait to see what the agent says.
Do you prefer a competition?
The last season wasn’t so I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's flight to Let's keep going.
In January of this year, I wrote in the article With the care of the proper economy?, i.a., about the camp in Lety u Orlik.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so let me remember the basic passages of the article.
The camp in Flights has been discussed for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it will probably be best if they look at, for example, the official website of cultural monuments Pietná na Lety.
There, in the beginning of the historical review, he learns that the camp stood two kilometers east of Lety, that from 8th August 1940 he served as a labor camp, from 1st January 1942 he was a gathering camp, and from 2th August 1942 he became a gypsy camp.
The following text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first Latvian prisoners were included in Auschwitz transport.
On 4th May 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp by the largest transport.
There was a total of 420.
A very sad history of the immense sufferings of human beings, which have caused them human beings in turn and overthrown ideologies.
There is no dispute that these events must be constantly remembered.
There is no dispute that it should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s, pork was built nearby and part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995, a monument was discovered in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and tear down pork, but so far it has not happened.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has fallen under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the piglets.
There are so many facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of pork and decided to draw up an expert assessment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy pork.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman, there are some numbers, but I would probably use those intentions if I went public with them.
We'll see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
In any case, it will not be cheap.
And yet only a few hundred meters from the former camp there is a monument, in which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was financed beautifully by the UN Committee on Human Rights, which seems not to be a threat, I think it would be the same throwing out of money.
Does the government have no other priorities?
A memorial, a worthy place of penitentity, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the past tragedy, and whoever wants, there can be a monument to the suffering and murdered.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let it be as it is, and let us keep the place with utmost care.
The responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, should treat the care of the proper economy.
At least with a company like your own!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister is not the entire government.
But still, from the point of view of the above, I see the password of the leader of the YES movement as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This year, I went straight to see the place.
Very decent driveway, modified parking lot, replicas of wooden camphouses.
In one exposure, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own habitation, which is made of stones located in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as it fits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently taking place at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the founding foundations could not be preserved and at least visually made available in an appropriate manner.
In this direction, the Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could strain his efforts.
If he manages to enforce the redemption of pork for state money in the government, it will only be another unfortunate step in his already problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, the new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 patients in the UK causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps create immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, head of the study, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the destruction of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the weight bowl is tilted to the side of inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of the research, researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan cells - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a connection between one species of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a common part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that support the body’s tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells -
At the same time, he suggested that if it turned out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuteri and diet rich in tryptophan would help develop a more inflammatory and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
A postgraduate researcher, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group lacked separate cells.
She derived from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse was tested by DNA alignment method, and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that lacked a second group of mice.
The mice, which were kept in a sterile environment and lacked intestinal microbiome - so they did not develop this kind of immune cells - were given bacteria L. reuteri - and they created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuters in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
The immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After dispersing the dose of tryptophan, at the same time, it decreased by half the number of cells.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in genes associated with tryptophan have been detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably seek to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri bacteria may increase the cell population.
José Mourinho considers the signing of the treaty with Nemanje Matic and his transfer to Manchester United to be ‘genial’
Manchester United won “geny” in the form of Nemanja Matić, at least José Mourinho thinks it after the midfielder made his debut in the Wednesday match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a £40 million contract, made his first win at 2:1 in Dublin - the last pre-season match against the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impress Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira in his role as a midfielder.
However, since he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matić did not take the form and played only 45 minutes, on which, according to Mourinha, it is necessary to work before the beginning of the next season of the Premier League.
“It takes time, but it’s experienced, intelligent, and has brilliant thinking,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him get in shape as soon as possible.”
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romela Lukaku also played the first match at the Aviva Stadium and Mourinho began to slowly shape his eleventh for the next season.
An independent source this week announced that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with the other three players, but insists that the club did “fantastic work” and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
“Thank you for helping me get three out of four players,” he added.
“Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they’ve done their best for me.
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins Ládi Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-proclaimed picture started drawing thanks to a new show on TV Prima Zdenkov Academy.
The pear immediately took the chance.
“Dear Zdenek, I would like to apply for this at your cooking academy, because I think I can learn a lot from you,” he called on him in a video on the social network.
And since the two of you have been peaking for several years, Láďa has not forgotten to irritate him even this time.
“In return, I can teach you Znojem from dietary chicken, American cucumbers, or invite you to water and show you why your favorite cheese is fried,” said Hruška.
He is serious about his participation in Pohlreich’s new show.
It is time to move up the level and learn from the master.
“The question is what the boss said,” he said.
But he didn’t say no because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, boss!
Only Prima reacted to the participation of Hruška in the culinary academy with the fact that the whole matter takes as his personal activity, which goes outside of television.
Hrušek Pohlreich planted a big blow in December 2004 with his first cook.
Over 300,000 units were sold in a few days!
The new show, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference on the autumn broadcasting scheme, is an unfamiliar cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from among the audiences and in twelve works he will familiarize them with twelve cooking techniques.
In the last episode of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdenek on the back of his trick to iron a crossed pear.
If he had my face there, I would have laughed a lot.
“Besides that pear, I just laugh - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins,” said Láďa.
He thinks of Láď’s culinary art.
“Cooking according to Ládi Hruška does not come into consideration even at home, because I do not let go of gastropunk,” the boss clearly said.
I really appreciate Zdenek Pohlreich, even making a chicken for honey.
But on my show, his recipes will definitely not appear, - he did not forgive the pear.
He's a fool!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
“Gastronomic illiteracy or an idiot,” Pohlreich said in a lecture.
“I’m not twenty to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don’t address them anymore,” Hruška said in a statement.
A British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock a car and a house by waving
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip prepared into the body. By simply waving his hand, he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Steven Northam, 33, has implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and currently offers the same service through his BioTeq company to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the procedure for implantation and compliance.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted to dogs and cats, and the whole procedure lasts 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also offers a service to exchange door and car locks, compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
The married father of one child has the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts with a simple wave of hands.
White House Requisition Costing Taxpayers thousands of Dollars
The White House's decision to fly with the Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the American manufacturing industry last month came to $24,000 according to the Navy records issued by the TIME weekly.
Green White helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the top of the program of July 17 in the White House, which was a show of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials watched a product show from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was exposed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and asked for the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the landing of a helicopter on South Lawn under “extraordinary events,” reports Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), a unit responsible for the administration of the helicopter.
“I wanted to make sure you were aware of such an important event,” said HMX-1 commander in an email to his superior, a representative of the Navy commander for aviation the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7 a.m. on the occasion of the show, which was scheduled to begin at 15 a.m. and will remain in place until the complete cleaning of the whole site, which was planned between 18:00 and 11:00.
The e-mail further stated that if a delay occurs on departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for return flight due to the Working Time Regulation.
The original crew stayed on the scene that evening, along with the helicopter, and along with them a unit of security personnel.
It was not apparent from the records - received by TIME - that the second crew was finally sent.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government assets for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
“We were interested in whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was all right,” the commander wrote.
\"It sounds like they're blocking you,\" the commander said.
This show, “Made in America,” was designated as an official event by the White House, and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the president promoted a health reform that passed through the Senate and talked about an attempt to keep the government regulation in check.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence solely due to presentation slides is unusual.
Trump ordered control in February after a presidential plane ran in the background at his first meeting in a campaign in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is filled with complaints about the use of a presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
“The White House is pleased with the show ‘Made in America’, which has introduced products from all 50 states produced by Americans from American materials,” the statement said.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in Washington and South Lawn and train possible flights with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump took part in the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight at the Made in America show was part of the current crew training, the official said.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew as part of \"non-presidential support missions - another 11 hours.
The White House said that no other props were paid out of the taxpayers' money.
Sikorsky said the company was in no way involved in negotiations on the issue of a helicopter at South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights and the exact costs in connection with the show are difficult to determine according to the Navy’s statement.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017 is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records give time 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
“To indicate the costs of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement of expenditure is very misleading,” Walters said.
\"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual costs -
According to a 2015 RAND study, compensation for the costs of the DD does not include personnel costs, but includes fuel prices, maintenance and contractual costs.
Back then, White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for the purpose of the show.
“The idea of the show that takes place this week is to introduce products produced in the USA,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state, and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of a helicopter and other military facilities in which countless American citizens are involved.
This fact is to be remembered -
It's unclear if Trump was looking at a helicopter while he was on his way to South Lawn, and it's certain that he just sat behind the wheel of one of the fire cars.
Back in the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky’s representative and joked about his own product fleet.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the president, “it owns three of us.
A young woman was stuck in a swamp near Mách's lake, and the police were brooding her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around the second hour of the morning.
Instead of swimming, she was trapped in wetlands.
When she asked the police to help her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent battery.
“For this reason, police officers soon lost connection with her,” police spokesman Ivana Baláková said.
Several police guards went to the place she described, but finding a young woman wasn’t easy at all.
“Some of the policemen had to rooster the wetlands hundreds of meters before they felt a solid ground under their feet,” Baláková said.
And so was the missing one.
The police were guided by the direction in which she called for help.
“In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would be counting out loud,” the spokesperson said.
Policemen found a woman in three quarters of five in the swamps in Borný.
She was on the verge of both physical and psychological forces and showed signs of cold.
She was taken to a Czech hospital by an ambulance.
A grandfather's connection with a man?
From the desired bride becomes a sales girl.
That's a little irony.
With his web project hlameslusny.cz as if a billionaire told voters that STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also claimed that a politically dissatisfied party of less well-known mayors and independents, in fact, has no nationwide agenda for the House elections.
Her electoral candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, whatever political opinion he has.
Once upon a time, Vita Bárta began to do this, and it didn’t work out very well.
In his pursuit of decent people and personalities, which will be replaced by some mayors as well, as Gazdík admitted, his grandfather also cancels the popular argument of the head of the STAN, that the greatest value of the movement is political screening and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, even according to surveys.
They are now peacefully replacing the rapidly collected unknown personalities.
The total breakup with the people, after which STAN changed both the logo and the slogan, Gazdík also explained that the movement did not want to lose its identity to the candidates of the people.
But if STAN from the identity was already suspected by few, after the arrival of Grandpa, the mere game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík has long been opposed to ANO Andrei Babiš, but on the first joint press, Grandpa, who publicly praises Babiš, said: “My goal is to have the Yes movement, that is, the Mayor’s movement win 20 percent in the upcoming elections.”
Let's hope you didn't confuse the movement.
Grandpa is a successful entrepreneur, and the billionaire is certainly not by chance.
He often speaks of politics like Babiš, but unlike him, he will not be his own political brand.
For some time now, STAN has been reminding of a reality show rather than a real political party, and Grandpa's helping hand as if she was making the bride even more a sales girl.
For some time, STAN went with TOP 09, then with the people, and now he is looking for decent people for change.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs practiced helicopters in Bridge
Dogs specialized in the search for explosives and search dogs practiced helicopters at Lake Most.
A police dog must not be fearful and afraid of flying, said Petr Tomášek, head of the police cynologists of the Ustecké Region.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At the Bridge, they practiced both adult trained dogs and those who are just going through training.
In addition to the standard training in which they were to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and look for a lost figure, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
In order for the helicopter to immediately sit down, the dog can go to work so that he does not have a problem with the journey of the helicopter.
“The helicopter will sit, the dog will go and immediately look,” Tomášek said.
A dog who is restless or unable to work immediately on the way by helicopter is excluded from training.
“They are mostly kept by dogs in the garden, for example,” added Tomášek.
The police have 76 dogs with various specializations in the Ustice Region.
German shepherds prevail, but Belgian shepherds also grow.
The dog takes care of him from the puppy.
“He raises him himself, prepares him for the service that the dog will do for us,” added Tomášek.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which may reveal possible health defects.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, it will pass the first exams in 20 months.
“It takes about two and a half to three years to intervene,” said Tomášek.
The length of service at the police depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
They usually live with their dogs.

The United Nations says Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, are involved, a UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the United Nations Assistant Mission, said the elections to the local councils were attended by hundreds of women, three women applied for as vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters were women.
“The roles of women cannot be overlooked,” he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative and credible only if women participate, as well as all related processes related to elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on April 5.
The Taliban published several threats against the electoral process, which shifts international combat activity to the second stage.
In this year’s elections, for the first time, one democratically elected government is handing its power peacefully to the following government.
Haysom said the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan’s democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that of the total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million women were women.
A unique brewery cooks beer again.
For a good beer to a resurfaced brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned a few years ago to the life of the brewery in Lobč u Mšen.
The brewery first mentioned in 1586 has a Renaissance core, and in the nineteenth century it was converted into a paratrooper operation.
It was followed by years of flowering, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beer.
Unfortunately, during World War II, production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, they have served the building of a state ship.
The work of destruction was done by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was demolished and disassembled into building materials.
In 2007, however, there was new hope in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzová.
They began to repair buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to studying archive materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same form as in the nineteenth century when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded with the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European Industrial Heritage Paths.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was solemnly restored.
To taste a great lobby beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínska, visit the piste in the brewery area.
When cooking beer, cocorine water is used here in the protected landscape area, malt from the lobby fields and gypsum hops.
You can taste a traditional light lager, but also dark beer and specials.
And don't miss a tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noons and halfs.
The largest artillery fort in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest strengths of its type on a global scale?
Such a unique building was supposed to be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the field back over the village of Babí.
It was originally supposed to form up to 12 bunkers connected to a large underground.
Here it was supposed to be a headquarters, a carnage, munitions, material, power plant, machinery and hospital.
The Munich Agreement ended.
In less than a year, the only massive reinforced concrete cell was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from Stachelberg, who began to reconstruction in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The underground is already available from 75%!
In addition to the T-S 73, the complex is equipped with an object of light fortification, two built-in infantry screws, moors and a educational trail fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshment, cozy altana and breathtaking views of the country guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building is listed next to the Great Wall of China, the Traian Port of Rome or the Assyrian Palace of Nineveh and Nimrudu.
The Chotěšov monastery originally from the early thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged building of the convention over a wonderful garden.
The list he got to, but unfortunately belongs to the unique buildings that are at risk of extinction.
However, the enthusiasts do not want to give up, and they organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next year of Dinner for the Chotěšov monastery on this Saturday, August 5, where will be performed, among others. Vladimír Míšík, Ivan Vodek, you will see a fencing performance and you will look at places of wonderful large buildings that are usually inaccessible.
You will enjoy the atmosphere of this wonderful place.

Get to know the plant with one click.
Students with the creation of herbars and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free application Pl@ntNet.
If they are interested in what kind of plant they have just encountered on a walk, they will be advised.
All they need to do is photograph the plant, and the application itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the Centre for Ethics and Environmental Education of CEEV in Bratislava’s Mountain Park as part of the project Secret Life of the City.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools took part in the project, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers in the application database.
The newly created French app is free to download on the city's Secret Life page.
The main goal of French programmers was to contribute as many people as possible to the application of their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
“The children who keep the tablet or mobile in their hands can go to the forest,” said Ivana Poláčková, coordinator of the project.
Based on a sufficiently high quality photo of the flower, leaf or fetus, the application can recognize its name within a few seconds, which will then be assigned under the photo in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the project Secret Life of the city.
It is therefore welcome that, after setting up an account, users contribute by taking a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
“The French will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database,” Poláčková said.
Concerns about investment in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The unions demand assurance from the McVitie’s dryer manufacturer’s managers about the long-term production commitment at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company was still silent about any investment in the Tollcross plant.
There are more than 500 employees at the factory who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said it has invested more than £5 million in the area over the past few years.
She added that workers and trade union representatives would be “between the first informed” in the event of changes in factory operation.
In a letter to the construction director of the company, the Scottish GMBs expressed their concern that McVitie’s “will not receive its promise to finance and modernise production lines.”
GMB chief organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the builder about the needs of the company and the future investment plan at Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Many families have worked there, and employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where the work in the factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
In terms of labour, wages and benefits, and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising costs of living and falling slow production, the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie’s.
A spokesperson for Pladis said: “The builder Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we value a continuing commitment to employees and union representatives.
Regular meetings with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago, and many problems were discussed openly at this meeting.
We talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested £5 million in Tollcross, especially in production lines and operational efficiency.
We highly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and its localities, and in the event of any changes to the operation of the factory, employees and representatives of trade unions will be immediately informed -
Did PSG Barcelona warn about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to win on his side after she deposited £189 million, i.e. the amount needed to redeem Neymar from the treaty, but has this French team warned Barcelona about his record raid three years ago?
The Ligue 1 Club is ready to exceed more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, which paid £89 million for him last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best-paid professional athlete in the world - after tax, Neymar will collect over £500,000 per week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is indignant about Neymar's commitment to his contract, despite the fact that the confidential source has confirmed that the club has always tried to satisfy Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelafi warned all the clubs who would be interested in defending one of the best PSG players.
“I’m not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will definitely reach one of their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences.
Barcelona appears to have crossed the imaginary border as it expressed interest in PSG backup Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances will it allow the Italian representative to leave, so it is possible that Barcelona now with the departure of Neymar is swallowing a bitter pill for its defamatory actions.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have a broad understanding of rules?
Donald Trump nodded on anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was doing nothing to the North Korean threat and that it would not continue to do so.
Even this clears the idea of sanctions as a straw from the shoes.
Those things can't be thrown in one bag.
Madur's Venezuela really set out on the road to dictatorship, ba totalitariana.
China does not behave as much as the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if all of this were to be summed up so that even the ordinary voter, American, European or other, he could understand what it is and what system of rules the policy of sanctions is based on, it would be almost impossible to do so.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only touching what President Obama has already prepared, but he has only given an executive stamp.
So why such a stir?
Last year, Europe was scared that if Trump wins the US election, he would take care of Putin and appeal sanctions.
A terrible idea.
In practice, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not freed, but tougher.
Europe is even more scared.
German Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Is it like a kosher is only a sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian sanctions on the EU.
European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
Is it as if sanctions are only weak enough to threaten anyone?
The ordinary electorate taps.
For three years he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It is now known that it is the EU's energy security.
The electorate also taps more widely.
The sanctions are coming to Russia for being too montaged where it doesn’t exist.
China is being lost because of the fact that little is being assembled.
The Venezuelan president is punished for building dictatorship within the borders of his country.
All these punishments or just considerations have rationality.
Does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babiš: I am not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crossing the republic with his visionary book and finalizing the electoral program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, all candidates are ready.
According to his words, he did not interfere significantly with them.
He even agreed to lead the Moravian-Silesian president and shadow education minister ANO Ivo Vondrák.
“But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member or a captain,” Babiš said.
A lot of representatives and national politicians were angry with your thesis that directly elected mayors and primates should drive the municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we are voting directly for the president and I am convinced that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
In my book I am not talking about the interference of the representatives, they can be there.
The question is how many there will be.
In the presentation of your book What I dream of when I accidentally sleep, I heard on my own that you were talking about the cancellation of the representatives.
I don't remember.
I was talking about a direct election and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York, with nine million inhabitants, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is accused of doing little and not preparing large projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government that only two people, Klaus and Zeman have managed in our history.
Which I'm not saying they did it well.
But the current Prime Minister doesn’t drive anything, he’s just moderating the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you want to implement the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to do it.
We only have a change in the program for a one-wheel election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a moving mandate of ministers and an amendment of the Rules of Procedure of the House to avoid unnecessary exhibitions of Members, who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to present themselves at the meetings of the Houses.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
This is exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That as a dictator you will govern the government, control the House with 101 deputies, abolish the Regions and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors you will control the whole country.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of members.
French President Macron reported a third reduction in the legislative body, with 57,000 French on one legislator, while we have 17,000 Czechs.
No one blames Macron for threatening democracy.
Even if someone wins majority elections in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms to prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
For those who have a parliamentary majority, however, they are great, it is enough to look to Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing in the case of the yes movement.
We just need a team that will work in government for people, not for their parties or resorts.
For example, I don’t understand why we couldn’t agree that only the salaries of teachers, staff in culture and social services will increase.
Why did they vote for me and add 21 percent to the GIBs who are already taking 60,000?
Would you be the prime minister for that?
The prime minister is expected to intervene when ministers act in an uneconomic manner, confuse the government with a travel agency, and would like to do business as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
The ministers in the government have no idea, the contradictions are to be said outside of it.
A ready-made material must go to the cabinet, there is no place for coalition splits, power vote and business, there is a decision to make.
How do you want to have a consistent team when ministers act mostly party-side?
There is a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition treaty was not in force, and that Babish had gone out of government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if there is a personality and has control skills, a similar plan of gesture does not need.
It measures everyone the same way and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would propose to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, because we won't even be in that government, no one wants to work with us, even if I don't know what I've done so terrible.
So much scepticism is not in place.
The mayors have won an entrepreneur Grandpa who would like to work with you, with the people he may win the wing of the bowed Jiří Čunk.
I don't think so.
ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not exclude the coalition with YES, in the ODS will perhaps be promoted by Václav Klaus ml., who will also not oppose.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said you have many points in common with the SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the immortars come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, ran as a puppet of Vita Bárta for VV, then earned money for his company from Dawn, there was some coup.
He is of course a strong personality.
It's a bit brown.
When I take his program, there is a broad involvement of people in the management of society, a direct democracy, that can be agreed upon.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you, who speaks in protests with gallows and wants to leave the EU?
We're not thinking about working with Mr. Okamura's side, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the electorate will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the other in order, but God knows who the winner will be and who the two will be.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let's go back to your pursuit of becoming a company.
But the government simply has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything be avoided, never decided.
Coalition issues such as ČEB or EGAP did not work.
Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was the reason he threw me out.
As soon as he did this, the Czech government was in control.
It is incredible, after all, that the Prime Minister brought the resolutions written by the management of CZECH, which imposes on the Minister of Finance, how he is to vote at the General Assembly.
If you were to become prime minister, you would change staff relations in the Supervisory Board and exchange the top management of CZECH?
Jesus, if I'm the Prime Minister, I'll see you.
I'm not one yet.
It's a good idea that CZECH has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to exchange for even better with YES.
After the election, everything goes on.
I don't know anything about it.
I have no lobbyist, I have no humble or rosé, I am a separate unit, and I do not address this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you are at the forefront of the government, will you seek to exchange the leadership of CZECH, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institutions you criticize?
I would like CZECH to be a transparent company.
So far, he has been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
Just look at Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he was supposed to be a majority state, he never ran it, he was only there to the number, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
CZECH has to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them in a subsidiary company, arrange financing, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state is to fund and build new nuclear blocs is absurd.
The Czech Television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don’t have and I won’t have any competence to throw someone out.
But mastering yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television charges, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of CEOs of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
See how the news is discussed, the super power pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This is true of both the current parliamentary commission on leaks from the investigation files and the lex Babiš.
Sobotka was so stupid that he was forced by Kalousk to throw me out of the government, which was a percentage of TOP 09, but ČSSD took them off.
They are afraid of disrupting their corruption system, so they are talking about the threat of democracy by Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you say in an article describing how First Vice-President ANO Jaroslav Faltýnek builds the power base by putting his son into the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and equips a related lawyer Kvetoslav Hlín with contracts with city and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Railways?
We have a lasting dispute about it.
I don't like it, and I've read it a few times.
Faltinek argues that this lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the Socans, never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, Kratochvílová, Březin.
If there was any sign of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
In this respect, I am uncompromising.
If something like this happens, we'll get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
