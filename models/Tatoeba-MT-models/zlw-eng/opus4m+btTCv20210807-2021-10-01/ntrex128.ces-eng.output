The members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will “appear like Mupeti.”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are confronted by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is plans to change the name of the assembly to the Velšský Parliament.
The members of the assembly, across the political spectrum, are concerned that the name could create a mockery.
One member of the Labour Party said his group was worried that “it is going with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member of the party, Plaid, said that the group as a whole “is not happy” and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was approaching a change in the name \"with an open mind\" - but noted that MWP was close to the word \"Muppet\".
In this context, the Welsh letter “w” is pronounced like the letter “u” in Yorkian English.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is now preparing legislation to introduce the name changes, said: \"The final decision on what will be called the members of the Assembly of the United States, will of course be on the members themselves -
The Law of the Welsh Government of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the authority to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals, where broad support was given to a variant called the Assembly of the Velšský Parliament.
As for the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the greatest support in the public debate.
The members of the assembly apparently propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus may bring concern to President Elin Jones, who is due to make a proposal for legislation within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules for disqualification of members and the proposal for a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the issue of their title as part of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians will vote to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether or not their country’s name will change to “North Macedonia’s Republic.”
All-people vote should resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to Greek territory and has repeatedly protested against requests for membership of the EU and NATO countries.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on name change, said he would not follow the vote.
Voters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are quiet because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival.
“The old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
“There’s no one there today,
The disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People meet in a different way today,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, \"and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started -
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such types of people who will not help the remaining saints in the neighborhood much.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” he says, “and therefore the day will soon come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches.”
The two churches built a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the Black Congregation, whose devotions took place nearby.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise blacks.
The fire damaged the building in 1939, but when Father Johnson’s parishes planned to rebuild it, they also ordered an outsider.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father and his successor to St. Martin, proudly called the bellkoh “Words of the Poor”
The expert, who played at the bell-gauge in July, called it “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bellkoplay in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger bellkog in a church in Riverside.
Mr. Merriweather says that no one has replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, a complicated story of architects and builders took place with St. Martin, some of whom were called by lay representatives of the church, others then episcopal diocese.
In July, the Council of Elders, the head of the parish, consisting of lay representatives, sent a letter to the diocese in which he expressed concern that the diocese would “try to advance the cost” to the council of the elders, although the hiring of architects and builders which the diocese had sent did not participate.
Some parishes complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California who dived for humras
According to the official report, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who dived in California for humras on the day of the start of the humer season.
The attack occurred in the morning shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard a boy call for help, and then to him with the whole group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel stated that the call was first considered to be a delight in the catch of the humra, but then \"he realized that he was screaming - he bit me!
He bit me!’
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that \"he had a broken whole area of the key bone --
“I shouted that everyone should go out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” adds Hammel.
The boy was in critical condition transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
The swimmer, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that the shark had been seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury at the top of the body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to investigations and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's wants to stand up to Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams beauty streets in the style of a department store, where specialized sellers will be available.
As part of a strong entry into the cosmetics market in the UK, which is worth £2.8 billion and is growing further, while sales of fashion and domestic needs are falling, the aisles with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country. In the event of success, they will then expand to other stores next year.
Investment in cosmetics is associated with the effort of supermarkets to find uses for shelves that were previously used for television, microwaves and home supplies.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, and for the first time, it will also include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also be available from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, thanks to brand-named locations similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also re-enters its range of Boutique makeup, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, in two stores, Saintsbury’s will test the concessions of the retail perfume dealer Fragrance Shop. The first such shop was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and next year it will be created in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and moving towards buying small amounts of food in local stores every day means supermarkets need to try harder to attract people.
The CEO of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that stores will increasingly look like department stores because the supermarket chain seeks to offer better services and non-food products to fight discount sellers like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened hundreds of stores in Argos and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are chains he bought two years ago. Thanks to this, food sales and acquisitions have increased even more profitable.
The previous attempt at the supermarket to redesign the department with the cosmetic and pharmaceutical assortment ended infamously.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of proceeds from the sale of drugs in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacies for £125 million to Celesio, which owns Lloyds’ pharmacy chain.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxury skin care brands to four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
The CEO of Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the look and style of aisles with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should meet all the needs and appealing environment, and the convenient location means that we now represent an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change old ways of shopping.
Peter Jones is “infuriated” after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the contract for £11 million
Dragons star Den Peter Jones \"sicks\" after television moderator Holly Willoughby withdraws $11 million from the deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
The couple’s business was compared to Goop’s Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
Seventeen-year-old moderator announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby was enraged by Dragons' star Den Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the reported sources, Jones \"was infuriating - when a television star at a tense Tuesday meeting at the head office of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire admitted that due to new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - she would no longer be able to spend enough time on their homewear and Truly accessories brand.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of moderator Willoughby at an estimated £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that Truly was leaving the brand, Jones left Britain for one of his summer residences.
The source said: “Truly was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which will secure her for several decades ahead.
Her decision to leave all the participants was absolutely shocking.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was going on, the launch was so close.
In the Marlow headquarters is a full warehouse of goods ready for sale -
Experts believe that the departure of the moderator of this Morning, which is one of the most profitable British stars, could cost millions to the company due to the bold investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes and possible further delays of branding.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s mother and husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and Jones joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin in moderating the I'm A Celebrity program on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: \"His business will not comment -
“The troubles of action” and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from journalists as a note that some consider “unworthy president” and how positively he talks about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump replied with his mocking “voice.”
\"I didn't give up on anything -
He noted that after his first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump appreciated North Korea as a big step towards denuclearization, Kim was interested in another meeting.
But negotiations on the destruction of nuclear weapons stuck at a dead point.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the prominent North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “corresponding response” to its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, the U.S. continues sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a much more optimistic view.
\"We're doing great with North Korea,\" he said.
“We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship -
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - ending missile tests, helping to liberate hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers to the country.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about relationships with Kim.
“It’s as easy to act as president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people out of this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd ahead.
The tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia have ravaged the island and killed hundreds of people
In a situation after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs have, for example, learned that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population was expelled from their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they made it very clear that they did not require international assistance, so it is a bit difficult,” said Mrs Sumbung.
Although Save the Children brings together a team that travels to Pala, it is not yet clear if foreign personnel can work here.
A spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutupo, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Paul to see if it would be possible for international organizations to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the earth is still sadly unprepared for the anger of Mother Nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Acehu, this is not common on other parts of the coast.
The loss of human lives is likely to have contributed to the apparent lack of siren warnings in Paul of tsunamis, even though the warning was issued.
Even at the best time, traveling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
In natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which anchored in Lombok and helped the victims of the earthquake, is now moving to Paul, but will take at least three days to reach the place of the new calamity.
Improving Indonesia’s poor infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
The following year, he will seek to elect again, but his government is in trouble with the outages in funding.
President Yoko also faces pressure from the persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority take a more conservative form of faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, has already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people, and tens of thousands have been driven out of their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool shot a levelling goal against Chelsea

He turned the ball to the left and shot it to the far bar.
The shot flew high and headed to the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually jumped the jumping Kepu Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as far forward as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible,” the LiverpoolFC.com server said.
“I saw Kante coming near me, so I didn’t think much about it and shot at one touch.
Chelsea led 1-0 at the goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The attacker Blues sent his passport back to Mate Kovacic, then turned in the middle of the field and sprinted half of Liverpool.
Kovacic ball played fast.
Then he sent the ball with a beautiful aisle to Hazard.
He ran away from the defense and ended up at a distance bar next to Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
On Wednesday, at 15 p.m., Liverpool, a group of Champions Leagues at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, is meeting with a local team.
Chelsea will play on Thursday at 15 o'clock in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
As reported by the Indonesian disaster office on Sunday morning, the number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami waves has risen to 832.
The 7.5-degree earthquake struck Friday, caused waves of up to 6 meters in height and trapped many people in the ruins of collapsed buildings, Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugro said at a press conference.
The city of Paul, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with ruins of demolished buildings.
Police arrest a twenty-two-year-old man suspected of killing a woman
This morning, a female body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and the police immediately launched a murder investigation.

The police called on people around who saw or heard something to sign up.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: \"The investigation is only at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to everyone who moved near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras may have recorded something to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the crime scene thinking they knew a woman to ask where she was found in the morning.
The police said there was an investigation and they are now informing relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in the Grasson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter the building or out of it.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
The people have now learned that it will take several hours before they can return home.
One man told a police officer that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.

Cromwell’s statue in parliament has recently become a hit because of a fight over “rewriting history”
His exile would be a well-deserved punishment for his fanatical Puritan followers destroying many English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal \"the foolishness\" and \"the attempt to transcribe history\"
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was essential that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would also become one of the goals in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or perform an iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, authored by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is proof of the 19th century’s opinion and part of the character’s historiography, which many think it still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, though today a little less than in the late 19th century, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of continuous historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure that represents one side of this divide.
His achievements in the function of Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and reminding -
China's Farmer's Killing Pig
According to local media, a pig was attacked and killed in the South East China market.
As South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, a man named Yan was found dead with an overcrowded artery in a pool of blood near the bread market in Liu-pchan-sui province of Kuejzhou.
The pig breeder is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs in the piglet on 30 May 2005 in the city of Si-ning in the province of Qinghai.
On Wednesday, he arrived with a cousin from the next province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out that the door to the next bread was open.
According to him, he was a big pork with a bloodthirsty.
According to the information, during the forensic examination, it was confirmed that 250kilogram of pork was torn apart by the farmer.
“Bratranec had his feet all bloody and torn,” said Guiyang Evening News cousin, who he calls the surname “Wu”
On a security camera record, Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousins.
The market administrator told Evening News that the pig was closed so that no one else could think when the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Market officials reportedly deal with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
Pig attacks on humans are rare, but have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and injured a man critically.
Ten years earlier, 300kg of pig pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor and was driven away by a farmer's wife.
After an oregon farmer ate his pig in 2012, one farmer from Manitoby told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a “starter”
“They’re just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains will bring heavy rain to the south-west of the United States
Hurricane Rosa, according to the forecast, is weakening and shifting over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States will bring flood rain.
At 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa reached the wind speed of 137 km/h, representing Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a low-pressure base over the Pacific Ocean, moving east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin pushing tropical humidity north to the southwestern part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rainfall on Monday.
Tropical humidity then, with an approach to low pressure in the coming days, will trigger heavy rain in the Southwest of the United States.
The precipitation of 25 to 100 mm locally causes dangerous tide floods, suti currents and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation to close 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the USA, especially above most Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
Under rapidly worsening conditions, due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, influx floods may occur.
Given the danger of tropical precipitation, it would be very unreasonable to walk into the desert.
The heavy rain can cause canyons to become grim rivers, and storms will bring local impact winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure bar will bring strong local precipitation on some parts of the coast of southern California.
There may be a total precipitation of over 13 mm, which could cause smaller currents of the rubbles and slide roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region.
On Sun afternoon and Monday morning, unique tropical outbursts will start approaching Arizona, and Monday evening and Tuesday will increase.
Light rain will spread to four corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense changes in temperatures throughout the U.S., as the Arctic will begin to cool, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes at short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the U.S. Wednesday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will try again to expand the coming summer heat.
In most of the territories in the middle and east of the US, warm start of October with temperatures around 27°C from the southern plains to the north-east of the US is expected.
New York City could be 27°C on Tuesday, about 6°C above average.
In the first half of October, our long-term forecast shows the high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the US.
Bretta Kavanaugh’s hearings have been followed by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people were watching six TV channels on Thursday’s engaging statement of a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Bretta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual assault reportedly occurred in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate continued, and the voters interrupted common programs with reports of a sudden Friday turn: an agreement mediated by Senator Jeff Flake to the Arizona, that the FBI would carry out a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Christine Ford told the Senate’s court committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was wearing her clothes at a high school party in a drunk room.
Kavanaugh said in his statement that he was 100% sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were watched by Nielsen.
The company calculated average follow-up at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers for other stations that were sent by denunciations such as PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking at offices.
In comparison, it is similar to the number of viewers watching football matches in playoffs or the award of Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the greatest follow-up from all stations when, according to Nielsen, 5.69 million viewers were watching him during the day-to-day hearing.
The second was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest persisted even after the end of the meeting.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras captured him on Friday morning as the protesters shouted to him when he was going to go to the elevator at the hearings of the court commission.
CNN transferred live as she stood with her eyes folded for a few minutes and let her swear.
One woman said, “I stand right in front of you.”
“You think the earth is telling the truth,
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and even before closing the elevator door, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later broadcast live when the court's commission was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would do so only if the charges against the candidate were examined by the FBI next week, which was required by a minority of Democrats.
Flakea partly persuaded interviews with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without an investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of saying “politicians” about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union that “politicians are undermining Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview that was close to that with the prime minister on the front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal that Britain and the EU should choose each other’s tariffs was “unquestionable.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of LSU player death
Police arrested a suspect in the case of the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge police department said Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpsons and, according to the Sims police, lost his glasses during the match.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, the police secured glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Simpson, according to the police, admitted that Waydea had been shot.
According to the lawyer, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, East Baton Rouge's Coroner Office published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gun wound on the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Refugee Police Unit, the state police criminalist lab, the Southern University Police and local citizens for helping in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local police for “drinking and seeking justice”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
Last season, the average was 5.6 points and 2.6 points for the match.
Basketball coach LSU Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde's death was \"shocking\" and \"shocked\" him.
“This is what you’re still afraid of,” Wade said.
Volcano Spears Ash in Mexico City
Ash, which is rolling from the Popacatépetl volcano, hit the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after volcano activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a number of storms and storms.
On social media, images of the front glass of cars covered with a thin layer of ash appeared in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians reported an increase in volcano activity, which is located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook Central Mexico in September 2017 and had a strength of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, the police met with Catalan separatists.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters faced orderly police and thousands of people took part in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote that split Catalonia.
The orderly police blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint after them. The one on the streets, which are usually flooded by tourists, created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, there were also clashes to calm down the police had to use tweezers.
In a few hours, independence groups sang, “We will not forget, we will not forgive, in the face of the protesting supporters of the Union who called “Let Spain live”
According to the local press, 14 people were easily injured in protests.
One year after the referendum of October 1, which Madrid considers illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate it, tensions remain in the region seeking independence still high.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but participation in the elections was low because the opponents of the break-up boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police in violent clashes across the region attempted to end voting in electoral rooms.
The independence groups remained out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
An 80-year-old electrician, Narcis Termes, who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes to gain independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we had some of the best moments.
“My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we are in a dead end,” he said.
Despite the important, though close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence-supporting parties had to fight to keep things running this year. Many of their most famous leaders either left for exile themselves or are waiting in custody of the court for their participation in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Twenty-four-year-old monaster Joan Puig recorded a protest to support the police on his phone and said the conflict was stirred by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for trial since the end of last year, announced Saturday that he will be running for the European Parliament next year.
“The candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the collapse of democratic values and the repression that we are witnessing by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after car crash in the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were imprisoned after they repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.

Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, someone shot at the car.
Meng's Trefa secures Livingston's 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won
Livingston, who advanced from the lower division, shocked Rangers and granted Steven Gerrard only the second defeat of 18 matches as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Tref Dolly Mengy proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team this season has not yet won the Premiership at the guest field, and next Sunday the first Hearts will stand on which they lose eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston expanded a number of unbeatable matches in the division to six matches, so the lead coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miler last month, has not yet experienced a defeat.
Livingston did not take the chance
Holt's team was supposed to run long before the goal, because his straightness caused a lot of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he failed in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow just passed Craig Halket's head in front of the goal.
It is enough for the home to watch the Rangers play before them, because they knew that they could suffer from standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
A free kick was ordered against Rangers and Livingston created a glide, Declan Dallas and Robinson together sent out Mengu, who ran and scored the ball at the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, Rangers dominated the ball, but home defense for them was impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly usually did not have much work to do.
The same picture of the game was also in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman stopped the goalkeepers of Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow did not hit another standard situation of Livingston.
The centers were constantly flying into the penitentiary territory of Livingston, which were constantly cleaned by the players, and two penitentiary hounds came in - after Halkett's attack on the replacement Glenn Middleton and others by hand.
‘Fenomen - from Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were without exception excellent, and on their way up they continue to exceed expectations.
Their play style and team have not changed much since returning to the top, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for how the team has outburst since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, led a well-organized defense, while Menga maintained the entire time at the emergency of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they are no longer reaching these standards.
Their ending was poor - they only once penetrated the home page - and for Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has been mixed in Cologne.
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29) for breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and everyone smiled.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to correct relations between allies in NATO.
They were uncomfortable because of a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
In this city is the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police for security reasons prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people - many of them - were Kurds - protesters against Erdogan, who condemned his policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
Antiquity protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: Cyclist dies after car clash
A cyclist died in London after a car crash.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 local time near the crossroads of Bestwood Street with the busy streets of Evelyn Street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and soon an ambulance arrived, but the man was dead.
A few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from Saturday’s tragedy in a Childers Street accident, the driver ran away.
Metropolitan police have said police officers are now trying to identify and inform their relatives.
The road is closed, buses are on alternative routes and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in the riots
According to a prison agency, six guards were injured in high-security male prisons.
The riots broke out in the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and still persist.
To deal with the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing, specialized guards from the Tornado team were called.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on site.
The prison spokesman said: “When dealing with the ongoing incident in the Long Lartin prison, specially trained prisoners were deployed.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend a long time behind the bars.
There are more than 500 inmates in the Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the director of the prison ended after the attack of a prisoner in a hospital.
And last October, order units were called to prison due to serious riots in which the personnel were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the floods of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (a region where it’s dry can be beneficial)
It is not customary for Arizona to hit a tropical low-pressure base, but this is probably what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert south-west and brings the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued a warning of flooding on Monday and Tuesday from Western Arizona to South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday night and bring rain on Monday night.
Phoenix’s National Meteorological Service tweeted: “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have retained the status of a tropical storm or a pressure storm within 320 km of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane yet 64 km from Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona, places up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, 25-50 mm is likely to fall, with local summaries of up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the area has hit dry.
Floods are a very serious thing, but these precipitations may also help somewhere, because the south-west of the US has just hit dry.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona experience “extreme drought,” which is the second highest category.
The journey of Hurricane Rosa will first lead to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with a hurricane power of 137 km/h, will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico on Sunday morning and will travel at 19 km/h to the north.
Then the storm encounters the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses force.
He is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation will be strong, which poses a high risk of flooding.
“In the area from Baja California to Northwest Sonor, a total precipitation of 75 to 150 mm is expected, with up to 250 mm possible,” says the weather.com server.
Rosa then wanders like a tropical storm across Mexico to the north, and on Tuesday she arrives at Arizona's border in the morning, then passes Arizona and enters southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main risk of Rosa or its remains is expected to be very severe precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwestern U.S.,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause deadly floods and streams of rubies in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area at Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4 a.m. local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now “stable.”
Police from Avon and Somerset reported that young men aged 17 to 20 were arrested at night in the Radstock area.
The police are looking for witnesses who could have a record of what happened on their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suitful and angry” Democratic parties
“The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had “suffered the evils and angers of the Democratic Party during the process of his nomination.”
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, where he decidedly and emotionally refused to say to Christine Blasey Ford that several decades ago, when they were teenagers, they sexually assaulted her.
Ford also spoke about her charges.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans were witnesses to Kavanaugh’s splendor and quality and courage.”
A representative of his supporters from West Virginia said: “The voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has excellent public service on his account.”
The president indirectly encountered Kavanaugh’s nomination when he talked about how important it was for Republicans to take part in the mid-term elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m still moving,” he said.
“I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.
Trump says Democrats have decided to “resist and obstruct”
A Republican Party leadership adviser told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination at the Senate is expected to take place on Friday at the latest.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis kill hundreds of people and continue to rise
The authorities announced on Saturday that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit an extensive earthquake and tsunami, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of which were stunned by huge waves that flooded the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, but at dusk, the coast was hit by six-metre waves that killed many people and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The tsunami wave preceded an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they fell to waves for the victim,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugro, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency in Jakarta.
“The tsunami wave didn’t go alone, took cars, rakes, houses, hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami wave spread at 800 km/h on the open sea.
He said some people fled from the wave to the trees and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
Aerial photography, published by the disaster relief agency, shows many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The consequences shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people lived.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s strong shocks was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped during World War II on Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have increased the tsunami wave even further.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found spelled under the ruins of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of victims and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Pala, in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to him, the communication “was completely paralyzed without any information,” from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that workers and volunteers are heading to the affected places.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse,” the statement said.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday because it did not inform Palu that the tsunami had hit the wave, although authorities said the waves came at a time when a warning was issued.
On amateur photos shared on social media, it is heard a man on the upper floor of the building by desperate screams warns people on the street of an approaching tsunami.
Within a few minutes of the coast, the water wall that carries buildings and cars will hit.
Reuters was unable to verify the record immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a large power outage that interrupted communication around Pala, so authorities could only be difficult to coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army began sending cargo aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for transport assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was expected to visit the evacuation centers in Pala on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision staff from Donggala arrived in the city of Paul, where employees were hiding in shelters from certifiers built in the yard of the office building, they saw the paintings of destruction by the way, says Mr. Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed homes,” he added.
It's too bad.
When auxiliary groups began their sad activities to help in disasters, some complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad may start to flow to the place of calamity only when the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the province level,” Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross, said.
“As soon as the government says ‘OK, this is a national disaster’, we can start international aid, but this is not yet the case.
When Paul arrived the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those who are still missing were hoping that their loved ones would be those miracles that ease the gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled a little boy out of the canal.
On Sunday, the rescuers liberated a woman who was imprisoned for two days under the ruins next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists in the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Mr. Gendon described how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he desperately sent messages through WhatsApp to the Pala contestants who participated in the beach festival.
But instead of a pair of blue ticks, his messages ended with a gray mark.
“I think that means that the messages have not been received,” he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while replenishing ATMs in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport police department, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's staff on Friday morning to supplement the Newport ATM on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car washed out the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to put more money into it.
When he did that, another man \"run off the staff of Brink - and stole a bag of money that was to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the site, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
Information about the identity of suspects is available to the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper has changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted, “A place formally known as Kanye West.”
One-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the pseudonym as the name of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should release his new album Yandhi.
The show will replace Ariana Grande, who has cancelled her participation for “citizens,” according to the program’s creator.
West has previously said that the word for him, in addition to shortening the existing professional name, has a religious meaning.
“In my opinion, ‘yes, the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,’ let West hear earlier this year when he spoke about his album with Big Boy radio moderator.
“So it’s us, it’s us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, ye, as merely a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are.
The name has also changed many other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West co-worker of JAY-From his name he also alternately wrote with the connector and without him, and with both large and small letters.
Mexican President Amlo promises not to use army against civilians
On the occasion of the upcoming 50th anniversary of a bloody intervention against students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatellolco Plaza promised that \"he would never use the army to oppress the Mexican people -
At a time when the left-wing student movement was spreading throughout Latin America, soldiers began shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening up other free public universities.
He declared that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education had drawn young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding of artificial intelligence
According to an investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in AI and the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published announcements about AI, although the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced a plan last year to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“A doubled AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are far beyond the U.S. and we’re looking for another breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Lee said this week that doubled funding could double the chance that the next major AI discovery will be made in the U.S.
Lee, who published his book “Superpower AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that outperformed the best American player in Othello, and later was a research manager at Microsoft and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee appreciated the previous U.S. government technology competition, such as the Robotic Challenge Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when next would be to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
“Academic leaders are not leading China, but corporations,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed the best experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help improve AI efforts.
“I believe that green cards should automatically be offered to holders of a doctorate in AI,” he says.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Scientific Council and other government organizations give money to researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of the Artificial Intelligence Electoral Commission.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As for the NSF Foundation, it is now investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, the legislation of the United States, which wanted to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not been doing anything for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the country’s name to “Norwegian Republic”, which would solve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocks membership requests in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, which is why Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU vetoed.
The two governments concluded an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for a boycott raised doubts as to whether at least 50 percent of the voters would be needed to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: \"You are for NATO and EU membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece -
Adopters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying to make Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, able to join organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us,” said Oliver Georgievsky, 79, from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough members of Parliament have said they will follow the result of the vote.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The electoral commission said no problems were reported within 13 hours.
However, the vote was only 16% versus 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters eventually cast their votes.
“I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voters from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko give their votes in a Macedonian referendum on a name change that would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and pulls chairs in front of tents built by people who boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the head raised, not the door for the ministry,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have pride.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%, with so much investment needed.
“I think a large majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
The result “yes” would be “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, a referendum could take part in between 30 and 43 percent of voters - less than the required participation.
In another survey, organized by the Macedonian station Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents were found to vote on Sunday.
70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its onset last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has come for a goal through the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took over Brighton's defense on Saturday to secure Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguera's performance, his goal in the 65th minute seemed ridiculously easy.
It all started with a pass that the Argentine attacker received in the middle of the field.
Prosprinted among the three Brighton defenders and got into the open space.
Aguera was surrounded by four green shirts.
On the edge of Brighton's penitentiary territory, he bypassed one defender and a few more foresights.
Then he found Sterling on the left.
The English striker stuck the ball in the penalty area back to Aguer, who crossed Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he’d be playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what it was.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at that point.
The initial advantage for Sky Blues in this Premier League match was that of Sterling.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
On the left he sent a wonderful ball to Monroe Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to the far bar.
The attacker Sky Blues had a ball on the net just before he was out of the field.
The city will play with Hoffenheim in the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to ruin the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoff fight, there were not many reasons to re-enter.
But the eternally competitive Scherzer hopes to place himself on Sunday in a match against Colorado Rockies - only if the Rockies, who lead in the NL West, have one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for a playoff.
Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night by winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but they still want to win their first title in the division.
“Although we don’t play anything, we can at least play, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with the greatest effort I’ll experience this year.
Why I wouldn’t want to play it -
The Nationals have not yet announced who will begin on Sunday, but it is reported to be a proponent of Scherzer in such a situation.
It would be the 34th start for Scherzer, and he would train and throw on Sundays when he's usually free.
Washington’s right-hand over-threshold has 18-7 statistics with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts this season.
Trump attends a meeting in West Virginia
The president has indirectly expressed his position around his candidate at the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to take part in the mid-term elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done will be at stake.
There are five weeks left in one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's one of the big, big, I'm not running, but we're still on the move and I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by whatever means they need, you can see the impoliteness, the resistance.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they need to roll over to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give it to them.
The Democrats decided to “resist and obstruct”
“And you see it in the last four days,” he added, saying, “that the Democrats are angry and evil and disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate's judicial committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud sounding of the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you bring the document?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen -
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse trend of opinion.
It is intolerant of those who express their views
When activists from Momenta voted in my local side for my reminder, it was no surprise.
After all, I was the last of a number of Labour MPs to whom they said they were not welcome - because they honestly said their opinion.
My colleagues from the parliament treated Joan Ryan the same way, because she resolutely stood up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In a statement on Friday’s Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East, it was written that “we want the meetings to be accessible and productive.”
Most of the eight years I was a local member of parliament as a Labour party were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, the majority of the meetings today do not take place, and the promise “beloved, more kind; politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun with it.”
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for the Party’s leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. The colleagues I had previously thought we had similar political views were suddenly expecting me to turn 180° and hold positions that I would not otherwise agree with - whether it be a national security or an EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - then there follows the tirada of social networking, where they call for my appeal, condemn the policy of the center, and tell me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a wave of sexist or racist insults every day, but never give up.
One aspect of this era of politics that I am most disappointed with is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the diverse trend of opinion, and with every proposal to express distrust or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I have been advised many times to stay back, not to say so much, and then “I’ll be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who had let my class of general school literally fall apart, I have been trying to fight for better public services for those most in need - whether as a local councillor or as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my policy at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only say that when a country clashes towards a Brexit that harms households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not intended for the Moment in Nottingham, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of appeal or political pragmatism will discourage me from acting according to what I think is the best interest of you all.
Chris Leslie is Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr rises to the top
The two late fives have distorted the final result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazingly fun game Tennent's Premiership.
Now they are at the forefront of the table, like the only unbreakable.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of chances, which helped domestics to win, and coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been through big trials in our matches and we’re still unbreakable, so I have to be happy,” she says.
Robyn Christie of Melros says: “All the honor of Ayra, they took chances better than we did.
The five Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Roy Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of numerous supremacy, and Jason Baggot won an unaltered five.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayra by a penalty, and then accurately in the half-time he scored and transformed the solo experiment, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's five, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who left the pitch on the stretchers, and when the game began again, Ayr jumped again thanks to the five of Stafford McDowall, who was transformed by Climo.
The representative captain Ayra Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose used the player again thanks to the unaltered five Bruce Colvina after a brief strong pressure.
However, they returned home, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking Clima without a ball, MacPherson from a penalty ranking laid the ball behind the advancing maul Ayra.
Climo changed, from the very beginning, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregory Henry's wing for the fifth home.

Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be moving to the hospitality industry, and it was found that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Sixty-nine-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays on a popular BBC show, which he writes and plays together with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last series of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the extract from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but the source of the Scottish Sun newspaper indicated that Kiernan wanted to engage in “a prosperous business in restaurants” in Glasgow.
\"The sea is ours: Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors guard in front of the Naval Command in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
Over public buildings is a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca for Amazon are described by the slogan: “The sea is ours rightly.
It is our duty to obtain it -
There is still a living memory of the coast that the country lost in favor of Chile in the bloody 19th-century war for resources, as well as the desire to re-brake the Pacific Ocean.
These aspirations may be the largest in a few decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice, which should fall on 1 October after five years of negotiation.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive result,” said Bolivia’s diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the MSD on large screens across the country with the hope that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of the Bolivian claim that, after many decades of interrupted talks, Chile is required to discuss Bolivia providing sovereign access to the sea.
The charismatic native president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who has a controversial battle to re-elect next year, is also very interested in Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for the benefit of Bolivia - and even if it did, much would not change.
This United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to implore any Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that MSD’s decision comes only six months after recent arguments were made shows that the case “was not complicated,” says Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
And for the last four years, not only did they support Bolivia, but it may have stopped it.
“The issues of access to the sea have been seized by the existing Bolivian government,” says Zarate.
He adds that Morales’s attack rhetoric has weakened all the remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will once again act, but after this it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring a “exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with each other’s benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also declined that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would still use the question of the sea as a political barrel.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“A judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless the U.S. can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first unless it can trust Washington
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to make promises on the summit of leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the nuclear diplomacy that has been stuck at a dead point for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is \"crying hope - that the ongoing sanctions and objections of the U.S. against the declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes hit the North on its knees.\"
Washington is cautious about consenting to the declaration, unless Pyongyang first makes significant steps to disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning this arsenal, which the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris shows show that the latest trend of huge head covers will soon arrive in your fashion stores
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of capped huge head covers for their Spring/Summer 2019 collection at a show that captivated everyone at the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
Valentina’s exhibition piece was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge resembling the feathers that flooded the model’s heads.
Other excessively large accessories were decorated with melons, witch hats and even pineapples - but they are not intended to warm up the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment even with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a root with a sweaty ice cream.
And if you continue with great fashion, you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could also arrive at fashion stores.
Overgrown hats come after \"La Bomba - a straw with half a meter wide creme, which was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded social media, sent another huge creation to the show pier - a straw beach bag, which is almost as large as the model in the swimwear that carries it.
The dark orange rim bag lined with rafi shakes and fitted with a white leather handle was on Paris Fashion Week an exhibition piece of the La Riviera Spring/Summer 2019 collection from Jacquemuse.
Celebrities stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for the next summer - given that the designer had such a great success with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessively large accessories -
John Edward: Language skills are a must for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic successes and this continues in 2018 with other excellent test results. Individual and group successes in sports, art, music and other community activities only underscore this.
These schools have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and strive to provide their pupils and parents with the best possible level of service.
Independent schools prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually customized school education plans, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, he goes directly into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, he goes straight to his heart.
It is a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
The latest results of this year’s exams show that languages are in the top of the tables, with higher levels of success having independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language achieved the best signs of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that the highest mark A reached 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and youth will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subjects chosen by pupils are equally respected in the study plans of independent and other schools as in STEM (science, technology, technical disciplines and mathematics).
The survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17% of language skills are inadequate due to the reasons that employers report as problems in taking up jobs.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future that you have such a lifelong skill.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks multiple languages will automatically gain an advantage before the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them failed to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, namely 15%, being French.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children learn more languages, especially languages that develop economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school differs by what languages it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have a choice in independent schools of several languages with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what they expect in the future.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages are essential in the global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered “International communication skills”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will appear in Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers will be waiting soon.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in a Sunday's opening game of the pre-season in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
It is unclear how many minutes it will take.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told Lakers.
Lakers Reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season matches,” he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaign performances in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including friendly stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote to confirm his candidate for a free seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to get support for the upcoming elections in half of the mandate, as Republicans are facing the risk of losing Congress in November’s elections.
At what time does Trump’s performance begin tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump Assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 East Time, today on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia online below by live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about hearing a candidate to the Supreme Court of Brittany Kavanaugh, which took place this week and was very tense due to allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior.
But the main goal of this wave of meetings is to help Republicans gain pace before the November elections.
According to Reuters, campaign organizers, President Trump said that these five meetings next week aim to “add energy to volunteers and supporters so Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.”
“Controlling the Senate is so important for his agenda that the president will go to as many countries as possible in this busy season of campaigns,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from \"Ohia and Pennsylvania\" could come to the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling to watch the media from Pittsburgh.
On Saturday it will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, in which he won more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“For Morriseye, it is not a good sign that he must come to help him in surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at Westvirgin University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows that stomach fight to keep hope ahead of Sunday singles
After three unilateral matches, Saturday’s couple can be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really believe it, and most of all it is in such competitions.
So where's the pendulum going now?
“They took six points, and now it’s four, so we take it that the pendulum is probably moving a little towards us,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, leads by four points, and there are twelve more.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a little wind in the sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, for example, the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and everyone can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly when he switched from fire to green and goes by example.
The famous screams were still amplified in the continuation of his round, when he managed a key pat to win the whole match when they were with Tomas two holes behind.
His putt, who won them a 15 hole match, met a similar scream telling you that the American team is not out yet.
“You really had to go deep and take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all each of these players left behind.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange, but adorable couples from Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
\"Moliwood was the only couple who didn't hit the hole on Saturday afternoon, but also spent Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning.
The course and the way the energy flows towards both the stormy audience and from it confirms that these are the players intended for Sunday's victory, and that by sunset over Le Golf Naitional will not be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It is best both at the same time to a different hole.
But speaking of European fame remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning game with four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The hole and the two dables buried Spain and Sweden on the front nine to the abyss, from which they did not climb.
No one will help you on Sunday.
The games of two pairs on two balls are so fascinating when you closely follow the interactions of people in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has taken a significant lead by the last day, but this two-player game has also shown that the US team has a stomach for the struggle some, especially from the states, have doubted.
By the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe has a score of 10-6 points.
Europe will gain a healthy advantage by the last day of the Ryder Cup, then from Saturday games pairs to two balls came out with a lead of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly twice won over the fighting Tiger Woods, decided to do four gear at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the morning games on two balls with the American side that failed in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, winning two matches, but they couldn’t get into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's party needs eight points from Sunday's 12 matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who, after the sensational weekend, were nicknamed Molliwood, are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After the defeat of Woods and Patrick Reed in the game for two balls and then they beat tired Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in the game pairs on two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting after a two-ball game in the morning, returned to his partner, Henri Stenson, in the 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopepka.
Europe, however, did not have this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris won on the whole line.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas broke two points for Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game on two balls and returned later to defeat the pair Poulter and Roy McIlroy 4&3 in the game pairs, although the first two holes lost.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a double-game, although as the advocating Fury's party only needs a draw to win a trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems that there is a Sunday counterattack behind them.
North Korea says it “will not be armed unilaterally and without confidence.”
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that the UN’s ongoing sanctions have deepened their distrust of the United States and under such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken \"significant measures of goodwill - such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, disassembly of nuclear test sites and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.\"
“But we don’t see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
\"Without trust in the United States, trust in our national security will not come, and under such circumstances it is impossible to unilaterally disarm ourselves.\"
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to \"progressive - approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every gradual step, his statement seemed significant in that it did not refuse unilateral denuclearization only because it had already passed through Pyongyang in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on \"the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\" while Trump promised North Korea's security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 war conflict, but the United States said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted the challenges of releasing tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure on sanctions to force its targets, and even oppose the ‘declaration of the end of war’,” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea and not the U.S. were part of this issue, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come into such a pathological situation.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from that of last year's UN General Assembly that the focus of North Korea's missiles on U.S. territory was inevitable after \"Mr. evil president - Trump called Kim a \"missile man\" on a suicide mission.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action to disarm, but said much work must still be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is fully denuclearized.
Trump said Wednesday that he has no time frame for this, saying: “If it lasts two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that: “The enforcement of the UN Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and uninterruptedly until we are aware of the complete, final, verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea in order to suppress the funding of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly, and Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and declared that progress had been made only to declare that North Korea was in a matter of hours that it was in \"Gangster's demands.\"
North Korea has pledged to meet Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes “corresponding measures”
He said Kim announced that \"the appropriate measures he hopes to take are the security guarantees Trump has promised in Singapore and is aiming to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course to teach them enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year prompted all its students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of macho study throughout the night, when students do not sleep and encourage themselves with caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he lectured about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this only now, in my last year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,\" he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students the basic information on how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Services at the University, said the university decided to introduce a course after finding out that students were really sleepless during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of student tracks where students click on cups with coffee, curtains, sneakers and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of the right sleeping habits.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - as well as you have the right to know the effects of smoking on health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in \"studies all night\" - still exists, added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of lack of sleep is increasing.
A sufficient amount of sleep of good quality should be \"secret weapons - a student to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety,\" he said - even in order not to gain gain, because sleep deprivation switches the brain to starvation mode, so that a person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that was attended by one of his classes in Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the whole course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting an alarm for the time when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of \"blue light - emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can decide your circadian rhythm, which leads to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal sank Gerrard's man
Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy was hit by Steven Gerrard’s dissatisfaction with the defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox party tried to record its first victory from February 4 to 1 at St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team caused only the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as a manager to leave his post eight points from leading leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers lineup seemed uninspired and determined to balance.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and immediately behind the Hibernian team as opposed to one goal.
And there could be other Rangers issues after the bar judge Calum Spence had to be treated with head injury after the object apparently hit him from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side that moved around Ayr to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who last week collected the Hearts point and would be happy how his well-trained team suffocated his opponent at every turn.
Rangers may have mastered possessions, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score only two minutes after Menga first let Scott Pittman on the Allan McGregor goal, but the midfielder buried his big chance.
The remote free kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the back post.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope in the last third than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should be fined for a quarter-hour lead when they collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson put the Colombian challenge out of the table.
Rangers managed only two missiles to target in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassana Coulibala and the short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener could have been against the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it already.
Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' deep set.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Dallas sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Menga to the easy finish.
Gerrard took action at the break and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost immediate results when the wing fell into Morelosa, but the impressive Kelly fought from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett metal one long ball after the other.
Holt's party may have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor was well placed to block Jacobs before Litgow ran from the corner.
Rangers Rangers Glenn Middleton had another late claim for punishment when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of Geiger's Reader
And now the page from our almanac “The Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and it is still increasing... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans-Geiger” was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactiveity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger Counter became a permanent pop culture at the time, as in the 1950 film \"Bells of Coronado - the main role of those seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: \"It's Geiger's reader that's used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of radioactive atoms in minerals.
Evans: \"Oh, yeah, now it's really cracking --
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to \"see\" dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to \"see - dangerous cells and kill them\"
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extraction of immune cells from the patient and their conversion in the laboratory
Then they can \"see\" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells has missed ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so they can \"see\" a protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-used into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “directs the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer,” explains Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and \"teached - is to focus on cancer cells, has already been promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West took part in a pro-Trump sermon, in his maga hat, after his performance on the SNL.
It didn't work very well.
Kanye West was featured in Saturday Night Live studio after a confused performance, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After falling asleep on the third song that evening called Ghost Town, in which Make America Great Again was wearing his hat, he began to swim on the Democrats and repeated his support of President Trump.
“I’m talking to the whites, and they say, ‘As much as you can like Trump, he’s a racist.’
“If I were to mind racism, I wouldn’t have been in America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL launched a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead role in which the Hollywood star made fun of the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate's court committee on the allegation of rape by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's theater speech footage was recorded on social media by a comic book by Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to laugh at West.
West also complained to the viewers that he had received his ornament of his head to eat well in the back.
“I was bullied in the back.
They said, “Don’t go there with that hat.”
That's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place,\" Examiner said.
West continued: \"You want to see the wrong place - and added that he would \"put on his superman suit, because that means you can't tell what to do - you want the world to move forward?
Try Love -
His comments earned only the buzzing of the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL looked aggravated, embarrassed, says Variety, and one person even said, \"The whole studio was completely quiet.\"
Westa was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many of them by singing the song I Love dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leading conservative group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest characters: thank you for taking the Dava.
But the guest talk show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was \"just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing.\"
“But I NECHCI reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) about which I believe he represents and broadcasts to the world of ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us, she added.
Prior to the performance, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now “formally known as Kanye West”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly called Snoop Lion and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant should face trial in Belfast on Monday.
The charges raised shall be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington embarked on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with the sword in hand in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
However, the actor, 31 years old, got out of the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be claimed to earn respect.
The newspaper The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he believes that \"something is wrong - and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his star Star on the thrones of Rose Leslie, also admitted 31 that he was “strongly involved in this problem.”
\"At this point, I personally feel quite strongly - what happened so badly with masculineity,\" he said.
“What do we teach teenage men about the problem we see here now?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What does the boys learn on TV, on the streets, from them the feeling that every man needs to have such a side?
I think this is really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because the young man certainly changed something for the worse.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel Game of Thrones after completing the series, because he already has enough “fights and horses.”
Since November, Kit will play in Sam Shepard’s restored Right West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose for the best of the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in the series, so he gave me my future family and my entire subsequent life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this fantasy series award-winning Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the plots of Leslie's family house in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official numbers, more than 820 000 people are affected by this virus.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who infected with HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people year-on-year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions come from insufficient sexual protection in these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of an effort to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that personnel would let the GOP Senators’ data escape, resorting to the terms “hazardous lies” and “conspiracy theory”
On Saturday, U.S. MP Maxine Waters condemned the claim that a member of her staff had sent personal data to the Wikipedian legislators of three Republican U.S. senators.
A Los Angeles Democrats said the charges were supported by “ultra-racist scientists and websites.”
“Lie, lie and other detestable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. senators, Lindsay Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on charges of sexual abuse by a candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that sources posts are associated with Waters and published information about Waters staff members, Hill says.
“This unfounded claim is a completely false and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
\"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were threatened as a result of these fraudulent and false charges - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is an absolutely false and absolute lie.
Waters’ statement quickly earned online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
\"This suggests that he does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.\"
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't get angry.
It must not be resistive.
They should not question the applicant’s motives.
He must be calm and not be excited.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the critics of the Democrats to judge Kavanaugh, who they criticized because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it were true, it would be something,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said its office had notified “the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed,” she continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Reinterprets Review: Rowan Atkinson’s weaker spy parody
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British tendency, which seems to be the case of this re-enlivence of Johnny English in the series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this greasy satire be on the topic of how obviously a bad nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this skewed, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to re-pack things in a completely new way - this name more than anything else signaled that there is a wide comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking cinematographic audience.
He, of course, is the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre demands on smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch from Mr. Bean, and a big piece of that guy who set the only tone in the sound of Chariots of Fire at the Olympics opening ceremony in London 2012.
The character is also originally based on the traveler and international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, and which left chaos behind.
In this last edition, there are one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor, and the rotor blade was short on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially when \"serious-film brands like 007 and Mission Imposible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like being intended for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy trampoes are as ingenious and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gagas in Mr. Bean’s person.
The current assumption is that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrated a British super-secret web network of spyes and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to scare the agent in service - a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and biased figure who already suffers under the complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson, this would like Theresa May to play the character as best as possible, but there is nothing in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that once every active spy is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
That is, Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury facility, but at the same time gives a record lesson on how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English went back to Whitehall for an emergency checkout and met his former long-suffering partner, Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the submarine commander, an affected character, who may even waste some time with Vicki Pepperdine's talent.
So Batman and Robin are back in action in packing tasks for her Majesty's secret services and meet with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British cyber crimes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of frascious patches: masked as waiters, they light up a French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on the deck of Volt's luxury yachts; and English will trigger pure anarchy when they try to use virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of Volt's house.
All the aces are certainly ready for this last sequence, but whatever she is kind and turbulent, she has something on her child's TV.
A pretty moderate matter.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Laborists deny that they would develop a plan for Englishmen to work four days a week to get paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is due to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company’s bosses to pass on savings to workers resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would still receive the same reward.
The sources say that this idea would “fit” into the economic agenda of the party and plan to propel the country to the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A long-term Labour member told the Sunday Times: “It is expected that the evaluation of this measure will be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits into the party’s attitudes to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not currently approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: “The four-day working week is not our party’s policy and the party doesn’t take it into account.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the conference last week to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from \"anonymous directors\" and \"significants\" in utility companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders in water companies may not return to their total share, because the Labour government could carry out “controversies” on the basis of perceived guilt.
He also confirmed plans to place workers in the corporate board of directors and create own-owned funds that transfer 10% of private equity to employees entitled to pay annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, said on the show, “60 minutes - whether FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.”
The FBI has delayed its last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the Office's findings could swing some Republican senators in the pursuit of their support.
In an interview with Sunday's \"60 Minutes,\" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open than his South Carolina colleague.
\"I mean, of course,\" Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened when the charges came out, and he said, \"You did it.\"
He was determined, determined, clear.
Graham’s decision is unshakeable.
“I’ve already made my decision to do so, and it would really be an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
\"And none of those whom she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I can't see anything changed -
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what did it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York City, offering a very impressive range of stars and an equally impressive mission to the end of world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Powerty project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, email to the world leader, telephone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before he reached his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really the way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called \"clickivism\" - people who feel that by signing an online petition or sending a tweet will change something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
He says these actions have contributed to global leaders notifying more than $37 billion in commitments and measures to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that secured funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the UK’s investor and implementer partnerships, which committed to “helping children grow into their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens, like you, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of malnutrition in history,” project ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and the movement against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is one of the performers of this year’s New York year’s Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to \"block\" the Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to channel energy just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern abdomen of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the opportunity to use our Navy to make sure the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocked to make sure that their energy is not going to the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is considered to be “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less an investment in or replacement of fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “unified player” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes because the Trump administration is on a mission to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replaced the Russians, which for European consumers is a much cheaper option.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “manufacturer-Moscow.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims Washington’s ferocious resistance to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure development and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States took a stand from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s largest industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US to avoid EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state is intervening in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to “look closely at the presidential candidacy in 2020,” Senator of Massachusetts says.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in the middle of the parliamentary term, she was “closely looking at the candidacy for the president.”
During a meeting of the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including top women’s positions,” Hill said.
“After November 6th, I will look closely at the presidential candidacy,” he said.
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m afraid of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: \"Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote -
The poll, published Thursday, showed that most of Warren’s voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” voters from Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against her.
Other high-ranking democratic names discussed in the context of a potential candidacy by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin to meet Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year on the list in Iraq in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through after his return may refer to other families that experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries with which our soldiers are returning,” she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest “an elephant in the room” and said about her son and other war veterans that “they come back a little different, they come back to the balance, they come back and ask if there is any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the army, gives their country.
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence attacking a woman, intervening in a report on domestic violence and holding weapons drunk, said Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla police department.
18 countries, D.C. supports the call for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal call for new measures by the U.S. government to vampire asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts in Washington on Friday issued a brief report to support asylum seekers and challenge these measures, NBC said.
The full name of the prosecutor in the case of Grace v. Sessions, who filed in August the Organization of American Civil Liberties against federal politics was not revealed.
She said her partner “and his sons and members of the violent gang abused her, but U.S. officials refused to apply for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The Grace-backed states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemalans, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing ubiquitous gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the decision of the 2014 Immigrants Board of Appeal, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. said in a statement Friday that the new measure “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” he said.
The lawyers further briefly argued that a policy that denies the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy and says it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and \"add the necessary work\"
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” he said in a statement.
Asyl was never intended to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Pala, where the number of victims has already doubled, are racing to find survivors with time
The situation was getting worse and worse for the survivors.
“It’s very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusum, who comforted her hot boy in an evacuation center in the eccentric city of Pala.
“Every minute an ambulance brings more bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, choosing through the wetted things and trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that were destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake were affected.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rested at Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued strong subsequent shocks.
His tears filled his eyes when he depicted the feeling that the violent earthquake shook the hotel rooms on the fifth floor that shared the room with his wife and daughter.
“It wasn’t time to save yourself.
I think I was pulled into the wall's ruins,\" Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
Maybe they're all right -
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the American daily, which dealt with the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump said last Wednesday about China Daily’s paid extra charge in the Des Moines register, the state of Iowa’s largest sales newspaper, after he accused China of trying to mix in U.S. congressional elections on November 6.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election marked what U.S. officials said that Reuters was a new phase of Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that is manifested at the level of mutual imports.
China's retaliatory sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion on Sunday in the Des Moines Register that China is now doubling this bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American valuable tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Unlike a newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you’ll find limited dissenting voices and you won’t see any real reflection of disparate views that the Chinese might have on China’s disturbing economic path, given that the media belongs to the company “China’s Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers refused to publish an offer, even though he didn’t say which newspaper.
Republicans leave their voters in front of the election due to a debacle with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
How many top Republicans are defending a candidate for the Supreme Judge, Bretta Kavanaug, who faces several charges of sexual assault, the analyst warned that during the upcoming elections they will know the response, especially from women.
Emotions around this case were extremely high, and most Republicans on the record already say they want to continue voting.
“These things cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon) would last minute seek FBI investigations to calm the voters.
\"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and even in November,\" said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, a newspaper in D.C. on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted, “The letter is approaching, in a demonstration in the hall of the Senate, where Republicans who are in charge of the judicial committee decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony,” Mic said.
“Democrat enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say it’s been high, that’s true.
However, this could be higher, especially among the hesitant women’s voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old who don’t like the president, but often don’t go to the election.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court’s candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans were confirmed, she could follow the resistance.
“He’s been in a confused mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about voting in the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the table, it’s also about how Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, U.S. priority director, a group that helps vote for Democrats, pointing to the news channel.
However, Americans look somewhat divided in the opinion of whom to believe in the light of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, with somewhat more sympathy for the second named.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake's FBI, he is currently investigating charges filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate court committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had drunk her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court’s candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet and overtake Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s Open Source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the goal of Inrupt is “world domination”
“We have to do it now,” he said of this startup.
\"It's a historic moment -
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” - or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is exceptional about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls this “personal authorization through data”
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s goal is to bring resources, processes and relevant skills to help Solid be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the employees working on the project collaborated on the project and community of voluntary programmers.
Since this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on Inrupt websites.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
\"We do not ask for their permission -
Berners-Lee wrote in a statement on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based website.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in discussing network neutrality.
Berners-Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Spiritual who received the Victorian Cross during World War I
There have been celebrations for hundreds of years since the only spiritual Church of England won the Victorian cross as a warrior during World War I.
Vice-Chairman Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandsons revealed a memorial stone to him in Rushden on Saturday, Northamptonshire.
One of his great-grandfathers, Michael Vann, said it was “genially symbolic” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s winning performance.
According to the London Journal, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battleship through Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense fog and strong shooting from field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he got into the first line and with “the highest courage” he led the line forward than he threw himself into the fire field and knocked three separate units.
Lieutenant Vanna killed the German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never be able to do, but at the same time something that is humiliated.”
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, after the show led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band youth group, they laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said that “he felt great honor that he could take part in the show,” adding that “the starship of the true hero is manifested by the support that a lot of people will provide.”
MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa piglet instead
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied the main event.
The San José account included 13 points, including six on the main card, and live broadcasts took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other’s match, the audiences in the UK remained astonished when the news turned into a show about Peppa’s piglet.
Some of them remained uneasy after waking up until early morning due to the match.
One of the Twitter fans described the change in the broadcast to a children's show as \"a form of a bad joke.\"
“According to the government regulation, at 6 a.m., such content is not appropriate, and it is therefore necessary to broadcast children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator after being asked about this transmission.
\"Pepp's little boy, yes.
Bellator’s president Scott Coker said they would work on the program so that viewers in the UK would be involved in the future.
“I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it,” Cooker said.
“But there’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can’t do it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of textuals went back and forth and not all were just friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't, the government was responsible.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We're reducing it to five games instead of six - as we normally do - and we've tried to keep the promise to the fans with all our strength, and we didn't succeed.
It's an unfortunate situation -
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “minorly” because of sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to go for success.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize until he joined high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On the first disc, Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, introduced by Lauren Laverne, said he spoke out loud about the rights of gays to give other \"hopefuls\"
He also said that thanks to the possibility of becoming parents, he was less interested in winning at the Olympics.
The regular moderator of Kirsty Young’s long-term program had several months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a paratrooper in Laverne’s first program, said he felt “less valuable than anyone else who grew up with him at the same time, because “it was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls.”
He said, “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and the differentness of the real thing that gave me strength and power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, not to disappoint anyone who could possibly find out how his sexuality was.
The two-time bronze Olympic medal holder has become a high profile LGBT rights fighter and has used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to give others “hope.”
This three-time world champion said that he was in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “he hit the unprepared”
Daley took the owner of Oskar, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age, he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later of cancer,” he said, “it was not easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Next’s son in June, and Daley said that he “has changed his entire perspective.”
“If you asked me last year, it would be all in the style of ‘I want to get a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t say he was going to die, and the last thing he asked was if he had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in front of them.
“I couldn’t tell him, you’re not going to be first, Dad,” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not irreconcilable,” he said.
The year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew I’d been dreaming about it all my life,” he said, “to jump in front of our home at the Olympics.
It also inspired the selection of his first song, The Flow by Heather Small, which resonated with him at the beginning of the Olympics, and continued to create a thick skin in it.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, finished on a bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson would record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup match, but he would have to tune the form to prevent it from being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who played at events held every two years for a record of the twelfth, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the bench on Saturdays and Foursoms.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as was often the case in the U.S., the five-time main winner spent his day alternatingly between the Cheerleaders and the work of the game in a row he hoped to fix what was troubled him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, not even at the top of his career, so he is not the perfect choice for a narrow field of Le Golf National, where long broken terrain routinely punishes lost shots.
And if the golf course is not very worrying in itself, Mickelson faces the exact British Open Francescu Molinari in his ninth Sunday match, who won all four of his matches this week with newbie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who had four fewer points, had launched 12 separate swords, had escaped the rapid onset, the Mickelson sword could have proved to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man and did not add anything else.
“He totally understands the role he had today, he was crying me around his back, he gave me his hand around his shoulders, and he said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“They believe so much.
He is a member of the Straw Hall, and in the past and this week he has been so beneficial to these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine playing two cats.
I imagined more, but that's how it evolved and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.
Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record in most of the Ryder Cup's Wests on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his team’s presence has produced some intangible results.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great companion in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed the fun when they followed him, this week, which was fun to watch.
It gives much more than just a game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the great leadership heading into singles from the last days at the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane debuted at the 1997 match in Valderram, where the team led by Captain Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they got to the finish line with a completely tight victory of 141-2-131-2.
“You have to keep in mind that we had a big lead in Valderram, as well as in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only close,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching 5-3 win on Friday and yesterday in 2018, in order to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of the team showed me that it's not behind us.
Tomorrow you'll be totally bored.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all those points are on the board.
We have a goal and that's how we try to get the trophy and we're focusing on it.
I said I'm going to focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand up for on the other side - the best players in the world -
Bjorn, pleased with how his players performed on a complex golf course, added: “I would never have done it myself.
A different animal awaits us tomorrow.
We are preparing individual performances tomorrow and that’s too hard.
It’s great to be out with your partner when it goes well, but when you’re there to be behind yourself, your golf player’s capacity is fully verified.
This is the message you have to give to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will take care of his players to play better as individuals than as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these major twists when he was part of a winning team in Brooklin to end up being defeated when Europe reached “The Miracle in Medinah”
“I remember every damn word,” Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, answered, “and encouraged his players to head to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklin as in Medinah.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts considerable pressure on the middle games.
That's how we set up the line-up and make sure the boys feel like you know, as if we were going to spell out tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead a counter-attack and stand up to Roy McIlroy in a top match with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“I went with that group of boys in this order, because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn said of his choice of singles.
German new warship re-deposited
The latest German frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least one more year due to faulty systems and snowy coast, local media said.
\"Rheinland-Pfalz - a brand new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class - was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit.
The ship was to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems after the delivery made the fate of this ambitious project uncomfortable.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will serve as a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates, which had already been ordered by the Navy in 2007.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include a long maintenance period - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside of home ports.
However, constant delays mean that high-end naval ships, which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas, will be obsolete until launch, says Die Zeit.
The famous F125 frigate came into the newspaper last year when the German Navy officially refused to bring the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturers after handing over.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of major \"software bugs and defects on metal elements - defects, due to which the warship would be unusable in the fight.
Software defects were particularly significant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessel will operate a crew of some 120 sailors - half of the workers needed on the Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship has a significant excess weight, which reduces its performance and reduces the ability of the Navy to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfal ship will be twice as heavy as the class-like ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defects on metal elements, the cost of the entire project is also a problem - including training of the crew.
It is said that from the original €2.2 billion, the price rose to €3.1 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates have gained significance especially in the light of recent warnings that German maritime power is falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German Parliament, confirmed that the naval army was “coming ships capable of deploying.”
The official said the problems had been continuously packed because the old ships were decommissioned, but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates could become part of the Navy's equipment.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
At the habitat of bats in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being conducted to reveal how bats use the landscape in the hunt for food.
There is hope that research findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help manage future activities to preserve this species.
The study, conducted by National Trust for Scotland scientists, will track bats of starvation and the smallest and brown long-lasting and water in the Invere Gardens botanical garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas in this bat site, which will monitor the activities of bats throughout the year.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings detects the frequency of the call of bats and what individual species do.
A Habitat Map and Report will then be released to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, an Advisor for the conservation of natural resources for NTS, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the formation of meadows, and the best procedure for maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
The bats of the population in Scotland and the entire UK are falling a lot in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and territorial development that affects colonies and the natural environment.
The risk may also be wind turbines and lighting, as well as pastes on flies and chemical treatment of building materials as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting for prey.
They use an ingenious echo-location technique to track the buglets and obstacles in the flight.
NTS, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, controls of colonies and sometimes rescue work.
This organization even set up the first and only reserved bat reservation at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
Manager David Thompson says this is an ideal area for them.
“We have a great area for bats here in Threava,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's still too much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.
It emphasizes the importance of bat control before starting maintenance work in real estate, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one mother’s nest can kill up to 400 females and adolescents, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them, or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put her hand on the work and help.
She said: “We have a lot to learn about our bats and many species that we don’t know about, how their populations are doing,” she said.
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and his lawyers intend to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape as “false news” and said people “want to see it by using its name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, who reported these charges.
This Portuguese and Juventus attacker was charged with rape by the American woman Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep her silent about the case, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the publication of the allegation, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers and called the information “false news”
“No, no, no, no, no.
“What they said today is fake news,” said the five-time gold ball winner.
“They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their work.
“I’m happy and I’m fine,” the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald’s lawyers are about to accuse Der Spiegel of unfounded allegations, which they have called “unacceptable notice of suspicion in the private area.”
A lawyer, Christian Schertz, said the player would demand compensation for \"moral damage equivalent to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights recently -
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Las Vegas Casino.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the game room, where she was reportedly raped by a file file filed at a court in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo had bowed down after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent” of the “lost” and “one percent” failed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police to take pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she “was afraid of retaliatory,” and was afraid of “public humiliation.”
A 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to restore the proceedings because she is still traumatized by the alleged incidents.
Ronalda, at the time of the charge of attacking the steps from the transfer to the Real Madrid club from Manchester United and this summer, bought it for 100 million euros by the famous Italian Juve club.
Brexit: UK Will Regret the Loss of Car Manufacturers Forever
The UK will “permanently regret” if it loses its status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary of State Greg Clark.
He added that he was “disturbing” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“The deal is necessary,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of a delay at the border, if no Brexit deal is concluded, could cost jobs.
At a plant in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis cars of Toyota are produced, they produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would have seen a stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, in the UK, are spreading the fear of leaving the EU without an agreement when it comes to the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini car manufacturing plant in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers call risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on the basis of “right-to-time” deliveries, with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU being delivered to cars manufactured on order within 37 minutes.
If the UK left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be border disruption, which could lead to delays and lack of spare parts, according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, thus stopping production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plans to reinvigorate future relations with the EU were \"exactly calibrated to avoid these border controls.\"
“We need an agreement. We want to have the best store that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the grasp of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run it warns that the costs added would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the chairman of trade unions in the race, said that the members of the trade union are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places are gone, they will never return.
The government spokesperson said: \"We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU -
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with a representative attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be “deposited another week” because he continues to fight for the post of Supreme Judge with Brette Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is looking into the work of Robert Mueller’s special council to investigate the interferences in the Russian elections, the ties between Trump’s affiliates and Russia, and the possible judicial obstructions by the president.
Whether Trump releases a representative attorney general and threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's quilts have been full for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of setting up a president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said Rosenstein would “do not let go, but then the meeting was delayed not to interfere with a hearing at the Senate’s court committee, where Kavanaugh’s testimony and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI weekly investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday in news on Fox's channel.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, it may be necessary to move for another week with respect to everything else that takes place in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always tell the news to the media --
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not caused by an aversion to \"the divadéle - the TV reporters, even though she said, \"I do not agree with the fact that she will perform -
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him,” she added, without giving any evidence.
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but “if the representatives of the press had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
We're trying it and you've seen that we've been doing it in the last few weeks and there's going to be a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president has probably shown why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre look before the reporters gathered.
Health Minister writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The Ministry of Health has written to EU workers working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter not even six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to handling the costs of requests for settlement of EU citizens who work in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in a letter: “Through the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU are continuing on their departure, and they are heading towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the UK government is also taking action to prepare for a possible non-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to assure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
EU-wide and non-EU colleagues bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit both patients and the communities we provide services to.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our warm wish is that you stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
The deported Tigers defender from Tennessee Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday’s 31-27 defeat from Vanderbilt Commodores’ opponent, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and health professionals gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline and then put it on the carrier and prepared for further assessment.
A Tennessee-state official told Chrisz Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of the type/range of injury are yet available and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the second in the red T-shirt, completes the first season for the state of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday, he had five overall interventions, which means a total of 18 interventions in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher property tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher real estate tax when they buy real estate in the UK, with extra money being used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This action will neutralize Corby’s success in attracting young voters
Increased liability of higher property tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state Treasury is expected to increase by £120 million a year to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher property purchase tax when they buy a property in the UK, with extra money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May said today.
This action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with the promise to provide affordable accommodation and focus on high-income people.
The increase in property buying tax will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, while money will also strengthen government efforts to fight sleeping without a roof over the head.
A surcharge, which is an addition to the current obligation to pay property tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago for other houses and purchases for the purposes of rent, can reach up to three percent.
It is estimated that the state Treasury will increase the funds by up to £120 million per year.
Estimates say that newly built properties in London buy 13 percent of citizens who are not UK residents, driving prices and making it harder for those who buy for the first time to get home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital city, have become “spirit cities” precisely because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new rules appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in property buying tax to help more young people to their own first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding property prices high by taking up land, but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to repair “the enemy home” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an engaging series of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the end of \"disruptive\" evictions.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: \"I said last year that I want to put my efforts as prime minister to the restoration of the British dream - so that every new generation has a better life.
And that means correcting our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and shape life.
However, it can’t be right to make it easy for entities who don’t live in Britain and for foreign companies to buy homes as well as hard-working UK residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of their own home is too far away, and the shame of sleeping without a roof over their heads is too real.
Jack Ross: \"My highest ambition is to drive Scotland.\"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says he is his “highest ambition” to become Scotland’s manager at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scot is looking forward to the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which currently holds the third position in the First League, just three degrees below the top.
This summer, he moved to the Stadium of Light after taking back the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
“I got the rank B and it was,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a child, and that’s always something that draws me back.
But that would only come if I were successful in running the club.
Ross' predecessors were: Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former head of Alloa Athletic says he didn’t feel any anxiety about following such established names in such a big club when he had previously rejected pre-games from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success would be measured for me at the time if I could return to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him back there, but I’d probably feel successful if I could go back to the club.
Ross has only been in leadership for three years, previously acting as an auxiliary boss in Dumarton, and spent 15 months as a coach of Hearts.
He then helped the Alloa club recover from the descent to the third group and transformed St Mirren from starting decline to the champion of the title of the masters in the following season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he has ever had in his career players at Cyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he said, remembering the time when Alloa took over.
“I really believed leadership was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I was good, earning well and enjoying reasonable heights.
Playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through every week.
I'm still going through them from the point of view of the stress and the pressure of the job, but I'm just feeling good in leadership.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now I’m doing it, I feel like I’m feeling the most in my skin in my entire adult life.

Research has found that a great time on pint is on Saturday at 17:30
The summer wave of buckets increased the income of British pubs faced with difficulties, but increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, who created the final report, said: “Stable sunlight and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a formula similar to the previous June when pub traffic increased by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were even more affected.
The sales of restaurants decreased by 1.8 percent in June.
The pubs and bars entrenched in drinks have so far run the strongest as the restaurants have worsened.
Houses whose main sales are from food also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst at leisure and hospitality, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
The weather and influence of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the annual decline in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in the light of ongoing pressures on costs.
Long hot summer can’t be worse for food-loving business operators, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we’ve experienced in August will bring so much relief.
The overall growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffee Peach Tracker’s sales monitor for the UK’s pub, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with combined turnover over £9 billion, which is an established industrial scale in the industry.
Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks that hides from their parents
Every fifth child, aged just 11, has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and educators, shows research
Research among 20,000 high school pupils has shown an increase in “false Instagram pages”
News has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that their parents know about.
One in five children, aged just 11, create accounts in social networks that hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school pupils showed a rapid increase in “false Instagram accounts” in which photos are shared.
The reports point to concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a beautiful “main” account that their parents know about, while having a private account.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found that her teenager urged others to “rape me”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools has shown that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, half of whom admit to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the \"voice of athletes\" in the Scottish Athletic Committee.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as Executive Director at the annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most appreciated light athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in the management of sports as those for whom her far-reaching international experience will be useful over the past decade.
“Eilidh has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community, and we are confident that it will be very beneficial for athletics in Scotland when she is a member of the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I’m excited to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be really beneficial and to help lead sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won a total of four gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after a transitory ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors have said that only time will show whether I will heal or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've proved full healing, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing exercise!

Milk extractor causing mother comparison to cow shares views online
The company involved in the production of extractors divided online opinion by advertising, which compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
As part of its launch, “the world’s first silent wearable extractors,” Envi’s consumer technology company released a superstitious music video showing the freedom that the new pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with cows for a song with the text: \"Yes, I get it, but you don't see any tail - and \"If you haven't noticed that I don't have a venison, there are my breasts here -
The congregation continues: “Pump, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, triggered an online controversial response.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of whom reported that it sheds light on the “mountains” of the dairy industry.
“A very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising this product.
Just as we have to be pregnant and give birth so they can give milk, but their children are taken away from them a few days after giving birth,” says one of the comments.
The Elvie extractor is discreetly placed on the breastfeeding breast (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Intelligiblely traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them for advertising on breast pump for mothers who keep their children -
Someone else added: \"This advertisement is completely out of the way -
There were also those who defended advertising, and one woman admitted that she considered the song “infectious”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I kept breastfeeding.
I feel like a cow when I'm vacuuming.
Advertising is a little crazy, but it's a thing.
“It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
She added: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who take out milk (often at work or at the toilet) and feel like “the cows.”
It’s not advertising to praise or damn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all dance with discreet pumpes hidden under the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who take out milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie extractor is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses, and beautifully hides in the breast for breastfeeding, so it gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the baby and even when vacuuming to walk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, commented: “Elvie’s extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a significant and provocative launch on the market.
By creating parallels between nursing mothers and milk-feeding cows, we wanted to highlight the extraction of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing a fun and reliable sense of freedom that the new extractor will ensure.
It's not the first time that Elvie's pump has come to death.
During the London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski, who had just used the product, appeared on the pier.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained increased sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, especially because the hard rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most of the accompanying were traditionally made up of immigrants without documents who were afraid of threatening the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had applied for the status of escorts of lonely minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of those who are sponsors or members of a sponsor’s household are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we're continuing to prosecute them,\" said Mr. Albence.
According to asylum workers, officials are trying to process child-related matters more quickly introducing new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month before the detention, instead of earlier standard 60 days.
Many will appear through a video conference call instead of personally declaring their case legal status for immigration judges.
Those who are not entitled to assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely anxiety or depression occurs, which can lead to explosions of anger or attempts to escape, asylum workers say, and reports from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say these concerns are increased in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is losing, more likely to be unnoticed, just because of the size of the device.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends could cause trauma, which many children are already struggling with.
Syria says US, French and Turkish “occupying forces” are expected to withdraw immediately
During a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, although there is already an eighth year of war in the country.
Moual, who is also the prime minister, said foreign forces in Syria were illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that “this will be handled accordingly.”
“They must give up immediately and unconditionally,” he said.
Moualem insisted that \"the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over - with more than 360 000 people killed since 2011 and millions of others losing their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “a battle in this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and “any illegally present foreigners”
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria, mainly training Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 units in war-torn territory.
In issuing refugees, Moualem said there were good conditions of return for them and accused \"some Western countries - of \"proliferating irrational concerns\" that caused refugees not to return.
“We have addressed international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no recovery aid would be available to Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a protection zone in Idlib’s last refuge has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large attack by the Syrian forces in Russia on a province where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the deal had “clearly given final terms” and expressed the hope that the military intervention would be aimed at jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters, with a link to Al-Qaeda, who “will be eliminated.”
The U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to \"checking the articles of the existing constitution\" and issued a warning of intervention.
Why Trump Will Win in Second Period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would have won the next election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers likely hope, the prosecution and scandals had not given way to his office as president.
In this case, it would undoubtedly be \"the most dramatic finale of the presidential period in history\"
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, surveillance has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average follow-up of 2.4 million at the main broadcast time, an increase from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen and “The Rachel Maddow Show,” to MSNBC, has increased cable TV coverage to 3.5 million following major night news.
“It’s a heat that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, an operator of the program “Designed survivor” at ABC drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Chapter.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and show “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys”, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? asked
“He said, ‘Because it’s funny with him,’ said Mrs. Scovell.
It's the meaning of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, a story in Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wada, whether the families of immigrants can reconnect and in favor of the global economy.
Tuning is a luxury that only the most privileged followers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond whether you are an informed citizen when you are following a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses “deep backup” resources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s ostrich leather jackets worth $15,000 (“arrogance shielding”, as Washington Post said, and the consequences of the disgusting depiction of “anatomy” by Mr. Trump Stormy Daniels.
I’m not going to watch Super Maria the same way.
“Part of what he’s doing and what makes you feel like a reality show is that he feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of Pawn Stars’ paper on the rotating c N.F.L. Trump’s show, in which he is appreciated by Kim Jong-un.
You can't miss a single episode, otherwise you'll be behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny, out on the northern coast of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was stuck inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate's court committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was on fire.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’ said Mr. Fleiss.
“I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money flows from the outside into the tightest domestic races of the medium-term election
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a financial outflow thanks to the reorganization of congress districts, which generated two holders of the office in the fight for the same chair.
This has recently led to the transformation of the Pittsburgh suburban district by the District Democratic Republican Conor Lamb, which won another district in a special choice last spring.
Lamb opposes another office holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapd with the new 17th.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania issued an opinion in January that the old districts were unceasingly divided in favor of the Republicans, maps were redrawn.
The plant in the new 17th district started a sharp financial debate between the financial branches of the main party, the Democratic Campaignal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special elections to the 18th Congressional District.
This chair was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political experts give Democrats a slight lead.
America is considering fined Salvador for supporting China, then retreating
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under the moderate pressure of Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until his partners had been relocating the Trump leadership organizational team.
Foreign Ministry officials have decided to revoke U.S. diplomatic mission directors from Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the basis of “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” said a statement issued earlier this month.
But the fines were considered only against Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drugs control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included shortening financial assistance and focused on limiting visas, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With ongoing internal negotiations, North American and Central American high-level conference leaders focused on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which was viewed as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, the leaders made it clear that they wanted to continue the negotiations and effectively complete any fines considered for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now tasked with solving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of a signal put by the administration at the meeting, diplomats said.
And three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without having any new unbreakable news from Washington.
The White House spokesperson, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate that three U.S. officials described, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government executive and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History
Robert Mueller's special commission report on the possible defence of Mr Trump in the exercise of the law, which is now in public records, could be a definitive nail to the coffin.
Mr Mueller said in his investigation that Mr. Trump's campaign did not have a secret agreement with Russia on an attack on our elections.
Should there be an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to take responsibility before this authority, as well as re-prepare the electorate, and would eventually have been expected by a jury composed of his colleagues.
This is a whole range of “if, and I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable,” as with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to hold a coup against Hitler, enough to build and support the Western Powers in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years full of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that accelerate or slow the relentless course of democracy.
The Americans are now facing a few similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump throws out Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been busy since the report announced that he had proposed secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not in a state of health in order to hold the presidential office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, versions of The Times are inaccurate.
“How do we react if the newly requested F.B.I. Bretta Kavanaugh investigation is not complete or fair, or what if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of convincing allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?”
And most importantly, will we vote in the middle of the term of office for Congress, which will take responsibility for Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait a long dark night.
But I believe that we do not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me on the Sabbath to light candles on a table with swastika.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such a heritage?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about the encounter with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians would give them great hope of progress from the G European League after an impressive draw in Spain earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing on the pitch for the first time in the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal. However, they believe that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We went into a fight with the belief that we could grab something, and we took a point.
Perhaps we could multiply it at the end, but overall the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we improved and we were better again.
It will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be hard, because they've had a good result in the last game, but with the spectators behind my back, I'm sure we can push it down and it's going to go well.
Last year was pretty hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club, but now I feel very good about it.
The team is strong and the boys really enjoy it, training is good too.
I hope we'll stick to it now, throw the season behind our heads, and we'll be successful.
Women worry about pension savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the people in the national study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t want to discuss it with them,” explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
You can start this way.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for care unless you reveal your wishes in advance.
Together with your advisor and family, discuss where and how to receive care, because these factors can play a big role in determining the price.
Invite Your Financial Advisor: A Advisor can help you find a way to pay those expenses.
For example, long-term care can be financed using a traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid cash life insurance that will help you pay these expenses, or using your own insurance using your own funds - as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as you can.
Design your health care representative, which will be a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that doctors follow your wishes unless you can communicate yourself.
Also consider writing full power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who will take financial decisions for you and will ensure that your accounts are paid in case you are not eligible for it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your grandfather needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“In the game, they are not only finances, but, for example, what are called nursing doctors,” Martin asks.
“Where are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready at hand -
The man in Ilfracombe was shot several times from the airship
When the man came home on foot after a night's drag, he was hit by several air-tight missiles.
The 40-year-old victim was in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in her chest, belly, and hands.
Police described the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST, as a \"accidental act\"
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victims are not at risk of life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to continue to rise.
Since communication is out of operation, auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Donggala Regent, which is an area north of Pala, which is closer to the epicenter of earthquakes of 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the regent of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, and its population was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis struck.
Donggala is a regent stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the north-west island of Sulawesi.
Regents, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main components of the economics of the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
In the province, there is also significant mining of nickel, which is mainly concentrated in Morovali on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunami has hit Pala and Donggal several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami struck West Donggala in 1996, when she requested nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and there is a regular earthquake.
Here is a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of the Indonesian most populous island of Java and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have lost their lives.
2010: The 7.5 earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The light earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya Regent in Aceh Province and caused destruction and panic because it reminded people of the devastating effects of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was formed, but more than 100 died of falling buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake hit Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, for suspicions of domestic violence, violation of domestic violence reports, and the prevention of arrest.
When the police reportedly attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin has been sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held on an unsafe $500 bond, KTUU reports.
According to a report from the network, he appeared in a court on Saturday, saying he felt “decisively innocent when he was asked for a statement.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with a Class B offence, punishing himself with a one-day prison and a $2000 fine.
It's not the first time that Palin has to face a criminal announcement.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently before the Alaskan court for war veterans.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, violation of reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drugs in connection with the incident.
He allegedly hit his girlfriend's face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by war veterans in 2016 when she associated her son’s violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her son’s ministry in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on Sulawesi Island occurred on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks are out of operation and in the coming days, the number of victims is expected to rise.
The earthquake struck directly at the shot of a part of the island of Sulawesi, located north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
A video showing the moment of the disaster appeared on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Palu, when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand exceptional death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people have died, is an exceptional punishment that has not been granted for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly carried out an attack on the bike path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan using a rented truck Home Depot, which was put away by pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a number of injuries, thus defining the conditions of the intention to grant the death penalty according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, these numbers would both mean the possibility of granting a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including allegations of murder in favor of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and allegations of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and preparation,” claims the prosecutors, and describes how Saip’s act was carried out, as abominable, cruel, and perverse.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlii, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendosa and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York court last granted the death penalty.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
Last time the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with the federal case in New York in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, who were shown a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both of them sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal regret over the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he felt good about what he did.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching the videos of the Islamic State on the phone.
Police also reported that he also demanded the flag of the Islamic State to be suspended in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal public defenders, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutors’ decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and a life sentence without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma of these events to anyone concerned,” Patton said.
The Saip's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
According to Conservative Party Members, he should be charged with Brexit negotiations by NIGEL FARAGE
Nigel Farage, during today’s protest at the Conservative Party’s conference, committed to “mobilizing the army of the people.”
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must “feel pressure” from Euroskeptics, as one of Theresa May’s own MEPs suggested, he should lead negotiations with the EU.
In a march in Birmingham, conservative MP Peter Bone said that the UK would be out now if it were the secretary for Brexit, Mr Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in the reconciliation of her ranks, where there is a deep split, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting to remain in the EU who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his Chequers compromise plan going under attack by Brexit supporters, supporters of the Union and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that they continue to try to agree with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and its “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave group would gather in Solihull, where he wanted to “gain Chequers.”
He proposed to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he were in the lead, we would be out today,” he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: “I’ll stand up for Brexit, but we have to go to Chequers.”
To show his resistance to the EU, he said: “We have not fought world wars so that we have to listen.
We want to do our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to remain is totally up to date.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the march, told reporters: “I simply say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
\"Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and do not like him members of our party or our activists who are currently filling the streets to be elected at all.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp report to Mrs May, she says, \"Ministers will keep their place when they keep their promises.\"
Mr Farage stated that conservative politicians must “get into a difficult situation” if they wanted to betray their decision taken on the basis of a 2016 referendum.
\"Now it's about trust between us - people - and our political class,\" he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re standing here today to tell them, ‘We won’t let you.’”
He added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel pressure.
“We are now mobilizing the army of this country’s people, which has secured us a victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Great Britain that rules itself.”
In the meantime, supporters of the Union marched with Birmingham and then held two-hour meetings in the city centre.
Several activists have had banners of the Conservative against Brexit after the weekend’s start of the party’s operation.
Labour MP Lord Adonis laughed at conservatives because of the security issues of the party's application after the start of the conference.
“These are the people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
The whole thing is a farce.
“There is nothing like a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “think” the president’s candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would “rethink the candidacy for the president”
Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrats spoke about their future on Saturday at a city hall in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is trying to re-elect November against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters at the city hall from the moment Trump sat in office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to apply for the office of the president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means a woman in the highest place.
He was arrested suspect of shooting Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect from Friday's shooting of a basketball player from LSU's Wayd Sims team.
Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video from Friday's shooting was released with requests to identify a man captured on the recording.
Sims, 20, was shot on Friday in the morning near Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head injury that was not compatible with life,” police commander Murphy J. Paul told the media via 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to moving at the scene of the crime, had a gun and admitted the shooting of Wayde Sims.
The Simpsons, without any incidents, were held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Six feet and six inches tall, Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches, of which 10 were last season, and the average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 slots per match.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion when the team’s director played him in the hands of victory over Sebastian Vettel.
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished out on Saturday in front of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team director would play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the field and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two turns and urged Vettel to attack a teammate.
Vettel entered the depot first and let Hamilton catch up with the cars circling on the tail of the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes driver went to the depot a little later, and after leaving, he was ranked Vettel. However, Hamilton went forward and, in a tight duel, the Ferrari driver was reluctant to leave the inner track off so that he could defend himself in the third turn after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen left the rear row of the driving field and at the end of the first round he was in charge on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race because he held the original tires as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and could beat Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
In the end, he went to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and when he was ordered, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team did a fantastic job and the rewards are the first two places,” Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting because she insisted she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford on charges of a candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, for sexual assault.
During a speech at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention Ford’s testimony to the Senate’s judicial commission, instead saying that what’s going on in the Senate shows that people are “evil and detestable and lying.”
“One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that is happening in the last days in the Senate when you see that anger when you see those people getting angry and angry and disgusting and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the release and the publication and they say to you, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it -
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you take the leak?
Remember her answer... you published the document... oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish -
Well, wait a minute.
No, no, no, he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein sent Ford a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information leaked early in September - but Feinstein refused to escape her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, nor did I disclose information about the case,” said Klomisi Feinstein, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do.
However, her words apparently did not believe the president, who spoke about the case at the meeting on Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this is a serious bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway, it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court judge, who three women accused of sexual harassment, and suggested that the Democrats were using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power back by any means available.
You see the detestability, the abominable, they don’t care who to hurt, who to put into the ground, to get back to power and to the steering wheel,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars fixed Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants winning Saturday's showdown in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took a two-way lead thanks to the interventions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowie were able to match the house before Dwyer returned the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard then compared Dundee again, and the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen insured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for the Adam Keefe team, who managed to defeat 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
Both teams have met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous games being dominated by Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with Kendal McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford credited the second goal to Beauvillier four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt set a goal for Cowie, who compared at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabin at the first break only in the lead when he scored his second goal at the end of the first third.
The house was regrouped, and Bouchard was able to match again with a goal from the match game at 27:37.
Co-operation between Cowie and Charles Corcororan later helped Nielsen for the first time in the match to shift leadership to the Dundee side, and the same player insured his team’s management in the middle of the final third.
Giants, who have now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play another match on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic chief dies to allow hundreds of people on board aircraft to escape earthquakes
The head of flight in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died when he oversees a plane with hundreds of people on board safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a large earthquake on Sulawesi on Friday that caused the tsunami.
Strong subsequent shocks flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But even though colleagues of the 21-year-old Anthónius Gunawan Agunga fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in the wild with a throwing control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pala.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the ranch at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped from the control tower down when he thought he was moving.
He died at the hospital later.
Air Navigation spokesperson Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, told ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared the transport by helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimanta, which was transported to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
“Our hearts are broken by this message,” he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The disaster resolution agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutique cities was limited.
“The number of deaths continues to increase because many bodies remain unreleased under the wreckage, and many of them have still not been rescued,” Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugro said in a statement.
The waves in the ravaged Pala reached a height of up to six meters. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft bring assistance and delivery to the affected places.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies here.
There is a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are stolen everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find on the spot.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be even worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Pala on Sunday and told the country’s military forces: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
“You’re ready,” said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok this year, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims one man is missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed in a lagoon on one of the micron islands in the Pacific, now said one man was missing, saying at the beginning that all passengers and crew reading a total of 47 people were safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that she was unable to find a man on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a lost man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the requirements for details of this passenger, age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers remained in treatment on Saturday and they were all in stable condition.
However, what caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The U.S. Air Force and Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon before the landing.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane wanted the flight.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed from a very low altitude.
“That was very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that he and others managed to get water through the belt deep to the emergency exit of a sinking aircraft.
He also said that the crew were panicking and screaming and that he himself suffered a lighter injury on his head.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working near the port pier had helped rescue by means of an inflatable boat carrying passengers to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network reports that a total of 111 people have died in the past two decades in a PNG-registered plane crash, but no accident has occurred to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The charges ended on Saturday in a case in which a man is repeatedly tried to burn a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice has testified for several hours in its analyst Paul Rowlett and provided expert insights into intelligence analysis.
The jury analyst outlined a screenplay of how he used 29 cell phone records from Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was her death at Chambers on the night, which was contrary to his previous statement, the Clarion Ledger reported.
When the cell phone data showed that he spent the night with Chambers, he decided he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then the police visited.
Sanford stood before the court in the council and testified that the day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said, \"He's lying because my car was in Nashville that night.
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
However, the records from the cell phone indicate that the two knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said a moment after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He has completely erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to come before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What Is a Conscious Hip Hop?
Hip hop trio wants to deal with negative views on this genre by filling his music with positive messages.
Bristol’s High Breed band says hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
So they want to go back to their roots and re-popularize the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recovery in the past thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black girl?
NY educator sues couple for throwing out “racist text report”
A New Yorker is suing a couple for her discriminatory banishment after receiving a missent text message from her mother, in which she was described as “another black woman,” a text message.
The couple rejected that they were racists and compared the lawsuit with \"extortion.\"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her apprehension when she found out on the first day of her 2016 job that her child’s new educator, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
“NEEEÉÉÉÉÉ, another black woman,” wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she was twice sent by pi. Maurice.
When she understood her faux passport, “the alarmed one, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman, threw out Mrs. Maurice and said that she was just leaving the teacher who was an African-American, working really badly, and that she was expecting the Philippines instead,” the New York Post said.
Mrs. Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing a couple for being fired from work and asking for $350 in compensation for the six-month engagement for which she was hired at the beginning, even if without a contract.
“I want to show them that this is not done,” Post said this Friday, adding, “I know that this is discrimination.”
However, the two returned the strike with the fact that they were not racists, but that the termination of Mrs. Maurice’s employment was an appropriate measure because they feared that they could no longer believe her after that insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not racist.
We are not racists,” said her husband, Joel Plasco, Post.
“But would you entrust your child into the hands of someone you treated grossly, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on.
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “extortion” and said his wife was only taking care of a two-month-old child and was in a “very difficult situation”
“Would you drive like this?”
That’s not a good thing at all,” said the investment banker.
Although the trial still persists, the Social Media jury quickly condemned the couple for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington's bear stories feared readers wouldn't identify with a talking bear, showing the latest news
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, told the rapporteur: “It’s difficult to feel the situation of someone who reads it for the first time before the publication.
It's very fun to know now that we already know the tremendous success of the Paddington bear -
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children’s book about a small plush bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, she added on the 60th anniversary of the book, which became “the sweet-hot spot” after his death last year.
To Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of her family,” she added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was quite a quiet man, he was never boasting,” she said.
“But because Paddington was such a real character for him, it was like you had a child who had achieved something you could really be proud of.
I think he looked at Paddington's success with this look.
Although it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all successes to Paddington.
My daughter died and I had to tell her goodbye by phone
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
“He called me regularly to tell me that this is really bad and he doesn’t expect it to happen,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I had a phone call from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
That's how I did it.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart going slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was as if everything closed.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in me -
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is now anointing the loss of her daughter, joined the plane with other passengers, without showing what a difficult test she is going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I held my head down, my tears flowed all the time.
It was difficult to explain, but it was just during the flight when I felt a stunning understanding of Nado.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send postcards to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can look for support.
Tyler's son, Mrs. Davis, was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, took his life at the age of 18.
“I wouldn’t want any other parent to feel what I felt every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile was able to light up every room.
However, before his death he left work because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found the unmoving body of his sibling after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m constantly worried about how this will affect his life.
Mrs. Davis proposed postcards “to inform people that there are people who are willing to help them and can talk to them even if they are their friends.
Don't sit silent - you need to talk -
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Daisy's teenage friend, lost Mark, who was her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother's death.
“Nothing told me he felt down or depressed, nothing at all,” he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
The worst thing was on Christmas Eve, when the children opened gifts, they didn’t even look at them, nothing.
She said the death of her partner was a great trauma for them, but that she must gradually get through it: “This thing can make a complete hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight -

Bretta Kavanaugh's future depends on how the FBI begins its investigation
\"I thought we could get something he really asked for - investigation at the time of the restriction, with a limited scope - we could bring a little unity into it,\" Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would \"break down - because both sides in partisan will bury themselves in conquered positions.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The elections in the middle of the electoral term are only five weeks away from us, 6 November, and if Republicans do wrong as expected, it will lead to their substantial weakening in attempts to enforce the man they want to post at the Supreme Court of this country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbyed them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI compiles its report?
The Senate will vote on this and currently there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the draw and confirm at the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea for Kim \"decreased\"
The number of refugees from North to South Korea has fallen since the beginning of Kim Jong-Un’s government seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers say.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1127 refugees in the last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park further said that it is behind tighter border checks between North Korea and China and higher rates of traffickers at the border.
Pyongyang did not make any public statements about this.
A large majority of refugees from North today receive an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees and often repatriates them.
The relations between North and South, which are technically still in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on halted denuclearization negotiations.
This was the historical June meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the U.S. of not making any progress on the issue of sanctions.
“Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves,” Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brittany Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said she was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brittany Kavanaugh \"hysterical\" and said she was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court because of her temperament.
Pelosi made this note in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but if any woman had ever performed such a theatre, they would have called it ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said in a response to Kavanaugh’s statement Thursday before the Senate’s court committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both still in puberty.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and suffocating in negotiations about his family and his years in high school.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the committee and said their allegations against him were \"grotesque and coordinated attacks - organized liberals who could not pass through Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she was unable to work at the Supreme Court because she showed that she was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and in a way that he based himself on Clinton and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question of whether she would seek Kavanaugh’s appeal in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives.
\"I will tell you this - if Congress is not telling the truth, then it is not only eligible for work at the Supreme Court, but also in the court it is currently working on,\" Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi said she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential returns in court in the Act on Acceptable Care or Roe vs. Wade because she was considered a conservative judge.
As part of the hearings prior to his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided the answer to the question of whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“There’s no time for a hysterical, biased person to come to court and expect us to just say ‘Jey, that’s beautiful,’” Pelosi said.
Women must rule it.
After words, months, and years, she couldn’t get rid of it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual,
She continues: “A woman who was doing the director somewhere helped me, and who told me she was also crying when she was angry, but she created a certain technique. This means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, “You may think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm angry -
And so she continued.
And I think that's great.
Tears are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, partly because they are incomprehensible.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office where men dominated. I once expressed my inexpressible anger with crying. But the older, always cold manager, who I always feared a little, caught my neck and pulled me on the staircase.
“Never show them you’re crying,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
She thinks you're sad and they'll be glad they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, a once-democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an unmarried affair on board Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the battle. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me laughing after 30 years.
“There were seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it “Snow and seven Dwarfs”
Since the campaign has been running for a long time, it has not been able to keep up with receiving contributions, so it has committed not to play the match unless it receives $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give 1,000 dollars to a male candidate would only give her 250 dollars.
“She thinks I’m going to get a discount,” she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions - as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it harder for her to raise money and focus on the electorate rather than the delegates and anger over sexism, that she was completely stifled by anger.
“You might think I’ve made a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder said of how the press responded.
“And you might have thought that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write to me on a gravestone.

Why China-American Trade War Could Be Good for Beijing
The opening salva of the trade war between the US and China was deafening and although the battle is far from being fought, according to experts among the countries, in the long term, the crack between countries is advantageous for Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, provided the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Most of the most important escalations, however, saw the light of the world this week, when new tariffs on goods were announced for $200 billion ($150 billion), which practically means the taxation of half of trade exports from China to the US.
Beijing has always responded by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of American goods.
China has tried to pay the US with the same coins, and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economy would be stuck in its knees.
Even though China would like Washington to return to its original tracks, it would mean giving way to its demands, but the public subject to American demands would be absolutely degrading for China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact is that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic outburst in both countries, much more dangerous than the observers have admitted so far,” said Abigail Grace, a research co-worker who focuses on Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, U.N. Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country were improving.
“Today’s situation in the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists into a normal state.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now fulfilled, as well as one-sided economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million people since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries sponsored by the rebels.
Europe responds strongly to the win at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Evria team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the U.S. Team with a 16.5 final score of 10.5 to the Le Golf National at the edge of the difficulties in France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Mickelson, who was most concerned about the tour, then fired the ball into the water at 3 pairs of 16 holes and left the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molini then lit up in all of his rounds and became one of 4 players and achieved the best score of 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson's top-rated world player, he lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who probably graduated from his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the overall best European player with 25.5 points earned for his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It was a rough year.
So thanks Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy to get the cup back.
“It all depends on the team, I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said after winning Europe.
He gave the cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I feel the incredible pride of defeating Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching that guy,” the 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and has now recorded a career record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
The strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, which won 14 biggest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can compare.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who performed top golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said, “I’m proud of these guys, they really fought.
This morning, we really warmed up at heart.
We really couldn't handle it.
I'm putting my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee.
I like those 12 boys, I'm glad I could make them a captain.
I really have to slip.
You've lost us -
Red Influenza Updates: The concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota districts
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission highlights the overall decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, stains of flowering water are now reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - this indicates a decreasing concentration.
The flowering water of the red tide has a range of about 130 miles of coast from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
The stains were observed about 10 miles from the coast in Hillsborough County, but last week it was relatively less places.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
In the Hillsborough District, low to high concentrations were observed in the high seas, the lowest to high concentrations in the Manatee District, the lowest to high concentrations on the coast or on the high seas of the Sarasota County, the lowest to the middle concentrations in Charlotte County, the lowest to high concentrations on the coast or on the high seas near Lee County, and low concentrations in the Collier County.
Respiration irritations continue to occur in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory irritation was reported in northwestern Florida last week.
