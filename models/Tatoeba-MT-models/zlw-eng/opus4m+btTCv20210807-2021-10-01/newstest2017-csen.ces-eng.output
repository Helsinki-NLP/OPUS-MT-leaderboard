Eighty-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco store
An eight-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was the stairs of the local store this week.
But the victim’s brother says he doesn’t think of anyone who wants to hurt him, and adds: “He finally began to succeed.”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eight-year-old San Francisco Frank Galicia, the law firm said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia for ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who had previously been a ranked chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters said his death was “shocked and destroyed.”
“We have a small team that works as a family, we’ll miss it very much,” the spokesperson said.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in the hostels, but that recently \"he was finally starting to succeed -
“He found an apartment, he walked with a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't think of anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food, he made us dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any fights.
He was a brother who took things as they are.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unbroken diamond that lit up every day,” he said.

The Czech Railways have invested over 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
They also have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier has invested over 31 billion crowns in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, with about half of the trains having a new closed toilet system.
However, the amounts of modernization in each year, except for 2012, are gradually falling.
Czech Railways have invested over 31 billion crowns in vehicle modernization over the past six years.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, with about half of the trains having a new closed toilet system.
The money spent has been shown to reduce the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic cars.
A larger share of the investment was put by the carrier in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money was spent, and 40 percent of the company invested in the recovery of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years old.
However, modernized older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the vehicle upgrades were not counted, the average driving age of the ČD vehicles would increase by ten years.
A little older are on average passenger wagons whose average age is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of production were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years, both Czech and global railways have gradually disappeared and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, locomotives fell from 280 to 223 units, similarly the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier got rid of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars demolished.
From investments planned to take place in the vehicle park ČD in the near future, for example, it is possible to indicate the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic quick track.
The contract involves the collection of up to 30 motors and 20 electric units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can’t get rid of it.
We are totally powerless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editor of the online daily Aktuně.cz follows the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where there is not only a touristly interesting walk in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
The highway managers know they're standing there black, but they're saying they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds of such advertisements across the country, perhaps thousands.
According to officials, there is a gloomy law on blame, because of which it is not possible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
They need a complex bureaucracy wheel.
Meanwhile, the company will change its name and the office will be short on it.
Or just move the ad by a few meters and the official process must start again.
The Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main stroke from České Budejovice to Lipno stands on our plot near the state road advertising billboard black.
Not even three months were enough for officials to get rid of the illegal portable construction with a giant advertising poster.
It's as if no one cares that he's standing right next to the road, in a 50-metre protection zone where nothing can stand for safety.
Road managers say they can't deal with billboards because of the law.
Maybe load it and drive it away.
“We must not afford this,” said the spokesperson for the Directorate of Road and Highways Nina Ledvinová, referring to a complex bureaucratic wheel that must be prevented by law from removing the billboard.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began to follow the online daily Aktualne.cz in detail in the spring, is not unique and shows a general problem that cannot be solved effectively and quickly by the authorities.
In southern Bohemia alone, the editor counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against rules just next to or near the road.
There are other countries in the same way.
“We are having trouble forcing the company to remove the pilgrims,” says Jiří Klása, Head of the Transport Department of the Czechoslovak Regional Office, whose colleagues solve similar stories.
According to Klása, there is a glaring law that binds officials.
First of all, the owner of the billboard must appeal to him to put the ad away.
However, the company’s bosses are often unattainable or know the fin that Aktualne.cz has described in the past when it began to be more interested in the issue: it is enough to move the mobile stand with advertising by a few meters, and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising into the basket.
This is because the office needs to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
“If someone moves it and coordinates suddenly disagree, it looks like a new device and we have to reach the owner again,” explains Jiří Klása.
The new law will not help.
The change could have brought about a new law that would ban billboards at highways from September next year and limit them to Class I roads.
Critics point out that rules for combating illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities are not going to be relieved.
Companies can continue to make tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on leases of illegal areas and no one can afford them.
For example, a billboard appealing to Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Czech housing magistrate is currently running three administrative proceedings for black-built billboards.
The company is in danger of three hundred thousand fines in every proceedings.
These are multiple ads that were without permission placed in the protection zone of Class I road.
The management has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the Českádějovice Magistrate.
Advertising that Aktualny.cz is interested in is not yet configured among these cases, but will most likely be added to them.
According to ŘSD spokesman Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will reach the table of regional and then probably master officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't be contacted.
It does not take the mail and the official seat in Žižkov cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not clear who's behind her.
In the past, the company’s mail went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who was famous for the sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representative of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard leases and offers them to advertisers, has refused any connection in the past.
This spring, when ŘSD began to encourage Aktualne.cz interested in advertising on Lipno, Fischer let state officials send a letter for the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where allegedly the company is newly based.
No one has spoken to highway managers from this address yet.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Similar silences or opaque changes in settlements are not unusual.
A few years ago, we gradually fined one company for two million crowns.
But she changed her name and ID and there was nothing to do with it.
The case returned, the ads continued, perhaps in other places.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It is like fighting windmills, admitted under the condition of anonymity by one of the officials.
No one has yet addressed the amendment of the law.
He spoke with several members who were interested in the problem.
They have not yet developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for national, but also regional and municipal policies.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they themselves need them because of advertising in election campaigns.
I don’t think there’s a fairly established impression that if something doesn’t work, we need to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more beets and moats are estimated by statistics.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
However, this year’s harvest exceeds the average in the last five or ten years.
On the other hand, the beet harvest (by 3.9%) and the moat (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is due to an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a ten-day decline against last year.
Last year’s grain harvest was above average.
This year’s harvest exceeds the average over the past five and ten years.
On the contrary, this year’s harvest of beet and flour will be higher.
The beet growers will harvest 3.9% more than a year ago when they got under the roof of 1.256 million tons.
This year’s flour harvest could be 2.5% higher than last year’s.
The expected decrease in the production of cereals is due to both a decrease in the hectares yield by 3.7% to 5.71 tonnes per hectares and a decrease in the seed area.
This year, farmers were seeded by three percent less fields.
Winter wheat, which is the most important grain for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be 3.3 percent less harvested this year.
Farmers put it in more fields.
However, the decline will sign a lower hectares yield, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
Approximately a fifth decrease in statistics is assumed in barley spring, which is most often used for beer production.
The reduction in crop yield costs 15.2 per cent, but also a lower yield per hectares.
Winter barley is 6.3% more born.
The harvest also grows alive.
The crop of beet statistics is estimated at 1.305 million tonnes, which is more against last year.
The living areas have expanded by 7.3%.
However, hectar yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s beet harvest will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, and it will be planted on an area of one-third more extensive than ten years ago.
In the last four years, there have also been fields with mace.
Farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares this year.
Against 2008, when the mac was grown in the Czech Republic on a record 70,000 hectares, however, the field is half.
Thanks to the expansion of seed areas, this year’s harvest will make the moat richer.
It will rise 2.5% to 27,423 tonnes last year.
However, hectar yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police officers accused two men of attacking with a knife and a machete, the court sent them into custody.
Police accused two attackers who attacked a knife and a fifty-five-year-old man in the center of Olomouc on Tuesday.
“Although the assaulted man tried to escape, he was caused by rectal and cutting injuries that required treatment in the hospital and other treatments,” police spokesman Marie Štrbáková said.
Both of them were arrested by police immediately after the attack.
The defendant filed a lawsuit for them to be taken into custody and the court met him on Friday.
Both men are at risk of three to ten years in prison.
Police have accused two arrested of assaulting a 35-year-old man in the center of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him a serial and cutting injury, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which occurred on Tuesday at right noon in the Freedom class, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, the Olomouc police spokesman Marie Štrbáková said.
A massive clash between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive vocabulary, two attackers attacked with the help of a knife and a machete of a fifty-year-old man.
Although the assaulted man tried to escape, he was caused by congestive and cutting injuries that required treatment in the hospital and other treatments, a police spokesman said.
During the battle, which attracted great attention in the city centre, and for which several police guards and guards had to intervene on the spot, it was a family dispute.
Criminals of a 40-year-old man from Slovakia and a 70-year-old man from Olomouc have been accused of trying to cause serious harm to health and teardown.
The defendant filed a motion for a court to take them into custody and the court met him on Friday, the spokesman added.
In the centre of Olomouc, the attackers also used Machet five years ago, it happened only a few dozen meters further, before the Varna disco in Riegrove Street.
Police said a group of about ten foreigners attacked the guests of the company who were standing in front of the entrance.
Police said they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two attackers with a conditional punishment.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You’ll be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most exhilarating examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former seat of the IPB in the middle of the Senovažné square.
It was supposed to work as a hotel for a long time.
But still nothing.
Is it necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about the use of existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square there are several apartment houses, which despite its location, size and often also monumental protection only emptiness and emptiness.
We selected properties in the center using the project Prazdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the territory of the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or belonging to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
Empty houses are more than homeless in the Czech Republic.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, they want an initiative
Almost shot by Fidel Castro, Hitler's brother lived there.

Shopping apocalypse.
Shopping centers in the United States are empty.

Clinton's husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were paid to Clinton for charity.
Most of Clinton's revenue -- over $6 million -- is for their manifestations.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
U.S. Democratic Candidate Hillary Clinton published her tax returns on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
Most of Clinton's revenue -- over $6 million -- is for their speech, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s spouses paid a federal income tax of 34.2% last year and then a tax on income at state and local level of 9%.
In total, they paid 43.2% of income on taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar move, so far he has not decided to make a tax return public.
There is a certain possibility that Donald Trump does not pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after her confession was published.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrets surrounding Trump’s revenue, among other things, to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims to be, the AP said.
Trump's wealth is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would harm the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Caine, who is running for vice president in tandem with a former first lady, has published a report on his tax revenues over the past ten years.
Together with their wife Anne Holton, they paid 7.5 percent of their income on charity and taxed 25.6% of their earnings last year.
In Nigeria, polio broke out again.
The Boko Haram Islamists defended consistent vaccinations and killed doctors.
There were cases of polio in Nigeria.
In the north-east of the country, the government declared extraordinary vaccinations, as two children infected with this disease were protected.
Vaccines were brought there by helicopters.
In the affected area, there were Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram who defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was unnoticed.
In northeastern Nigeria, an extraordinary polio vaccine will begin, as two children infected with the disease have been protected there.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed in Somalia two years ago.
Nigeria’s government has announced that a million children and four million more in neighbouring states will be vaccinated in Borno.
Nigeria’s military helicopters on Friday quickly transported child polio vaccines to the northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been unnoticed for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram have prevented vaccines in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also prevented doctors from entering areas where polio children were detected.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO department responsible for eradicating polio Michel Zaffran’s BBC station said that vaccination in Nigeria would begin next week.
In Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram was active for a long time.
The area was made available to international organizations and governments only earlier this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken this part of the country in a crucial way.
Nigeria’s health minister Isaac Adewole admitted that the new cases of polio were a great disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio was exterminated.
The WHO warned that it was possible that although the disease did not appear for two years, it spread among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all cases of polio in the world.
While polio was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now only persists in three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met twenty former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of shepherds thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look with confidence into the future.
Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope Francis met twenty former prostitutes in Rome who were liberated from the power of a gang of shepherds.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the stories of the fallen women for more than an hour and then urged them to look with confidence into the future, the Vatican spokesperson said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
They were all subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
By visiting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for the strengthening of the fight against it, the pope’s spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fates of people on the outskirts of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will hit jihadist factories.
Without the help of Muslims, this will not happen.
In the fight against radical Islamism, France has been helped by Muslims themselves.
In addition, Prime Minister Manuel Valls’ government is making major changes to the functioning of mosques and spiritual education.
We have closed 20 mosques and prayers since last December.
And others will follow, the Interior Minister said.
There are over a hundred jihadists in the country.
“If Muslims do not help the state to fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly harder for France to guarantee this religion,” said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who have been educated in France preach in mosques and prayer rooms.
At the same time, he wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, most of Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This is why preachers who can sow radicalism in France get into the mosque.
“Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy,” he added.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Islamic Foundation was founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
At that time, the Foundation had contributed to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institutions soon hit internal contradictions and rivalry.
“It’s a total failure,” Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, there was a debate about a new institution replacing the non-functional foundation.
All of them succeeded in further terrorist attacks in France, carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has recently been told that the new foundation will be set up in October.
He will have two main tasks - to secure the financing of mosques from home sources and also to oversee imams.
For now, it is not clear where it will take money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or a tax on halal food.
Here, in practice, halal food sellers would pay for providing certification.
Some of this money would then go to the foundation.
A contribution of ten to twenty euros ($270 to 540) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year there are about 30,000 trips to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have undergone special education programs at French universities should be present in mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We will close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is in a campaign against radicals.
And others will follow, the Interior Minister recently announced.
In France, there is no place for those who in mosques proclaim hatred and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
According to estimates, there are about 2500 mosques and prayers in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled about 80 imams and are considering it for several more decades.
But not everyone thinks that government action can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint with the star Bauge.
The Czech cyclist must fight for the procedure to the eight-finals in repair rides.
Track cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics after the sprint qualifying procedure among the best eighteen lost in the first round to the French Grand Prix Grégora Bauge, a silver defender from past games in London.
The process to the eight-final must be fought in repair proceedings.
27 riders stood at the start of the royal discipline on the track, and the best Czech racer currently credited the fourteenth best time.
Two-hundred with a fly start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main withdrawal phase, he was thus expected to qualify for the fifth Baugé, which already has a bronze in the team sprint from Rio Bronz.
At the end of the day, Kelemen reached out to an experienced Frenchman, but he looked at the procedure.
The gold defender Jason Kenny was a great performer.
The eight-year-old Brit scored the third fastest two-hundredths of history and won the qualification at the Olympic record of 9.551.
It was also easy to deal with the last progress that was made by the German Maximian Levy.
The British quartet was also successful with Bradley Wiggins, who took a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4 km fighter race and went to the final.
The current maximum (3:51,659), which was four years since the London Olympics, has improved by more than a second.
Young doctors are pushing: they want fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute for a new contract.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the entire board to support further field events in early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to resolve the contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted to reject the agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted Thursday night on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government remained “silence to questions,” which was a great deal to reject the contract.
She said: “In this light, the Executive Authority of the JDC decided to completely reject the proposed new treaty and to demand new formal negotiations on all issues,” she said.
In response to the government’s silence today, the JDC Executive Board formally asked for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve the running programme of horrified industry events from the beginning of September.
The dispute led a young doctor this year to announce six bets, including the first general bets in the history of the NHS.
The leader of young doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract that BMA recommended.
BMA members at meetings before the vote before 54,000 young doctors and medical students said the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said the treaty would be a burden for medical professionals in England.
Russia and Turkey: The Union of ‘Incompatibility’
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hand over their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long-term verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimír Putin welcomed a Turkish counterparty in the lavish hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
It came to hand, yes.
But Putin did not smile and hardly radiated his warmth, even according to his measured standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly talked about his “Dear friend”, Mr Putin, five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its level before the crisis, but that they would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting down of a Russian combat aircraft by Turkey at the Syrian border.
Moscow’s response was fierce.
Putin sold wounds around him, and Ankara accused Moscow of hitting the knife in the back.
The aggravation was much greater that it had come from a supposed friend.
Building true trust again will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media led a massive campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly it looked like the Turks could do anything.
More serious was the allegations from top state officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting occurred only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared a victory.
The benefits of the ceasefire are clear for Ankara.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost deprived of power during the failed coup last month and therefore needed all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shocked him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions had a severe impact - especially the abolition of charter flights, which will transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey every year.
This figure was reduced by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will really breathe here when flights are restored.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey would be allowed again.
“Tourists back there, tomatoes back here, as reported in the newspaper of Science.
However, the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it considers to be a poor reaction to a coup attempt.
In addition, the long-standing hostility of lengthy talks about the EU's accession and Putin's accession - which is eager to use and tear Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after trying to coup.
You must understand that for Moscow, which is deeply rooted in the fear of regime change, it is given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to demonstrate what one of the analysts described me as “the alliance of the incompatibles”: how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West unite.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey stand on the opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of opening talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
Turkey’s president deliberately avoided answering questions about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both countries could find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and due to the risk of complete disaster when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft - it is certainly better that both leaders speak again at least.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be suppressed into the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
She almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, the strategist brands used “RBS” to protect other consumer finance brands.
It cost millions of pounds to sponsor international sports, from the Six Nations rugby championship to Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more stand out rather to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not run new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of central and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking that will get more to the forefront - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our journeys to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan’s questions.
The BBC’s Scotland station said: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand our employees are working for, because now we are becoming a brand bank much more.
Because the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts to focus on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championship, it has prepared a profile of individual brands of sports sponsorship.
“It’s a good time for us to move to a brand bank because the basic question (which we’re asking) is how we focus on becoming a better customer bank,” he said.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had said that we would become a great bank for customers and introduced those brands.
But along with how we focused on customer needs, and not our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can remind these brands again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horseback Predilction led to the 3000st winner's goal
Dettori sprays champagne after he won a double win in Newmarket with 3,000 wins
Frankie Dettori won the 3000th UK victory in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone reached his second victory in the evening on his local track - the horse Prediltion, trained by John Gosden.
Ital is the sixth feat to achieve such a result in plane racing.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Chester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
A three-time gypsy champion, Dettori, who had previously won the Ghayyar horse, said: \"It's strange -
I am very impressed because there is also my family.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket because I just settled here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not the Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I've been relieved and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilution after victory
Two jockeys of this milestone achieved in obstacle races - the champion of the zeo Richard Johnson and the 20-time pension champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who during his career broke records to the goal of more than 4,300 winners.
Chester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and is not a surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from the other riders in the weightlift.
He is a fantastic racing ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he had not only been on weekends and big races, he would have had 6,000 winners!
However, the truth is that Frankie was driving a winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
It is of a lively nature, which is good for British racing sports, but more importantly, it is an incredible feat.
Frankie Dettori celebrates his success with his famous summer jump
From the summer finishes to the summer ski jumps, Frankie Dettori was the messenger of the British plane race for two decades.
It was like a mountain ride.
A large number of winners of the big races, including his well-known \"great seven\" in Ascot, but he also survived the plane crash and was banned from starting because of drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a six-month start ban, but showed incredible inner strength and in spite of all doubters he returned in his best form.
And maybe it won’t be the last time, Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin Releases President Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest colleagues for many years.
Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “released Ivanov from his services the head of the Russian presidential office,” but there was no reason.
His place will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who was Ivanov's representative since 2012.
The 40-year-old Vajno was a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian) it is reported that later he was the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
In his appointment to Putin, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities of the head of state within the meaning of the draft laws and to control the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin said on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to release from his post and recommended that he replace it with Vajno.
Do they convince smiles?
This step was completely mystified by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin’s closest co-workers for a long time, as well as Putin worked for the KGB.
As the head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which aired state television, the two men said he was leaving the post of head of the presidential office at his own request.
But only a few people convinced the smiles in the cameras - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man once thought of as a possible president is at once eager to lead the environmental policy of Russia has met with great distrust.
On the Kremlin’s website, notes are quoted to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to give me this very difficult post, even a problematic post, to entrust to me for four years.
As it seems, I was the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivan one of his five closest collaborators.
He even speculated that Ivanov might be the successor of Putin after his second term, because the third period would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken by another close Putin co-worker, Dmitry Medvedev.
Before returning to the presidential office, Putin became prime minister only three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson, star of the Ideas of the Criminals, was released after he hit the director
Gibson got involved in the physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The television stations ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced their release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday.
There were creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry that this happened,\" he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS, details on how Gibson's character disappears from the series that follows the FBI agents' stories a little later.
The 40-year-old actor, known for her lead roles in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, starred in the series since the first series in 2005.
“I love the criminal’s thoughts and have given my heart and soul to them over the past 12 years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I was hoping I'd be in it until the end, but that's not going to be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could have hoped for.
The return of the series to the 12th series is expected on September 28th.
In Banff mysteriously landed in the garden of fish
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sand eel, which left water shrink there.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a short film of his finding on the Periscope channel in the belief that someone could help him to clarify how about 5 centimetres of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - so the bridge is now connecting with Fife.
This is the first of the four closures between the “Floors of the Platforms”, which are now almost complete around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is the historic moment and symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnessing how building engineers have effectively used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the platform of the bridge was a delicate operation that required exceptional accuracy.
In its place is now more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, the concrete for the last part of the platform is now cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to pick up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge constructors project, said: “The first closure when building each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the tip of ground construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the expanding North Tower platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern proximity viaduct 700 millimetres southward.
This was a massive and delicate operation at the same time.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and it was necessary to pull it with a rise of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimetres in every direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happi that they are alive”
Three men are “lucky to be alive” after they were washed out of their fishing boat at Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station declared an alarm on Friday at 13:20 a.m. British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to sail safely, while their boat continued indiscriminately.
“We’ve seen their boat circle in their vicinity and we’ve had the worst of it,” said Moelfre Vince Jones.
“Fortunately, the strong wind took him away from them before we left,” he added.
Two men rescued a local fishing boat, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a life-jacket exhausted as he holds the fight.
All of them were on board a coastal lifeboat and we'll take them back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely without injury.
The boat's engine had a rope for an emergency shutdown, but somehow there was his disconnection from the person driving the boat when it was overturned.
Someone was holding a protective hand from above the boys.
The judge refuses to resolve the case because of his wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs who, according to the charges, should have received a political post for political concessions from Prime Minister Necas and his then head of the cabinet, Jana Nagy.
In 2012 it was the approval of the tax package.
Šnajdr, Fuksa, and Hluchor allowed him by their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state companies.
And so they also faced suspicions of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, they were unlawfully compensated for almost 2 million crowns.
He now acts as a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building on the Fruit Market and solves civil disputes.
However, the judge Helena Králá wants to be cautious (resolution of criminal law matters) and avoid possible objections.
The case seems to be taken care of by another court in Prague.
The King has already two times abhorred the guilt of Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagy.
It was an alleged abuse of military intelligence to track Prime Minister Nectime Radka’s first wife.
In this case, he did not configure the interpreter.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary reaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in this way to exclude a court if witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid nothing could be judged, he noted for the diary.
“It seems to me dead,” he added.
In the case of political accidents, Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged.
According to his lawyer Peter Toman, however, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the District Court of Prague 1 discussed the prosecution of former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Peter Nectime Jana Nagy (now Necasová) and other accused in the case of the abuse of the Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Netime and her husband come to court.
She was supposed to deal with Peroutka's statements.
His wife, for example, was to judge the statements of President Milos Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said he had sympathy with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schools is already dead!
The girl appears to have been killed in an Allied airstrike.
She flew to Syria with her two equally old friends last February from Gatwick Airport in London.
The British Interior Ministry did not comment on her death.
The young Londoners who fled home were secretly transported to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, and Kadiza Sultana, have been headed by the media for their former classmate from Bethnal Green Academy in London.
The case last year sparked a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria so far, of which about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
The work of dreams for a hundred thousand pay.
A well-paid job that you don’t even need a college.
This is what it looks like at the first glance of work.
And often for the other.
The advantage is not only on Czech conditions extremely high salary (you will earn up to 180,000 CZK in work in IT in Prague), but also on extreme advantages.
This is due to a huge lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
The most sought after are according to statistics of personnel agency Grafton programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Thus, candidates do not compete for jobs, but job positions about candidates, comments Jitka Součková, Marketing Manager Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity for students.
Higher education means a good foundation and is a general indicator of the candidate’s intelligence and education, but it often does not have much in common with the knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which will not be replaced by a college once, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most profitable is in Prague.
Wages and wages everywhere move high above the Republican average.
The most money will come to Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hitparade.
“The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those of Prague,” Kubačka confirmed.
Technical Directors will earn the highest earnings.
In Prague and Brno, they can come to 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it does not fall there under 80,000 CZK.
IT project managers are also asked.
On arrival, they can earn 60,000 - 100 000 CZK.
It is also about graduates.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, this is not the case for even the students.
If companies drag and repay an expert from another company, they will be happy to reach out to the graduate.
They can raise it according to their own.
Without language, they will not.
The knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in every profession, but at least a decent English is necessary in the case of others.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we are faced with a number of cases where companies are looking especially for an educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker controls more foreign languages, he is interesting to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, Kubačka said.
Yoo at Google, there's paradise.
Czech workers at Google can be quietly envious.
Of course there is a flexible working time for them, the possibility of working from home or various shorter periods, not only for moms.
“The company provides four weeks’ leave after the birth of a child,” says Martina Joneková, Google’s spokesperson.
Health care for employees and family, food, transport, training, wellness or massages directly in the workplace.
Anyone who wants to learn is green and doesn’t care what the new one wants to learn.
This does not end the benefits.
Such a full fridge for free is definitely not to be thrown away.
A healthy lunch (in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microkitchens in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the spokesperson reveals.
And so that nothing has to be fired, so what it does not eat, it puts in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these on the Czech ratio of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“It’s not important for Google to have employees sitting in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifting or developing, ideas and innovative solutions,” the spokesperson said.
The United Nations has strongly criticized Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government - raises serious concerns about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law - warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in a statement.
He pointed out that “it is particularly disturbing to witness how important and influential public figures express public support for criminal armed struggles, which have been conducted by the marches on refugees at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey.”
“One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who go to Bulgaria in an irregular way are automatically arrested,” Zeid said.
And worse yet - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalised despite the fact that everyone has the right, under international law, to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has arrested 14,000 migrants this year, with 21,000 in the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to see the world change.
Many people have lamented over the past decade that teenagers and children are no longer playing outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of the screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people from the sofas and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally shrugged on TV, later on video games and the latest on smartphones.
It is great to see that technology and activities outside do not exclude each other.
Of course, I am talking about the fashion Pokémon Go, a character-based app that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decrease in interest in New Zealand and Australia before the introduction of this new game at the beginning of July.
Posting in other countries was then delayed due to the enormous interest that led to overburdening of servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out looking for Pokémon that they watch using GPS, and when they find them, they can “take pictures” (via a screenshot on the phone) or “catch” them.
Mania captivated the generation that played the game at a younger age, picked it up from the seats and the woman out looking for Pokémon.
In the U.S., there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that “the average person will do every day.”
Cardiogram apps for Apple Smart Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of starting the game, the number of watched people who practiced every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company does not have information about who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees rough data about the levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns to “find 30” from the couch and “be active every day” have fallen on barren soil because most public health messages are boring and designed for people who don’t look good.
However, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can’t give here.
But the beauty of the game Pokémon Go lies in the fact that people go out and do something that they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sun rays. And fun.
Some people even get new friends in pursuit of Pokémon.
As it happens, there are, of course, those boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can come in the door.
And what, like?
It's a breakthrough.
In their time, apps for smartphones, such as Fitbit, were able to track our activity, but they gave us no reason to do something like this game.
The news looks and the interest in it begins to fall at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help many people in pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic for a jump.
No effort at the hammer.
They all left behind in the simplest.
Excellent in everything.
Finally, the Olympic Championship.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight on Thursday for the title in a multi-battle, and the others crossed the full line under the Olympic spotlights.
The total score of 62,198 was clearly confirmed by her lead in front of the silver medalist and team member of the \"final five\" - Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafinová.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a performance at the hammer in the final of a multi-battle of individuals in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a series that won the multi-battle, and the fifth overall when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final rating was on the board and her long journey to this point ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her into the same league of unique athletes of their time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 medals at the World Championships - including 10 golds. Her breathtaking ensembles are a mix of ambition and precision, and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her \"the best gymnast she's ever seen\"
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between her and the burden of too much expectations.
Anything other than returning home to her family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman embraces after winning the gold and silver medal in the women's multi-battle final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was a exclamationist in the celebration of the leaving national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that during her long journey to the top she never looked forward, but that is not so true.
Part of her line-up in the plains - the one that contains a typical triple salto with a double turn - is set in Latin music, which would just fit home, into the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by her mother, Coach Aimee Boorman, on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The contest has not lost since the summer of 2013 - this is a series of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took a short lead with two turns, it was just an illusion.
The cast and the simple - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back to the forehead with 15,433 points per hammer - and finished with 15,933 points in plain.
Raisman hugged her gently when they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the shimmering red, white and blue shadows, Biles appeared tears when she fulfilled the wishes she once wrote in her diary.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third place with Mustafin, but then she had bronze due to the sum of the three best bands.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team, who the Americans call “the grandmother”, was quite ahead.
After her simplests, she sent a crowd of air kisses, mastered by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where he became a complete hit, a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in the car
According to a police report published Thursday, two women and a girl at the age of 12 died during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and her daughter Ellis Maleah were shot in a car parked on the driveway on June 12.
The report states that the armed man was on the side of the passenger and fired eight wounds from the handgun, and then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, it is not worth three times the murder of a robbery because the attacker did not take a wallet or the amount of $2,900 that one adult victim had with him.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic quarters, a total of nine attacks occurred in four months, killing seven people and two others injured.
“This is happening in the residential area in front of the house,” Howard said earlier this month for the branch of the KPHO station CBS.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including the brown Nissan of the late 1990s, the black BMW of the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital, where she later died.
Liner (31) and the daughter of Ellis Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, the target of which was an empty delivery just half an hour before the murder.
The investigators found the bullets and built a bullet from the rest of the bullets in the seat and from under the hood of the engine.
The mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike her peers, she suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I wouldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - clearly, you are ready for it,\" she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never know them and that he might not survive.
Some doctors even suggested that it be placed in the institute.
“My first reaction was that I thought people were not doing this anymore,” Picciut said.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Up to the age of three, he couldn't sit or crawl, and he still doesn't talk.
However, some milestones are slowly being filled.
He goes with help and rides a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth shows a sign speech by which Edmund says, “Please sing to me.”
“We teach him sign language,” Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says Edmund invented some characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different states: genetic, as is the case with Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary substantially.
It’s too early to tell us what impact Zika will have on the lives of infected people.
Picciut reminds her of the emotional tax that an uncertain future takes.
I constantly ask, “What will happen next?”
What's next?
And he's still not sure about that.
In fact, I never asked what the overall forecast was, because I don’t expect anyone to tell me at all.
Picciut has, however, an encouraging message for mothers of all children suffering from birth defects caused by Zika.
The situation is improving.
Know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rains and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and extensive floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare emergency on Friday. More rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) reported that after extreme spilling, a number of rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the southern Mississippi will pour out of their shores and threaten extensive flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said civil servants are constantly in contact with local authorities and the aid is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesperson for the National Security Governor’s office and preparedness for crisis situations, said they were receiving requests for vehicles for water, boats and sand bags.
Steele said that only a district of Tangipahoa asked for ten thousand bags with sand.
The flood patrols will remain in most southern Louisiana to work on Saturday.
The weather service said it could rain more than 8 to 13 centimeters above sea level.
In South Alabama, the flood patrol was on alert on Friday, when the rain continued in the area of Mobile.
The Comite River at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are expected to culminate this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both said they could flood a number of houses in the suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that the dangers are floods after the current in Ascension, when these distributed flows will only be cast slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, a little further south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest recorded levels on Friday at 9am.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson County in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among the rescuers at Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, has risen rapidly overnight.
He said he was warned by another stepson who lives nearby.
“We woke up and the water was approaching,” Hansford said.
We had her in our passport.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family members are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the crisis workers saved all three massive military-style trucks and moved them to the Gloster fire station, where they remained hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of heavy rains, the floods “swiftly spread” and the authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that between midnight and Friday morning, 35 centimeters of rainfall fell.
Krautmann said that the soil has been very crowded since Wednesday.
The authorities said the heavy rain and paid roads required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa district and cancellation of teaching in five school districts.
The branch of the WWL station CBS reported that 200 homes were flooded according to an old man from Tangipaho.
The people were evacuated into two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller said the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals trapped by high water.
In the village of Amite and in the city of Hammer, shelters were established for those who were evacuated.
“They’ll be able to go home when the water starts to turn around,” he said.
More than 20 streets were closed in the Tangipahoa area in the city of Hammer, and locals were given sand bags that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
“We had the last major floods here in March,” said Lacy Landrum.
These floods seem to be similar.
Mr Lacy, a crisis manager at Harrison County, Mississippi, said the Gulf Coast continues to rain.
He said a couple of homes were announced on Thursday, but none of them showed up on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amit, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in several places where I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and it’s still there.”
Mahaj Brown (6) - \"a boy shot down as they were solved - survived shooting in Philadelphia
Police said six-year-olds were shot in Philadelphia, and this week it was a second shot at a child at the age of six in the city.
The child’s grandparents identified him as Mahay Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say that the boy suffered several fire injuries, including weaknesses, legs, arms, and abdomen, but he was aware of transporting to the hospital.
“He caught a lot of power, his little body was shot down like a solution,” his grandmother’s station, Delores Melendez, said.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several operations.
A family told the station that the boy should be healed.
He was supposed to enter the first grade of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, there are two more victims in stable condition.
According to the station report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be a shooter.
According to CBS Philadelphia, there was probably a shooting between several armed men.
Guns of the attack type belonging to various assault weapons were found on site.
Apparently, it was definitely a continuing battle.
There were bullets on the street on both sides of the trail.
There seem to have been several armed combatants who were actively involved,\" said Anthony Ginaldi, captain of the Philadelphia Police station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also involved.
No one was arrested, and the police reportedly investigate video recordings from cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm with a bleak shot on Tuesday in front of a house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Larie
This is how I imagine the women’s gymnast team for this year’s Olympics, for several reasons.
First, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren \"Laurie - Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
Finally, we have a team that looks like America.
He also strengthened the presence of black and Latin American at the top of this sport.
The number one gymnast in the past four years has been African-American.
Simone and Gabby were at first and second place last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals was surprisingly a champion of the Olympics and America was cheering.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of the three-time world winner Simone Biles, Douglas and Laura Hernandez, who demonstrated unexpected but mastery gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the female multi-battle of individuals.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're witnessing a sports peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country it doesn't look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Larie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the \"final five\" - because the gymnast team at the next Olympics will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
However, the fact is that gymnastics is a financially challenging sport and gymnastics train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which keep parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, dressings, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their trustees and families). And this is far from everything.
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in suburban areas that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the trainings, and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, the coach of Larie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics trainings that are more accessible and accessible to communities of countless young girls who have inspired Simone, Gabby and Larie.
I founded a gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or low cost in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (especially black and Hispanic origins) and we have trained both national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means life benefits for good health, school successes and work.
It is the inspiration this team will send us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Larie, Gabby and Madison, for showing \"the girl's strength\" and you won the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to make their way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter another strike.
The ministers hoped that after concluding a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be an end to disagreements regarding the changes. But 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the election rejected the agreement.
Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract in July with NHS being in \"nobody's country\" and further delays would have a harmful impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work procedures in order to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Young Doctors’ Commission, said last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis will increase and therefore fair treatment with all doctors.
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors enters into a new contract, it is necessary to make progress and time goes by.
BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation have been met with the unwillingness to involve Dr. and often with deafening silence by the government.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, this option is still open.
“Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push to force and solve the concerns of young doctors.
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were delayed, as nurses and specialists were called to represent physicians who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be disagreements regarding the changes.
BMA wants higher pay for work on the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, called on young doctors not to enter any bets.
Mortimer said: “The industry action will achieve little or nothing at all, but there will be pressure on already overloaded teams and services, and concerns, exhaustion and disruptions for patients, nursing staff and their families will rise.”
Over the past two months, we have been dealing with the advice of young doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and whistleblower.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as stress, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study freedom and gender pay gap - was proof of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
The drug for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs around 60 crowns (two pounds). The authorities recommend giving it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The anti-diarrhoea drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a seizure in people with heart disease.
The drug is now administered for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart attacks every year, and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.
Infection and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which on the walls of the arteries creates a continuous layer.
If this layer is cut off, blood clots can occur, block access to the heart, and a heart attack.
If the clot is released, the bloodstream can continue, block blood supply to the brain and cause stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca, which is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of the formation of clots less likely.
The draft NICE Directive, which was published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg of aspirin, twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: \"Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences -
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
It has been shown that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the danger of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased to see that, with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options that are available to many thousands of people who will benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially about the risk of bleeding - is limited beyond three years, the design of treatment beyond this period is not recommended.
With computer culture, fraud began to flourish in Muslim areas.
The Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year due to corruption, which was associated with a government report
The culture of political correctness has led to an overlookation of the spreading frauds in Muslim communities, according to a government report today.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticizes police, election inspectors, and city halls for ignoring the abuse of voters because of “hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The earlier secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said the intimidation of voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that police should make cordons and warned voters to protect themselves from the electoral rooms.
He recommended that voters take a proof of identity with them and prove who they were at the election.
At present, voters need to give their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to apply indelible ink to the fingers of people when giving their voice to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It requests that the press be given greater access to documents from the meeting and to decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
“This is not only about protecting against election fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of an election scandal in Tower Hamlets, West London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled, the presiding mayor of the city of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post after allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had “cynically affected” the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his criticisms by accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, according to his words, \"led his campaign so that it would be a religious duty of dedicated Muslims to vote for it -
Up to 300 votes have been questioned or as a result of identity theft, when a person is voting and issuing himself from someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about fraud in the correspondence vote - which is claimed to have pressured older members of the Muslim community during it to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean the electoral system, including presenting a document of identity
The report states: “There has been evidence that the vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“There were concerns that... state institutions were holding their eyes before such behavior because of ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations on how to clean the system, including preventing political activists from manipulating correspondence voices and preventing “voting”
The report, which Theresa May is now evaluating, also asks for more detailed controls on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to present a proof of identity before the vote.
The use of indelible ink on the fingers of people in voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to a period of three years.
Ban political agitators and activists from manipulating the submitted correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordons around the electoral rooms.
Change laws to make it easier to prosecute people who are developing illegal pressure under the 1983 reform law.
Disable taking photos in the electoral rooms.
Require only English (except Wales) to work in the electoral rooms.
To strengthen training and ensure that workers adhere to the rule that voters go to the electoral cabinet individually.
Sir Eric criticizes London’s police and says it’s “surprising” that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal charges have been filed.
“The Court of Elections ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubts - in the power of proof of the crime.
It also criticizes the resultless \"check-out boxes\" in the Departments for the Registration of Voters at the Town Hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court ruling in the Tower Hamlets case by awakening.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Crazy cycling duke Kate and other dukes of famous personalities at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics went crazy this week with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevota, who is clearly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a twenty-four-year-old Olympic isn’t by far the only athlete seeking gold this year, who can boast of his own duo from the ranks of famous personalities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous personalities that are currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL Women's Column has compiled a list of Olympics who are more than far from similar to Hollywood celebrities.
A member of the American team of archerics, Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonard DiCapri.
In addition to Kate's pair on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be a twin star Leonard DiCaprio.
The racer from the American archer team, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures emerged, on which he clearly resembled a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he had heard of his similarity with Leo from a little boy.
“There’s no such thing as a beard, except for the beard,” Brady told Huffington Post.
\"He's a guy and he looks good, so I think he's a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted this year even more: the striking form between the British remote jumper Greg Rutherford and the favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafin, with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the series Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for change: The user thinks Nathan is “a athletic version” of the film Beginning (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar dense eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov is proud not only of the same eaten skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian of the US team fans say that she looks like \"the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt\"
Reading Women: Hope Sol's Football Star (on the left) and the Actress Jennifer Carpenter (on the right) have a similar face and eye shape
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed similarities
On the waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of pairs
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction over the fact that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are in fact identical.”
Hope Sol's football star and the actress of the television series Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a truly incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of actress Laura Linney, or a gold medal holder for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her wonderfully wide smile, which as if he were copying the smile of Gabrielle Union, the stars of Bravo, Girls!
The CBC’s Olympics commentator apologizes for saying that he “explored.”
The viewers of the Wednesday live stream from the Olympics at the CBC station outraged the performance analysis of the fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan by the commentator Byron MacDonald.
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer during the race “pulled like a smell” and “pulled out”
By the end of the final, Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone had been turned off when he began to gnaw his own opinions at the 4x200-meter-free finale.
He said: “The little 14-year-old from China has given up, you fool,” he said.
She was too excited, it went like smell, it exploded.
Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second stage of the race at 1:57.79 - a 1.61 second slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed Canadians to reach China.
The viewers in Canada began to speak quickly online and were horrified by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC voter say the 14-year-old swimmer from China “explore”?”
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air.
Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the 4x200-metre women's stadium race was described as: \"The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool-
A Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many demanded his appeal.
When Twitter users found out how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn't stick back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon after, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for the live commentary of MacDonald and said, \"We're sorry for the commentary on the performance of the swimmer who escaped into the broadcast -
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry that it happened -
The CBC station apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russel had to apologize on his behalf.
The CBC then copied and put their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the commentator’s comments.
The station also quickly apologized and published a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, she shouldn't have gotten into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our audiences on the broadcast and to those watching us on social media.
In order to be clear, Byron's comments concerned the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer himself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unhappy choice of words, and Byron apologizes deeply for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on a live broadcast and tried to explain his note by claiming that he did not want her to sound like a personal attack.
“I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women’s team,” he said in an Olympic broadcast at CBC.
“I meant the performance of the swimmer and not the person of the swimmer as such,”
\"There is no need to say that I had no intention of disrespect and I am very sorry -
Customers in Primark are aggravated by a woman who shamelessly tried underwear in the middle of the store
When a woman took off to try her skirt on the sales area in the middle of Primark, the buyers were not sure in which direction to look.
To make it worse, she tried her size, took off her skirt, and returned it back to the rack.
She continued to browse and finally tried four pairs of pants at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Flokestone.
Primark shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where a woman tried her skirt before returning to the rack
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman was “dressing again and leaving the store without buying anything.”
She said, “People couldn’t believe their own eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her skirts off the shelf, took off her own stockings and skirts, and put them on.
\"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she was just standing there, agitating like a monkey -
“Everyone was just looking at how she dressed her skirt again, and apparently she didn’t like it because she brought them back to the rack.”
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn’t like anything, she dressed again and left.
“She seemed to care about who was watching, not even thinking about the person who might be buying the clothes she was trying to buy.”
Miss Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “The idea that someone would take home a skirt that someone else had wearing and no one cleaned it up.
The event occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: “When she left, I collected things that she clearly tried to pull them off the sale - which is also the only thing right -
“I’m afraid I’ll bring my new clothes home and find out that another woman was wearing them, took them off, and that they weren’t washed out.
Prime Minister Primark said: “Primark knows about the incident that occurred in our shop in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9th.
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sales.
How to protect yourself from attacking weapons with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it could be a bit safer for you.
We talked to Rhone Mizrachi, the Grand Master of Krav Magy Federation based in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain supremacy over the abuser, whether it comes close to you from the front or from behind.
If he approaches you from the back, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and “have a free shot track.”
Then you will grab a weapon between your forearm and your shoulder just before you throw it in your face with a free elbow.
Then the knee follows into the groins, and while the assailant shines in the pains, you rub his gun out of his hand, you hit him the main face, and you begin to retreat, while you hold the gun on him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fireline, grab the gun and twist it so that the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, put strength in the weapon and hit the attacker into the chest, then twist the gun from its clamping and begin to retreat, while still pointing at it.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video where you can see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of the robbery - if you are not a Krav Maga superstrem - is to issue all the cash.
Ian Wright explores the most dirty places in Europe into a travel guide
A British traveler has decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and a dazzling reflex - by oiling the dirtyest and most distasteful places in Europe.
Moderator Ian Wright (51), originated from Suffolk, was encircled in his language with a euro banknotes, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on the toilet on the train and a Russian public phone.
Before encircling each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was going to do.
The experiment, on the basis of which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, produced interesting results.
The idea of lurking the flusher button on a train that has been used by thousands of other people may seem completely repulsive, but perhaps in the kitchen sink there are actually many more harmful bacteria.
Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health specialists throughout Europe about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the things that he kissed left anything worse in his mouth than the smell.
Ian Wright was famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on the roads around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely - from public railings on train stations to a flusher
In a film he made about it, he says: “I haven’t taken much care of my health ever since I was a kid, and I’ve had everything possible in my mouth, from clay to worms and mud water.
He confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple wipe, the luminometer showed the value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia, however, refused to kiss after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have made a travel movie called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different locations, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said, “This is almost the coolest thing I’ve ever felt in the toilet.”
There's nothing dirtyer than this!
I'm not going to do anything because it's disgusting here.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help people strengthen intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would track our interest and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that end up with the idea of \"call Ian --
It is said that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon.
Instead of talking only about products, we wanted to put them in broader contexts - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is connected to the immune system.
Growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon, and through this document we have brought more information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there is a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he hugged something of what I wanted after him, like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.
It was much easier for Ian to do some things, and others were hard again.
I'm glad we shot some of the dirty stuff --
In 2015, Valio conducted a survey that found that 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria primarily to stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent of respondents said they at least occasionally used products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of socially needed before eviction destroyed a municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall
A family of socially needed people left £50,000 damage in their municipal home after allegations of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their violent eviction from the house, the housing team officials were shocked when they found out that the property was in an emergency condition.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, garbage was rolling everywhere on the floor, and the walls were dazzled.
The family has already moved away and is believed to live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about saving the house.
She said, “It was a nightmare for people, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property will probably fit into awareness as “not as nice a part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple had three sons who stayed in the house occasionally, and the police said that the horror that the family had had had had was street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding population, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screams, quarrels, and abuses.
Skeldons (47), whose name was given on the lease contract, were sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, odorous garbage has been found.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, there was a torn floor covering
Neighbors say they saw them on the street as they were penned, and people called the police regularly.
Cornwall Houseing has moved her and her partner out of the house this week after they were given an additional 11-week deadline to move out voluntarily.
The neighbors, who were relieved, welcomed the eviction with the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, “They didn’t care about anyone at all.”
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times have we seen the police here, it's impossible to count at all.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.
We got up because there was an incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, supervisory manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were regularly called to the house.
Wastes and old toys were thrown in the mature part of the village house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenants failed to accept responsibility for their own behavior and for the behavior of their family. Emigration is always the last step that Cornwall House is considering.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the Witnesses, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the local community who boldly informed us.
I hope this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time carry a message that we will not tolerate non-social behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenant who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
Contaminated mattresses that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after eviction
Workers will now have to remove piles of garbage that have remained around the house
In 2014, she carried out shelves in her house of stamps and found over 70 grams of hemp, weights, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of holding Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was spent on the foundation of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tina and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth after eviction.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to emigrate tenants who violate the rules of their lease agreements
Angela Crow from Denova and Cornwall police said the eviction was sending a clear message to other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
“This is a message to all those who think they can act impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behavior,” she said.
The Denova and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and non-social behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared of low flight of military jet plane over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun’s rays in Aveira, Portugal, were scared to die.
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion has been flying up to incredibly low.
Military Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted that there was no threat to safety.
The moment the low-flying jet landed above the filled beach, it engulfed the scared tourists of panic.
On dramatic shots, it is seen how the military aircraft reaches almost a touch from the sunny people on a sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after the noise of jet aircraft engines upset them without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon at Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recreationals who posted video recordings of a dramatic flyover on social networks, said: “The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to fall down.
Nuno Arroja adds: “I was surfing, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveira were horrified when a low-flying plane appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify a fishing boat off the coast and had to endure low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The plane reportedly flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that the safety of people was not compromised.
This summer, forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said the pilot had to fly low because of the thick fog and smoke from fires that prevented him from viewing.
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify a fishing vessel as part of the training.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with law.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (ČOI) has found out this during checks in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services do not most often inform the survivors of their prices or issue written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The Czech Republic imposed 41 fines of CZK 73,000.
Today, her spokesperson Jiří Fröhlich informed about this.
The inspectors found errors in 47 out of 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified meter.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 CZK.
This concerned urn packaging, candle covers and vases which were not properly marked with mandatory information.
“Given the fact that there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year,” Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiz Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer, said the family had learned of her death in Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported Thursday that it was probably killed during a Russian airstrike in Austria, which is a bastion group in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just when she was preparing to escape from the war of the plagued country and return to Britain.
“A man wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and warning to others that these are real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone - is that he will discourage people from making decisions ever,” said Akuniee.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London entered Turkey in February 2015 and then entered the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultany family learned that she married an IS fighter in Syria - and she got married within a few months.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, he will leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Democratic Party leader Harry Reid says she believes that Presidential election candidate Hillary Clinton is nominating Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, although President Barack Obama nominated it in March.
The head of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnel, says a person who replaces the late Supreme Court judge will elect a future president.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he thought Clinton would choose Garland \"with some degree of credibility -
Reid's spokesperson later said he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether Garland would be nominated, and that he was just speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to “get a boat”
Garland is the President of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans who block Garland’s appointment were “employees” and “a jump” Republican candidate for Donald Trump’s presidential office.
He said Trump wasn't in office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars are for \"women and men\"
The Treats magazine works closely with photographer David Bellemer to release a calendar for 2017, inspired by the calendar Pirelli of the 1970s.
But instead of revealed famous personalities, he tries to find another generation of top models for his 2017 NU Muses calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nudity magazine is different from Playboy from the old school because \"Playboy is for men.\"
I'm doing it for women.
Apparently, the calendar also thinks.
“We have to go back to depicting timeless and classic nudity, when women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by the photographs of the woman’s body,” Shaw said in a statement.
Women want to be part of this project, because it is a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their photos online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys turntables?
Vinyls love lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to fill in the comments section with pepper notes under the pseudonym of NeViVímíMežíMežíMežíMežíMežníMežíMežíMežníMežníMežníMežníMežníMežníMežníMežníMežníMežníMežníMežníMežší, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the so-discussed resurrection of turntables is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to love the originality of the possession of a physical object, but with the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who have recently bought a vinyl album are most likely to be people aged between 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are least likely.
In fact, it’s not about the accumulation of an enthusiastic fan: older people who buy turntables are more likely to want to preserve their feelings (56% versus 53%) and they like to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouG's true?
If this blog was broadcast as a TV reportage, the camera would watch me head out into a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent grey suit and gesticulate widely. Then I would stop, pull my hands and say something authoritative, like: “Let’s look at it.”
Let's take a look at this.
While his charm and charm are slowly lost from Soho's heart - buildings once occupied by independent vendors, they are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, confections and office needs - several fantastic specialized turntable shops remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, who I watch from Sister Ray (counts: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counts: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and is looking at shops to fill in a few hours of time.
I ask him if he's a collector.
“I think so,” he says.
I have about 3 or 4,000 recordings.
All these recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he sent me the photo by email, I did not track it home).
This huge amount of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy turntables that he could not afford when they came out originally, and he re-buys what he sold in his youth and didn’t even have a vindra.
“A lot of what I’m buying is from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These are things that would be released when I was 11 or 12. Then I was too small and couldn’t get them,” she says.
They agree that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who love the company of themselves. And he adds: \"I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers she meets fit into the profile of YouGov.
He also noticed a new tide of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about comeback and felt forced to buy their old turntables back.
According to my interviews, the people of their collections were most often deprived between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their turntables and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their turntables back,” he says.
This could explain the boom of lovers of turntables of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of turntables?
It won’t take you more than a few seconds to discover in a store like Phonica that you will find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts in music stores.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly aggravated by the system of contactless payments.
Some adherents of turntables may feel engulfed in the digital world and opted for the familiar environment of turntable packaging, things that provoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling in a gap or possessing something material can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I think that's the case with a lot of people, too.
It’s an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We are all like their social workers,” a co-worker calls from a pile of turntables.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier have not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of those surveyed have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables don’t have a turntable.
At this point in the reportage, he was probably seriously concerned about walking through the pile of compilation bossa nova.
The aspect of \"trophies - and recovery of interest - is something Jonny noticed (42), who works in the Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
“Someone recently came up and said, ‘I don’t have a turntable yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead so we can put it on the shelf,’ he says.
The percentage is not big, but it happens.
This is more about a product page than about music.
People come to us saying, “I don’t have a turntable.
These are the younger people, not the older ones, the grown-up teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for turntables, has much more diverse visitors at my arrival.
There are a couple of 70-year-olds, tourists who take photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops before - from the speakers, instead of pulling jazz, the latest pop from the Wild Beasts is heard full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them appear to be particularly lonely, but you can hardly estimate the turbulent mental trauma when you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks a few minutes in Fopp and views various turntables in the discount.
She is one of those who sees expenses rather than spending heat.
She doesn’t make much money, so she doesn’t think she’s collecting turntables.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something like that, but the turntables have their magic... - they sigh eagerly.
I can't explain - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that allegedly inspired a new generation of Gramophone lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I'm pretending to be a very biased little girl in tight jeans and I'm watching a group of teenage girls who are just gathering around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's turntable.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which covers the turntables of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classic music, the basis of any average collection of turntables.
No one is looking at them - perhaps just because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's a purely \"vinyl trick\"
But because any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depths of Soho for the next one, there is not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that a demographic area where there is more time and money than in other areas is also where it is spent most for the most luxurious goods, which vinyl certainly is.
But while, according to my findings, the results of YouGov seem to be accurate - that is, at least in the shops with turntables, they do not take into account a large number of collectors and lovers of vinyl, who exist in fact, in shops with turntables and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly doesn’t spend Thursday morning walking around the store with turntables on Berwick Street, going through recordings and avoiding looking at a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV moderator hiding behind the back of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five meters.
French court refuses to break down trades in Jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the order of authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 provisional shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cutting, sell tea in temporary restaurants for 50 cents or basic dishes for several euros.
The Prefect Office in Calais argued that the sites had to be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay taxes and because they meant the danger of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations have stated in court that shops and restaurants are vital and that free food offered by the state-backed association and other groups do not provide food supplementation for increasing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Disputed temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 provisional trades, but stated that the objections to the Calais Prefect were “extremely understandable.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said food stores, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role than just feeding food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of democracies was a cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a nonprofit organization that offers 200 meals daily, English and French classes, and asylum counselling for hundreds of vulnerable minors without accompanying in the camp.
“Children’s cafes have been signed by more than 170,000 people.
The Guardian received a letter saying the closing of the coffee shop would “be a disaster for these children, some of which are only 8 years old.”
The charity Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after the steep rise in arrivals during the summer has increased to more than 9,000 - which is so far the most all-time.
He thought he was dead.
The Utch raises itself and the Volleyball Usti.
“Since March I have been able to train normally,” he said at the start of the summer training in full force.
What's wrong with you?
I had a two-sided pulmonary embolia, and then I had heart problems.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my mouth for two years and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, no one found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
The vein is damaged in the mouth, it will hurt all the time, especially when the weather is moving or changing.
But nothing that would limit me is more of aesthetic.
Were you worried about your life?
He should have.
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevenice I didn’t know I had an embolia, and I couldn’t move there anymore.
I returned my blood tonight.
The doctors told me that it was something completely different, I was completely finished for five days.
I really thought in Dřevenice I was dead, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you compare to that?
I guess I had to get through it, now it's just going up.
I know I have some blood problems, I have to watch out more when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Only when I wanted to go back to Příbrami last year, there were still heart problems.
Now everything's fine.
Since March, I’ve been preparing for myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it, physically I'm better off than before.
What do you expect from Usti?
I look forward to seeing most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
I hope we sit human to fit together.
Will you lift the mouth?
She had a reputation for being fat, but each season is different.
Brno was eight years ago, and now the second one is over.
There's a new team in Usti, there's only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extralize, so there's plenty of room to improve.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first laps, who's going to be an abyss, we're not.
Is coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already experienced a lot, he'll think better than the last place.
But my arrival was not related to him, I agreed earlier.
There were other trainers in the game, with one I was a great friend and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say a name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came, and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for decades, he's a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to run, and I like to get an opportunity in not such a top team.
I’ve been in Příbrami for two years, but it’s a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned strangers, already training Australian Boehm.
What does it look like?
I know him by the way, at the university we played against each other in a group.
And a couple of times we had fun there, sometimes we sat together in the evening after the games, so we already know each other friendlyly.
We defeated them 3:1, at the start of the summer preparations in Usti.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with an American, he looks like a good boy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted an American?
It felt like a good idea.
I'm a recording player, that is, the one who creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of player it was, I found on the internet, how he plays, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the boy was jumping, he was tall.
On Facebook, we wrote a couple of messages, seemed like a joker, fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to recording number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only twenty-four, and I don't have a character to change it.
I'd rather be in the center of the event, and I'd rather have a team than someone else's.
I don't think I'd want to play anymore if I were to be a second recordr and do it for full time.
How many times have you been one?
Half a year in Příbram, when it didn't go to Kust as captain, he was injured, then there were problems with money, and he left.
Since then, we’ve been up and I’ve been playing all the time.
In Brno, which I am a breeder, I replaced the one and the two.
A great year was in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and chose Příbram.
From there, Budejovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolia.
Now it's a new start.
Gold number 22.
A short position remains a Phelps domain.
“To be back on the stage of the winners and to hear the anthem is sweet as always,” Phelps laughed and again had his eyes full of tears.
His wife and mother grinned again in sight, the son of Boomer slept calmly this time with headphones on his ears.
I'm going through an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming and in a few hours it'll be over, he said in a word.
In the finals behind Phelps for almost two seconds, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long position.
Bronz won the Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year’s World Championship.
After Al Oerter (discussion) and Carl Lewis (long distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to have mastered the same discipline on four games in a row.
For most of the race, another American Ryan Lochte and domestic Thiago Perreira held the Phelps.
While the gold defender in the final round 50 put on the crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the solemn announcement of the position, he moved to the final of the race on 100 meters of butterflies.
The legend could not be overshadowed by the compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the sign double - he won a double track in Rio after a hundred.
In the final, he left 37 sets of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin behind, the third ended Rus Yevgeny Rylov.
While Murphy has only the fifth place in two hundred last year’s World Cup, he has become a signatory king in Rio.
Larkina took down from the ingenious throne, to whom the same double was successful at last year’s World Championship.
He won the medal at the Olympics only now.
The Canadian Penny Oleksiaková and American Simone Manuel shared gold on the Kraular Hundred.
For 16-year-old Oleksia, it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel's second after the stage silver.
Swimming gold was the first African-American ever to win on OH.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for all who come after me, the sport becomes love for them, and they get to where I am, said the touched Manuel.
The third was Sweden’s Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-metre butterfly race in Rio in the world record and still has silver from the Kraula two hundred.
At the end of the sixth year, Australian woman Cate Campbell ended.
It was won by Japan's Rie Kanet, for which it was the first Olympic medal at the age of twenty-seven.
It has no precious metal or world championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia by Julia Jefimov, who, despite the doping past, faced with the hostility of both viewers and opponents.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
I'm so tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was only enforced by the special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or whether he has a different opinion, whether he turns to the arbitration court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And the start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
Just less than an hour before the match, they found out who he was going to be against.
They must have been able to handle tactical preparation.
And then, in an unconventional time, they started a match in a small court number 1.
The first set did not start well, then they took the lead of the opponents, but in the state of 19:19 they did not manage the ending.
In the second they were clearly better and compared, but the decisive tie-break did not come out.
First of all, a number of services that were shown meant to lose 10:15 and to say goodbye to the Olympic tournament.
“We could have defeated the Russians,” Hermann said.
How would you evaluate the game?
Hermann: After a bad start before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end of the last balloon, I missed the income I had used to before.
We lost the set, which was key.
In the next set, we came to them with an overview on the field, another defense, and we pressed on the service.
In the tiebreak there was a lot of spoiled administration, there we took this side.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat the Russians.
Sluková: The shame of the beginning of the first set, there we ran away.
We were able to download it, but the dots were missing.
The second set was great, and in the third it was decided service.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and it was about the five, we hesitated a lot.
It’s a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the small yard number one?
Sluková: Same as in China in the by-doors.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one hour at night, completely quiet, the music didn't play, nothing.
That was the difference from the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was weird.
We started to practice for a game without knowing the anti-gamers, so we couldn’t make a tactical preparation like other teams.
But Simon (Nausch) prepared a tactic for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactic paper ready, so on this side we were pretty well prepared.
Do you ever start a game at midnight?
Hermann: I don't think so.
We played at 11:30, but not at 12.
bloc Russian Birlov in front of the playoff on the OH in Rio.
Beach Volleyballists Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in a hug in front of the playoff at OH in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group from ten, we had the regime shifted earlier.
That was two more hours.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance at 12 o’clock.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be like that, but it's not very typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Because the progress from the group was our goal, it's all right on the one hand.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I’ll get out of it, and I’ll only remember the Olympic tournament positively from tomorrow.
Big brother's here, comes the first spying SIM.
You won't escape her.
The new rules apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM of one of the local operators while in Thailand.
Not only for tourists, but also for those with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or have married there.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, said there would be no exceptions.
The plan for the sale of SIM intended exclusively for foreigners was introduced by the national telecommunications regulator in early August.
New measures to enable monitoring of their location will be put in place by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security that will allow the treatment of criminal activities committed by foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs are designed to help detect people who exceed the allowed length of stay.
In addition to the SIM intended exclusively for Thais, salesmen should have a special SIM for foreigners within half a year.
The tracking function that will be permanently switched on for cards intended for persons without a Thai passport will differ.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
“This function in SIM is not for Thailand, because you can always follow it easily,” added Tantasith.
It is necessary to add that in Thailand, subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires a proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators was giving free start-up SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is also considering ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia or Singapore.
They are currently subject to mandatory registration of SIM, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the measures envisaged do not require foreigners to acquire a local operator when entering the country of the SIM.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case Thai authorities will be short on them.
After crossing the border, the operators of the country, i.e. after logging in to their network, only relevant network information is known.
They know the phone number, but not the owner’s information.
However, the difference between roaming prices and local operators’ rates is so abyss that most tourists will also start looking at local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to oversee the movement of foreigners have been legally criticised by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in connection with privacy protection, the planned system compares to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if there is a need to monitor a particular person.
For any abuse of the system, there will be a threat of a more insidious punishment.
“If the service provider monitors the location of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a crime,” Tantasith said.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While there is currently a recycling of a specific number only after the 90-day period after which the SIM did not log in to the network, it could be renewed after fifteen days in the case of leaving Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the property care will be provided by the administrator.
The condition was sufficient parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking the floor, high energy intensity and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is unable to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern apartment.
The whole interior was designed by architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Poláková from the studio Artiga.
Why did you just address them?
Would you recommend working with an expert?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone, if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the design of the interior itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials, and on the basis of the client's wishes, they are able to fit the interior accordingly.
We worked with architect Lenka Langerová already on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, there was a clear choice for us even in the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous socio-living space with a suitable background for a four-member family conceived as a modern but not a cool interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with terraces and to realize intelligent control of the home.
And, of course, the quality of the design had to be carbonized.
Did you leave everything to the experts or did you interfere with the final form of the interior?
We have approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design has always come from architects.
At the beginning, we decided what we expected of the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it was our collection of mainly Czech authors including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vyšil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund that helped architects to orient themselves in our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and nutwood was the idea of an architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We verified together with visualizations.
Have there been any complications in the implementation of which you had to give up your original ideas or, on the contrary, come up with a new one?
Perhaps only at the initial stage of the project, when we came to the building at the moment when it was first possible to climb up to the height of our floor, and found that the views we had planned actually shadowed the surrounding buildings.
At that time, we literally changed the layout overnight from the ground up.
Granite was used on the kitchen and on the wall of the fireplace.
In the interior, the wooden surfaces of the supplemented skin, for example, on the upholstery of the dining and bar chairs Norma from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make some changes or is there anything you would like to have today?
I think it is a modern air interior, which primarily fulfills its purpose.
We do not plan to change, most of the adjustments after moving in took place in the level of shielding and housing of the terrace.
Perhaps the only tip is to the floor, when nutwood shows itself to us as too delicate to the house with a dog.
Slovak architect, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the implementation.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout solution and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior is an important element of the location of the luminaires in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
This gave us daylight in the darker space of the apartment.
Also direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the entire apartment.
It also includes a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to French, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, a short distance from the Spanish border.
I moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, so I got to work in one magazine.
Why did you decide to move out of the country?
I started to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere among people.
I thought every French man was so negative.
People in France are negatively tuned in general, but it has been getting worse lately.
It’s interesting that you mention negativism.
This is how some people evaluate the Czech nature.
Believe me, you are not negative compared to the French.
It may not happen to some people when they come to France because they don’t see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
A big issue is money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
There is also a problem with people’s behaviour towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible for me.
For example, in the street I lived in, my non-Muslim neighbor started to look at me through my fingers just because I am a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and I came across a job with Air France here in Prague.
I didn’t know from the beginning of Prague.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn’t even know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it’s because I don’t speak Czech, so I can’t capture some negative reactions or abuses, but I feel like people are freer here.
That I can do anything, dress any way, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you uncomfortablely, for example, when you have special clothes and the like.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think people care about this kind of thing.
Where are you working now?
After working in Air France, I worked for one travel website for a while.
Then, with one more friend, we founded websites on which people offer and search for shared housing.
So far we are only in Prague, but we would like to expand it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs from the middle, and two other Czechs friends.
I have to say that another specific of the Czechs is that they initially hold more distance.
He's not gonna let someone get to the body right away.
That’s quite different from where I grew up.
In the south they all hug and kiss their face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don’t speak English.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it very simple in Prague, because maybe everyone is speaking English here.
Even at dinners or in food.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don’t have that much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little in English, I don’t have the need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you met any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Actually, no.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
I have one experience of attacking me.
My manager, Czecha, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They are not French, but Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But that someone had a problem with being a Muslim has not yet happened to me.
Even though my colleague once warned me of some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said I'm not going to the center to be there.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar like that in Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that today anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I could not imagine that such a thing would have happened in France.
This is not just about Muslims.
Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur’an says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you see it when terrorists are stunned by your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel cold and guilty, even if I shouldn’t feel like it.
I try not to track the news of violence much, but every time I read something, I have a need to apologize for something that is not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at Jiří's Square from Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians protested against violence.
Did you sign up?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a little more religious than I do, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam, because we all perceive it a little different.
I come from France, so I went through other educations, and they taught Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
Islam is sometimes associated with the submissive position of a woman.
How do you feel?
I don't feel submissive in any way.
Rather, on the contrary.
I am a woman, I have strength.
It is also related to the fact that you do not wear any head cover.
For example, hijab?
This is mainly the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a very basic Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she just doesn’t wear a salad.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone who interprets it.
When one reads the Qur’an, one should make one’s own opinion on these things.
So when I read in the Qur’an a passage that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, I am not the wife of the Prophet, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect it, and when I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the scarves require it, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I was thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is an ideal city for this.
The Czech Muslims, together with the Christians, demonstrated against violence.
The Kozel Fencl's yacht in Rio was set on the podiums.
Friday at sea in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, was released by Czech yachter Veronica Kozelská Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to 10th place before the final two races.
This would ensure the participation in the final ride.
Packs are collected as pokemons.
They want to compete with carriers.
The idea behind using the already planned journeys for the transport of shipments is the TV director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea of inhaling the life of three applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the national transport application in May.
At the moment, thousands of cities are being recorded and we will be expanding the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first, rather than focusing more on abroad, says in an interview for iDNES.cz one-four-year-old manager.
How does the Transport app work and who can benefit from it?
You can download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data, how big the package you can carry and how much you want for it.
Someone's asking for a ride again that day.
When the route and delivery time match, it pairs up and both come with mutual notifications.
At that moment, the chat opens, where the couple arranges a handover.
How many people would you think would have to register to always find their own courier?
I don’t know the ideal condition, I can’t guess how many registered and how many roads it takes to cover it perfectly optimal and each offer paired with demand.
The main questions are already working and it is logically easier than on the way between villages.
The more people, the greater the speed and accuracy potential.
People are also building trust and finding that no one is running away with the package.
So far you didn't have to deal with such a case?
How many users have a service after two months of startup?
We currently have about 5 to 6,000 people creating roads.
We consider this to be a success, and we believe that others will be packed.
Is it not necessary that the sender waits too long?
We hope to be a competition for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the thing for the same day and for a fraction of the price.
For a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
You’ll pay 100 or less here, because that’s the way someone’s already doing business.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the potential loss of customers in the future?
We hope that's the case.
The market has enormous potential, feeding large multinational carriers here, as well as trading chains where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality is not responsible for what it pays for.
No one wants to find a ticket in the mailbox with a message that he has to pick up a shipment at his office, first that day after 19.
At that time, I needed the package for six hours and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won’t upset anyone and sends a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
No one has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as the manager of the music club, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they began preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses the already planned journeys between the world’s capitals, especially the aircraft.
In 2015, they entered a project to process a company that created applications such as MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of the year and the application was launched in March 2016.
The transfer service began to develop in December last year and they issued this year in May.
This is a local version of Shippansee modified for the Czech market.
The Mesík and the Mesík Profi have been developing since this January and have made it available to users at the end of July 2016.
From the beginning, it was intended to do all these applications that would one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application, and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, they want to focus more on the global market.
The shared economy is a topic recently, and this is a service of the type AirBnB or Uber.
Don’t you worry about acting in an area that no one can yet tell you about, where is the border of sharing and where is the gray economy?
It's the same, no other product.
We are clear that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the eye through the gray economy.
But even though someone saves and earns money, it is not intended to bypass financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, on one or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make it.
What do you think the service has so much potential?
The sender saves and the carrier earns, or reduces the cost of travel.
This is the strong idea that combines interest on both sides.
In the time of social networks that divide people, we would like this to bring them closer together.
There may be nice stories, people are happy to help someone and tell about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
I think people have been missing a personal approach for a long time, we say about this application that it is a service to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier won’t run away with the package?
Each user of the application, together with registration, scans the ID card and gives a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give service and credibility to man.
Couriers also collect stars based on sender ratings.
We will also offer insurance, we will match the details.
The courier is liable for uninsured shipments in case of loss or damage but does not accept criminal liability for content if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find him in a closed package in his trunk of a machine gun or ten kilos of hash, the criminal liability on the sender is overturned.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
They are registered, if necessary, by a supervisory administrative authority, which is the only one who will have the opportunity to look into it, and we ourselves are unable to see it, the data is protected against abuse.
How much money does a courier get after a successful delivery?
The courier determines the price and gets the whole amount he says.
In addition, the sender is charged several percent for mediating the contact.
This money is our profit, but it’s only a few percent because we want to push the volume.
No one can blame the courier for not adding the shipment when he actually delivered it, taking over and delivering it is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
In relation to the size or content of the package?
You can move anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plate of eggs and large as a bass beer.
Then there are no more restrictions and if someone has a seat in the car, he will take over the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don’t even have to pack if you don’t want to hide content.
You put the forgotten sweatshirt in your hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to run the service?
A friend got an idea more than two years ago, then I didn’t pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo app with a transnational reach, which targets mainly passengers by plane.
At that point, I told him I wasn’t going to look for an investor, but I would like to become an investor myself and put savings into it.
The next year, we continued to develop more than we founded Shippansee LTD in London due to greater credibility of the entire product.
This is not the version you are focusing on now.
No, we focused on Czech Republic, where we try to catch the application, because it had all the birth pain and there is still something to do and improve.
We are trying to respond to customer feedback and we are currently not dealing with the foreign market so much.
We know it’s a long track, but we don’t know, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way upgraded.
The transfer was created when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the Moon is local, for the city.
But it can send the package to the exact address and the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Carrier, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your mobile.
The app for couriers who want to feed on it was called the Mesik Profi.
So someone can earn extra money by picking up packages around the city?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to take a trip to work.
Now, like everybody who's stupid with these pokémons, they can collect this all the same.
A person sees where there are orders around the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it must be delivered and carries the shipment.
It is set cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we are still working on a web interface that will be essential for companies to send shipments, on the site will fill in data about them, or create points on the map.
We are able to make use of the service every month.
Are you currently doing the full-time project?
It makes us feel good, but we have it normally at work so that we can feed and develop the project.
There is no hidden multinational investor behind us, we are two boys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other stimuli and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to be able to compete with us not the Czech market, but who should go with us to the global product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
Titanfall 2 is intended to bring almost forgotten growth.
This will correct the second part and the solo game in it will be more varied according to the first information than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours, and the filling should be based on the concept of network plug-in in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to the freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, includes the possibility of using combat titanium.
In addition to action passages, the game will also include levels focused on agile movement.
They will resemble platformers and include rébuses.
To overcome them, for example, double jumps, running walls and rope slides are essential.
In addition, it will sometimes be necessary to destroy enemies.
There will also be no missing maps resembling mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one example, it will be possible to lift and slide platforms and close a massive door.
You will adjust the form of the battlefield.
As a result, the pace of the game should oscillate between fierce action and calmer moments for exploring the unknown planet.
We're going to play for Jack Cooper's pouch, dreaming of a pilot's career.
Cooper, along with Captain Lastimosa, will crash on the extraterrestrial planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there will be no wilderness to him.
In addition, the Lastimosa will tear down deadly wounds in the crash, and Cooper will be tasked with running Captain Titanium.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true before he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot repair.
Cooper's calls to titanium will also be significant.
Players will serve as a source of information about the soldier’s past, but at the same time, robot-seated communications will create humorous moments.
For example, when titanium will name all the injuries that Cooper is at risk of a planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 came from the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be possible to assess in two months, and the Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is released on October 28th for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will come to life, but the original label remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ, in 2013 it gained a number of its brands and the right to use both the logo and the company name.
Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 more games have been created for the publishing industry and 13 of them have not yet been revealed.
Thirty years ago, at the time I retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a 20-year-old younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first apparently she tried for a long time, then they got together.
She's such a big guy, probably her type, because she was dating a similar guy in front of me.
She went crazy about him.
In those first days, she even changed her voice, had such a girlly, in love with her voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
I watched it all.
At that time, he went from work regularly at half a fourth, so she always left at three for purchase.
Every day she tried to see him at least.
I later found out that they were meeting him in the house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there.
I got my keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I've always stayed home.
I've never been able to go there, make a decisive move.
Maybe you'll laugh at me, but I believe my wife was mindful of me.
I think she soon found out that I was controllable to do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a baccarat.
The neighbors told me that he knew it too.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
That in the family it would all fall, only a daughter knew something.
So I've always postponed it, go on and on.
But one day I went to his apartment to get help with something in the laundry room.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got anonymized, that he was dating my wife and that he was witnessing it all.
I asked him what he would say.
He stood there, shrugged his shoulders, looked into the ground, and said no word.
At that time, I met his wife on the way out of the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me anything either.
No one told me anything at the time.
I'm the kind of person who's never gone anywhere so far who's having trouble getting to know someone, let alone find a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I was still relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her all this and life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've basically never dealt with all of this.
I still have it in me today.
I used to tell her a lot, but eventually I left it alone.
He's still living in a side house, and I'm still living with her.
It's more than my wife's pub.
At home, she always did everything - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's busy.
I think she always tried to make me have no other reason to complain.
And it can be said that she is good.
But sometimes I want to fuck her, hug her, and she won't leave.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks about how happy we are to have a marriage.
She once told me she never loved me.
She loved me and loved me, but she didn’t love me.
And I can see that he still loves him today, he's her god.
And I don't like that kind of life.
As soon as it started, and I carried it very badly, I once told her that I didn’t want to live and asked what she would say if I ended up.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought, and finally she said, \"But there's plenty of room here.\"
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslims.
Following terrorist attacks, France is increasing the fight against radical Islamists and calling for help from both the government and the local Muslim minority.
“If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly harder for France to guarantee freedom of religion,” said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop financing mosques from abroad, when jihad-vaccinated preachers often come with money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslims.
The new institution will replace the current French Islamic Foundation, founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It had already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
However, it was soon hit by internal contradictions, and it never worked properly.
“It’s a total failure,” Valls said.
At the head of the new foundation, former Interior and Defence Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state, appears to be the leader of the new foundation.
There are about 2500 mosques and prayers in France, about 120 of them serving radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clerics from the country and are considering this step for several other decades.
This week, German police also attacked jihadist spiritualists.
The Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Right after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate on a new institution was set up in France to replace the non-functional foundation.
All of this has been accomplished by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to secure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to oversee imams.
However, it is not yet clear where he will get funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee on halal food, i.e. meat derived from defeats according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by the sellers halal food, for granting permission.
Some of the money would then go to the budget of the foundation.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who will go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 people travel to Saudi Arabia from France.
In addition, there should be only preachers in the French mosques who have undergone educational programs at the universities there.
As a result, their preaching should be in line with democracy.
The government also closes the radical mosques.
“We have closed 20 since December and others will follow,” Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
“There is no place in France for those who proclaim hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men,” he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at a shopping mall in Zaragoza, Spain, according to the Independent newspaper.
The shooting occurred after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man waited in the car before the shopping mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes Independent.
A woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to arrive for a man in critical condition.
The crime occurred around 11 a.m. in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous area of Aragon, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably an unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Coils with bristle, wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
The summer wishes light, well digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our own taste and our head.
And so from the summer gardens smells grilled necks, boulevards, pork pins.
Not very healthy, not very light, but sometimes except salad or baked vegetables.
True, grilling is economical for time and dishes, in addition, it is a social matter and no one has to be locked up in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to how to do well with snacks, which special dining, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or suffocate for a long time.
And they're going to help us get better.
Whether it's home sushi or sashimi, where high-quality raw materials and a few well-received grips are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here even more time-consuming cooking and cooling rice is lost.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment, and then it depends only on the imagination of the cook, as he intends to play with the fillings and accessories.
It's not like algae.
The advantage of a variety of Asian cuisines is that raw materials are generally already available.
Included sweet-acid ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the true pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and at the same time delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several kinds of vinegar and ginger.
Therefore, it is enough to buy a bag of adequate size, and the attachment with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is done.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes on various solemn occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed banana leaves are very widespread in many countries of Asia or South America as a “help” to prepare a variety of baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed in them as well as in alobal.
The banana leaf then gives the dish a specific flavor.
With us you can buy in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even in advance cut into the shape of wheels.
However, choose only green leaves, and therefore healthy - uncracked and without stains.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare salad from algae wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be purchased frozen again.
Anyone who often eats or prepares sushi will probably know especially the algae of nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - that is, slices intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame’s dark green eyelashes growing in water around Hokkaido’s island are also fresh and dried and are as popular as the nori eyelashes.
By the way, who would not know the bowl of soup with wakame, allegedly Asian women use it to recover after childbirth.
And at all, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses blood, strengthens blood circulation, even allegedly prevents graying of hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and dispersed wakame also serves as spices, for example, to taste rice.
Fresh eyelashes are first allowed to exfoliate in water, then rinse, put in boiling water and cook for half a minute.
Then it cools in ice water, cuts off the center ribs and continues to adjust, such as a favorite salad.
However, to buy it already finished, frozen, is the easiest solution.
Therefore, it is only necessary to get a roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a long-lasting bomb.
If you resist and do not throw extra grilled boulevards.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that deliciously combines flavors.
And it's done once.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white radish, 100 g green asparagus, 60 g salad cucumbers, 60 g wakame eyelashes and 60 g sweet chilli sauces.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a spoon of Sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of manga and 40 g of grated gari ginger, a little bit of pine nuts.
First, we'll prepare the coils.
Soak the rice paper for five seconds in cold water.
Then take it out and wait until it softens.
In the meantime, in hot water, shortly heat the baptismal shoots, after about three minutes, let them cool quickly into the ice water, so as not to lose color.

Britain must be satisfied with silver in seven rugby, choosing Fiji takes gold
The impressive performance of the UK in the seven-story rugby ended with a devastating track on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated the British at the Deodoro Stadium on Thursday night, at Rio 43:7.
The Fijis presented a master's lesson in processing, landfills, bends, support game, running on a rope and brutal forces - and they won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unwitting price of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third on that day - and the British could have been proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of the seven-knit rugby, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Winned victory over South Africans 7:5 in the semifinals the same day, is perhaps frozen in the final.
However, Fiji would also defeat a 15-member team in full health.
The best writing for the British will not be a comfort, but they may be glad that at least one of them will have a gold medal tomorrow around his neck: the chief coach of the Fijis is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
The UK has insulted a bit of the way.
Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game in Adelaide Sevens.
The only one lost here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is irrefutable.
Fiji began spectacularly, British penetrations were reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and other players, it was like running behind a number of buses in motion and the World Cup champions led 5:0 when Osea Cologne emerged from behind the corner.
The timer showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain was hard to touch the ball.
Great Mitchel tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only Fiji slowed down.
In the seventh minute, he threw Jasa Veremalua touchdown into the right corner, and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after his return, and there was still more than 1 minute left in the hours... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouva then penetrated the tiny British and put himself on the bar where he scored.
After the conversion to 29:0, the break followed.
It was as if Fiji for the rugby 7s were born while the British were still learning the handover.
That's how it is.
After a half-time, the British made mass changes and the crackdown of the Fijis stopped... for a whole four minutes, which was good compared to the first half-life, until after the brilliant interplay of Fiji Josua Tuis had continued.
Dan Norton tried to get the opportunity for the British, throwing touchdown into the left corner to raise the 36:7. But long ago, the inhabitants of the Pacific islands won the match, and their fans sang, waving flags, and dancing.
It was hard not to admire the totally joyous approach of the Fijis.
At the end of the day, Mata Viliame had yet another attempt to win the Fijis.
A whistle was heard, the Fijis hugged, and the British fell completely into the lawn.
Even earlier, the same day Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in the semifinals, and the United Kingdom defeated the South African Republic in a close semi-final - the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half of his lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
Marcus Watson's great late landfill, Anthony's brother from the 15th England team, won - and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win a rowing race inspired the fight of a cancer coach
You won't find more emotional gold on these Games - and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing breathtakings into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
There were three voices in the boat, though there were two at the party. When the ship ran across the surface to meet the other Olympic gold behind them in the race of women's pairs, there was still a voice in the boat of coach Robin Williams. They were the first women in the history of British sports to achieve such a result.
Their predominance was absolute, in total it was their 39th race in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes, how the water level flies with the elegance of the swan - does not reflect the nature of the victory completely.
For every gold medal from rowing, the battle is an auxiliary hand that means a little bit of a difference. And no hands have been helped more than the hands of a coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he would live this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his words, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer, which can be operated, and I underwent this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It will change your view of the thing.
Cancer was detected by Williams in December 2013.
Happiness for the whole trio was that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, off-season, thus shortening the downturn to a minimum - if we can call it under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked in the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
rowing in itself is a journey, but this was a bit more difficult.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual, as he tried to manage his own unrest.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who has a mission in Aghanistan, said: “This week I’ve been on the bottom with emotions, maybe it’s a little extreme, but it means so much.
Again, it emphasizes how much it means to me how much Helen and I worked with Robin.
Until now, it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he's a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose the only race in five years.
The pair put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not cope with.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We focused as much as possible at that moment.
Helen shouted, “Don’t stop, don’t stop.”
It is really important not to be carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn’t want to achieve something fantastic.
We didn't look forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to have a good celebration, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to decide what will happen next.
Glover is getting married next week, with her upcoming TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
I feel much better about it,” she said.

Prison?
Rather, let the people ride for free, says taximafie hunter Rubes to a breakthrough charge.
Six taxi drivers and a former lawmaker in Prague are, as ČT said, accused.
You have recorded a number of reports in which you have revealed fraudulent practices and those to be in the group that will stand before the court.
You were faced with a few unpleasant fights with revealed actors.
How much is the report on the prosecution of members of the organized group a breakthrough for you?
I thought there might be a trial.
I am curious about the judgment.
I don't think they should be in prison.
It's useless.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should be returned so that they will carry all the people for free.
This is a rather self-evident solution.
Does this mean that you do not see any punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so afraid that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a pingla, the other takes out pizza and one goes completely out of it.
The defendants may, in theory, receive two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with losing my freedom.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Close someone to prison, especially in this case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the companies that took her.
For the fourth century they committed that they had destroyed our country's name and robbed people.
So let them now make a good card and distribute people for free.
I can't imagine.
It would work as a public benefit.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they would get a car and free of charge they would drive people around Prague.
No, I really think they're gonna get a condition and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and then at Tomáš Bati University in Zlín.
It belongs to people who in the Czech Republic started with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
She works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where she participates in a number of shows, she is now preparing the Prague Guide, which is primarily designed for foreign viewers.
By means of short reports, Rubes advises on what services he prefers to avoid in Prague and which, on the contrary, he recommends to use without fear.
Previously filmed a series called How To, City of Scams?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Prahy.
They are referred to as an organized group.
The police followed her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be called a mafia?
They're such cute mafias, not the ones we know from the Godfather.
It is more about the mafias - juniors, but the organizations are sure.
It is only in the fact that they guard each other's stadiums (taxi-tax stations).
Prague is completely scattered.
I followed that, for example, the main station does not like Parisian, the Parisian does not like himself again with taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Vary (disco club)
Everyone is just keeping an eye on their place, and each group is organized.
It seems to be a complex network.
But there are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former Magistrate official who warned the driver of checks.
As you say, the unwanted phenomenon from the streets has not disappeared.
So, what percentage of the fraudsters in the taxi service is your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still there.
For example, I'm talking about Aleš Ryjáček.
This is a man who is really dangerous - in his car a telescopic shoe, and every Friday and Saturday stands at the Charles Bridge and carries people.
When I last went with him, he wanted me seven hundred and three miles.
For some reason, his police didn't stop.
Just a couple of people from all over the big group.
The same is true in other locations in Prague.
Thus, with the charge of seven people, it is difficult to eliminate the already famous Prague insolvencies, which seems to have much larger dimensions.
Of course, it's not for nothing.
It will help, but all evil will not be eliminated, that is true.
Are taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists still in the same places you showed in the reports, that is, at the Charles Bridge or in the Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these places every day and break the decrees every day.
It ignores both the City Police and the Prague Magistrate.
It's not a cat anymore, but a complete indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
However, some of them, although only part of the group, will be brought to court.
It's a breakthrough.
I have to ask, do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be, to improve the centre of Prague.
And even if I feel like I need a little better, I will continue to do so.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief remains, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But that’s not the case, of course, there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them in tax?
Sometimes I do test rides and I have to say it's still bad.
I just caught a taxi driver last week, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged himself 560 crowns per three kilometers, although he then claimed it was 56 crowns (he used a trick with a decimal line).
He had a receipt, the police arrived, and this taxi driver was so cute that he was still following those policemen and asking them when someone finally gave him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver stuck a decimal line on the taxi meter and robbed tourists of CZK 357.
It can be said that the hostility of fraudulent taxi drivers did not give up even after you showed in your shots the faces of those who charged absurd amounts for a short ride?
Their bitterness is still incredible.
How did that taxi driver get 56 crowns?
The police sent him away with the fact that they could not discuss with him on the spot because he exposed the receipt.
And that will be, I think, a problem even in that court (six taxi drivers and one exuary).
On the one hand, there will be a taxi driver with his bills, on the other side of the police.
However, according to the Supreme Administrative Court’s ruling, the Magistrate may not use secret records from a taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I filmed parts about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves warned me of this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the pictures to report.
Are you concerned that this could protect them from trial?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver could ride for six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he would not feed on it.
You've talked about a ten-point trick that fraud taxi drivers are moving in front of foreign clients.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they concerned about this cup after the release of your reports continue to use?
I think we have popularized this trick by sending out the show.
Recently, I was driving with one taxi driver, boasting before me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that from the side of the taximeter glued black cardboard.
When I asked him what he had there, he said to me, “You know what it is.”
If the taxi drivers didn't work too much, can the court with their colleagues impress them?
Is there anything that can discourage fraud?
You said they'd always find a way to cheat.
I think that discouraging them can't do anything.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight more to get them out of there seriously.
Fortunately, I have to say from my experience that the fair taxi drivers in Prague are predominant.
But are they willing to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack an art.
He can’t walk much and can’t say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (due to the proposal for a comprehensive restriction from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová) it did not sound very clear what they wanted.
They once said they were not protesting against Uber that they just wanted to have the same terms as that of the service, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they were just blocking Prague and it was only the best possible advertising for Uber.
How do you evaluate the Prague Magistrate’s approach to solving the problem of overcoming the fare?
It is seen that she had to enter into this until the criminal police were able to solve something.
The Magistrate was short for that.
They had a mole out there that had information, that is, the taxi department did its job for several years completely useless.
I hope they'll charge the official with all the lost controls they've been last checked to realize what he's done.
That's the worst thing I can do.
I've even been with him on one control drive, which I've found only after from their schedule.
It has been several months since the series was released.
What's the response?
I think mainly of foreign viewers, on whom the series is actually the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I let those videos go.
And then when we go to the Old Town Square, there are surprises that the same people that are seen in the pictures are really standing there.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd build a fence around them to make people look at them.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Are you driving a taxi when you need it?
Yeah.
I'm driving with services I don't have to pay in cash, but with a card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatches that are fair.
I've only taken a taxi on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting into the car, “Well, you have the courage.”
Bem dressed as an Italian tourist.
The taxi drivers’ fraudulent practices were already mentioned in 2005.
Former mayor Pavel Bem set off for a check-in in the same year as an Italian tourist, and immediately, at the first attempt, he was deceived by two hundred.
But the editor Rubes had worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him CZK 820 for a ride from Staromestský to Wenceslas Square, which is about CZK 195 per kilometer, as calculated by the reportage creators.
The Prague Magistrate set a maximum price of CZK 28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising amounts in the filmed reports: for example, a two-kilometre journey from the street Parisská to Truhlárká cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For a ride to the Angel, which is 2.5 km away, six hundred crowns are charged.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
The dirt from it goes well, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be plucked out of the folds.
It’s not easy and it can’t be done quickly, the restorator Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov in Hájich brought her work closer to her.
Hat down in front of her: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb out countless times and climb again.
“Restaurant should be careful, patient and unpretentious to the working environment,” she said.
It's not the first restaurant job in Frydlantia.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back tract of the Frydlant Town Hall were restored, and the statues of St. Mary Magdalena in Zátiš, St. John of Nepomucky in Frýdlanta, Piet in Frýdlantská Kruzní street, Marian Column in Frýdlant or the Atlantic in the front of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrkem were restored.
With the restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Christopher and Catherine of Redern, Frydlant began in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the application of dirt and rust, the loosed stone parts will be secured against fall and shift; either they will anchor into the wall or towards each other.
There is also treatment and preservation of the surface.
They're on the tomb. They're gonna be golded again.
“It will then begin by gilding inscriptions on marble plates with pure slice gold,” said a referee of the State Memorial Care Office in Frýdlanta Věra Sobotová.
There are no records from the past that the tombstone would have gone through some repairs.
At a closer glance, the holes, drilled in marble columns, will be taken.
They are hundreds of years old and they are remains after the decoration of the tombstone.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately after the Swedish invasion of the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
They literally brushed the tomb, said Sobot.
In the Church of Finding the Holy Cross there are restaurants with a slight exaggeration as at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombstones that were under water, the baptismal, wall paintings in the tomb and now the tombstone were restored.
“We would also like to go to the glass in the future,” Sobot said.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, we deposit money every year in maintenance and repair.
Restorative work on the restoration of the Redernov tombstone will come to a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They will be paid from subsidies, the city will not deposit any of its money into this part of the restoration.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from winning in the 2015 regional round of the Historical City competition, the remaining 28,000 crowns is then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said the mayor of Frydlant Dan Ramzer.
A representative decided to release the winnings for the restoration of the tombstone.
Experts’ views on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indexes and comparisons with the Czech Capital Market (PX) in a one-month and a half-year horizon.
Low volatility and growth prevails in the markets.
Who would have said that earlier this year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which went through 12% of the corrections in February, is now at a new historic peak and has already credited 7% since the beginning of the year.
Once again, the iron rule is confirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which ultimately have always achieved their own.
In a situation where U.S. stocks are at a historic peak, volatility, which is currently the lowest since 2014, has grown rapidly and without fear thanks to the quantitative release of the U.S. Central Bank and when, like today, the Volatility Index (VIX) has remained stable below the 12% threshold.
And not so.
Although the Fed continues to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative releases in both Europe and Japan are in full swing, and last week, the Bank of England, which will buy £70 billion of bonds in the next six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative release pushes low returns even below and contributes to almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
This is a question for a million, of course.
But there are no risks at the moment, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and in China it is stabilizing and Brexit is no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if US stocks continue to endure in a similarly peaceful regime.
It's a shame Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very happy that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted this difficult work of an experienced politician, said European Commission chief Juncker, when a French politician (truly experienced, because of the many different transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to look for) appointed the European Commission’s main negotiator for the conditions of leaving the EU.
Juncker's choice has been a sign of hope that he is in the serious interest of the EU to seek with Britain a form of future friendly coexistence.
However, most British media have adopted the name of Barnier as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a European federalist.
The UK hates.
As Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
He took it as only he could take it: the hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
He co-authored the concept of a banking union and, with a commitment to everything coming from the London City Financial Center, passed legislation overly hard regulation of the financial sector and services.
Thus, this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a tough, unwavering, and perhaps a careless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how not to remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance sheet, overview and capacity of the empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
Even today, Czechs and Slovaks can be closest friends and allies.
It's a pity that Juncker, by Václav Klaus - at least in this - didn't teach.
It would be good for everyone!
Earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin's ruler has released his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from office on Friday.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno.
This was reported by the Russian media, citing the Kremlin press service.
Putin said he would release Ivan at his own request.
At a meeting that was broadcast by the television station Rossija 24, the president said he was coming to meet Ivan's wish when he joined the office, that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the president’s administration, now led by Ivanov’s representative, Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is considered one of Putin’s closest co-workers.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, held the post of Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now leave the chair of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov, in his meeting with Putin, said that he was the length of his stay at the head of the administration of the head of state, actually a record-breaking man.
It lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that within 25 years of its establishment, 11 people had already been replaced in this capacity.
She and Uncle will not play the finals.
So far, not one of Friday’s tennis matches has been able to turn into a final match.
Petra Kvitová was the first to lose her battle, which was subject to the Puerto Rico surprise of Monica Puig after the 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6 sets.
After a while, Czech debutists Šafarivá with Uncle also followed the flower.
In the first set, however, two sets were wasted, and the Russians eventually took the set in a shortened game.
The second set was lost by a ratio of 4:6.
Half the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skier Ondrej Synek won his semi-final with an overview when the second Damir Martin from Croatia defeated despite the release in almost a second.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said the son.
Unlike him, his opponents had to fight for progress.
So they've got some power, it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing my cards,\" said Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not walk in Snyk’s footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower took fourth place in today’s semi-finals, and on Saturday she will start in the B final and fight for the 7th to 12th place.
Gold from London won’t defend it.
I didn’t go to the finals at the Olympics for the first time.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I was running a high-quality race and putting everything I could into it.
The rivals were better, Topinková Knapková leaned in front of them.
She fought until the end and believed that she would get to the elite six in her fourth games.
He gave up the fight just before the goal.
I knew that the girls were leveled, that anyone could move out of that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could go to the finals through the Austrians.
Unfortunately, today was a life race, she told the world champion in 2011.
Far behind the final gates in Rio, the young shooter Filip Nepejchal remained, who for the second time failed to escape from the qualification, this time the small-scale in the lie.
In it, Nepeichal took 33rd place.
The qualification was best for the Russians.
From the first place, Sergey Kamenskii advanced with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nepeichal's shot was 620.5 points.
For the first time in Rio, athletes, among them Czech seven-fighter Katerina Bachová and Eliška Klekinová, spoke for the first time.
After the second discipline of the Olympic competition, the Czech record holder Eliška Klevinová is the twenty-twoth.
The British woman Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 189 centimeters as well as the second Belgian woman Nafissata Thiam.
Both took care of the historically best altitude performance within the seven-bay.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we take away from the absurdity of these questions: German society has gone through deep self-reflection, but not Russian.
In both major Eurasian nations, dictators occurred in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed largely to the 94 million victims of Communism, mentioned by the Black Paper of Communism, whether it was a daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetence of war, or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanely destroyed about 6 million Jews, and the total victim of World War II is estimated to be 60 million.
The Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities in occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany and the USSR, there were not only a few individuals, but a large part of the nation took part in these crimes, whether actively, passively or simply cowardly, or by pushing its head into the sand.
This is not just the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, immediately the end of the war came denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask, ‘Daddy, grandfather, why did you participate in such atrocities?’
How could you!
This has brought true reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned about the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naïve idealistic) goals, but it’s definitely not about attaching it back to Alsace-Lotrinsko or someone - to revanš - to attack militarily - it’s probably everyone will recognize it.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was finally closed at the turn of the millennium, when a former KGB officer (sic!)Vladimír Putin came to power.
Often, the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putinovsk Russia is the revansion, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of our own people is not a value to the fair.
Fight yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - predestined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from the growth of tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in Crimea has deteriorated.
Who does the tension increase?
After a long time of relative peace, relations between Ukraine and Russia again deteriorated.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side was the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from both sides of the enemy contradict and it is difficult to independently verify them, and so we have the opportunity to only think about the old known question, who does this benefit?
According to reports from Moscow, terrorist attacks on Crimea occurred on the Ukrainian side, which, of course, rejects Ukraine and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of Ukrainian special forces in Russia has already come from the case of pilot Savchenko, a well-known response that they were allegedly kidnapped in the territory of Russia.
If we approach the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly from the West, in the form of further strengthening sanctions and strengthening anti-Russian campaigns.
In the last year, there has been a backdrop of the immigration crisis in Europe to give away attention from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost credit to its residents when President Poroshenko’s current support is around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would have long gone bankrupt without being generous financial injections by the EU and mainly by the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention back to its country to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation before voters in their country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces again want to show up as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to Russia.
All those who are trying to wage an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually become aware of their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both sides and will stop their hostilities in a timely manner.
Bulgaria has reported inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, in Bulgaria, the monthly inflation rate was 1% in July.
This is the highest value in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 versus July 2015 was -0.2 %.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the journeys of these consumer goods groups in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and normal maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained.
The U.S. intelligence services have been tracking Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about Russian attacks came to public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the party's democratic headquarters.
However, no official report mentions Russian involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied the attack.
The report of the alleged Russian attack was strictly secret, as it would reveal that U.S. intelligence services are monitoring and revealing the way they do it and what sources they use it.
Two Russian intelligence services were involved in the attack.
New Cybersecurity Advisory Board
The Russian trace tracking material was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called the US gang, were informed of the public officials.
It is formed by the heads of the two chambers of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the chairman of the Democrats in both chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of the Congress’s defense and security committees.
Prime Minister Donna Brazil announced Thursday that she was creating a cybersecurity advisory board to “prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of the Democratic Party’s servers.”
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of the consumer’s initiative for health problems after consumption of food, Losos wild smoked - pieces of 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016 carried out a check in the stores Albert at Wenceslas Square and Na Mostek.
The inspection found that the lot L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer pointed out, was no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch was removed with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
The laboratory test confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of the sea mammals.
It is dangerous for a person - the larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen, and man-made living larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Šticha.
We apologize to customers for the problems of this branded product.
We immediately withdrawn the lot from the sale and for preventive reasons we also downloaded all other batches of this item.
There was a mistake on the part of the supplier we were dealing with, and at the same time we let this product be tested, said New York spokesman Alberta Barbora Vanko.
If a customer buys this product, they can return it in any of the chain stores and get it back.
Larvy destroys frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Vrnyka.
The health care professionals informed the Prague and Central Bohemian veterinary authorities about the occurrence of the dangerous product.
According to the server safetyfood.cz, people after seeing the parasite may get sick with anisakiosis, which manifests itself in severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease may go unsympathetic, the Czech Republic said.
Symptoms occur an hour to two weeks after consumption of insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, larva usually spontaneously leaves the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, which is why they are killed either during sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or during freezing.
The veterinarians have also examined salmon at the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three out of five samples tested had parasites in them.
The shipment of 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Expedited, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, was to date 919 packs.
At present, there is a withdrawal of unsold supplies of the product from the stores, said ČTK spokesperson Petr Pejchal on Friday.
The veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples prohibited the sending of other products from the warehouse.
Seventeen-year-old British woman wanted to flee from Austria, apparently killed by a Russian raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and quick marriage to a jihadist who was killed soon, there came a trim.
The expected paradise of the caliphate turned into hell on earth for British girls, from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She called Britain repeatedly and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They're ordered to shoot without thinking, according to The Telegraph's lawyer, the family of the deceased girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last clues led to Cancer, the last time the girl called.
Then there was only a report of her death, but it could not be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Austria and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped they would meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape because the house she stayed in compared to the country in May, ITV News said.
She added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that attacked the IS Bastion in Syria.
You would bear blue from heaven just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week when Kadiza thought of fleeing from the Islamic State, one Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to the information available, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think she interpreted it as a warning and decided not to risk, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and his 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas set off on their journey on February 17.
At home, they just said they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from it via Turkey in the territory controlled by IS.
The girl’s family, according to a lawyer, did everything in her power to get Kadiz back.
You would bear the blue out of heaven only to get your child out of a dangerous area and this family did everything she could, tensioning all the power to get her daughter home.
But it wasn’t possible without risking being caught, the lawyer added.
The only positive is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrence for other girls or even boys who let themselves be deceived by Islamist propaganda.
“There are many cases where people went there, they realized how things are going, they understood how much different this is from the promises of the Islamic State propaganda, and they wanted to return,” Akuniee said.
The fate of Kadisi's classmates is unknown.
But since they were also silent, their families must be reconciled with the fact that they are most likely dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland it is possible to go beyond bars without committing a crime.
For many centuries the village of Inveraray was the county centre and the seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts and basements under the hall have been held as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners lived were deplorable and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them and successfully.
This is why the city’s representatives decided to move the prison to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, had heating and gas lighting.
However, it was not operational for a long time, its closure was due to economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, since the smaller corrective equipment was expensive to operate and did not pay much.
Penalty stories and ghost hunts.
For the public, the prison opened a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see how different conditions were in them.
Guides in time costumes also enhance the authentic experience.
To see is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishments were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can get locked up in one of the customs, mostly due to a photograph in memory, or to create a feeling behind the bars experiencing prisoners.
In addition, the Inveraray prison is one of Scotland’s most famous locations, where it is reportedly frightening.
Several groups of hunters of paranormal activities have gone there, and to this day, the museum allows people to come up with ghosts to hunt.
Such a night will be 300 pounds, which is about 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
\"Anime - the effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animation, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with the identity of ways that border absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, a dog, or a figure that appears to be coming out of Roy Lichtenstein's picture.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any mistake will be published immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past earned criticism with allegations that the app promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin shades as an ideal of beauty.
So this week, when users offered a filter that gave them obscene eyes, curved teeth, and inflated faces, some critics called it racist Asian cartoons, “yellowface.”
And they asked if these repeated questions did not point to a larger problem of society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and news and indignation quickly spread, and Snapchat immediately said the next day that the function was cancelled.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a manifestation of accounts to the characters of the animates, not as a cartoon of the Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded painful stereotypes in action.
Others without packaging compared to the animals refused.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose photo tweet was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was \"at least harmful and embarrassing.\"
She added that “it is difficult to argue against comparisons of obvious Asian cartoons and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is drawn to a contemptous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has exceeded these cultural limits.
The American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from meeting halls in corporations to Holywood and devices that we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user,” said Katie Zhu, 25, in an interview Thursday, “it’s very difficult to do these things today without notice as it was before.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and asked others to do the same.
In an article for the Medium and in an interview on the phone, she said she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment.
Katie Zhu has criticized the company’s vast white, entirely male leadership, and the article ended with a hash tag: #Snapchat.
“It’s either that they don’t have any diversity between employees and colored people at the moment these things are decided,” Zhu said, “or do colorful people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk,” she said.
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The Company does not publish numbers relating to the diversity of its employees, with the fact that it has the status of a private company.
Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of its employees on Thursday, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently adopted a recruiter who should focus on the under-represented population and internal management of inclusion.
Zhu adds: “I’m curious if they really need other users who can say that it’s not okay, with their account being cancelled.
Military officers have distorted intelligence about IS, the parliamentary committee says
In a report issued Thursday, the Parliamentary Committee said the U.S. Central Command officers were changing intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events they provided from the country.
According to a preliminary report from the Working Group, drawn up by the Republican President of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense, “extensive dissatisfaction” has been identified among the central intelligence analysts, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of the US effort to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is an Army Central in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In a press release, the report states: “Intelligences of intelligence intelligence services approved by Centcom’s superior officers usually offered a more positive picture of US counter-terrorist efforts than confirmed by the facts on earth, and were more consistently positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.
\"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our warriors are damaged when the superior policy makers are presented with an incorrect analysis,\" said Ken Calvert, a congressman and a Republican from California.
The failure in the management of Centcom goes to the top of the organization.
The Decade Report describes the continuing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing American efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no decisive evidence that Obama administration leaders ordered the reports to be changed, it is reported that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the danger posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many press reports from the Central Staff, statements and statements from the Congress were significantly more positive than what events actually were,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“This is clear after months of investigation,” said Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican Party in Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. Central Staff intelligence personnel were manipulating the highest rankings with staff intelligence output in order to minimize the dangers of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans compiled a working group after they learned about the concerns of analysts about the fact that intelligence information regarding the Islamic State is being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday must be followed by a more detailed investigation.
Further investigations conducted by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence are being conducted in Centcom’s intelligence services.
The Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some conclusions of the working group of Republicans.
“In the years 2014 and 2015 Centcom created a very narrow process for drawing up an assessment of information on IS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the Committee and representative of Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, the process “has led to the twisting of intelligence outlets,” it has damaged the morality between analysts and “inadequate consideration of dissenting opinions.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House would try to push Centcom analysts to modify their conclusions according to “a template or a political situation”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the ongoing investigation of the Pentagon Inspector General, which was initiated following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report, as the investigation by the General Inspector continues.
However, he said that “experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security.”
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether Americans are being bombarded in Iraq and Syria successfully (a statement that is now declaring a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year’s allegations have raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the fact that the Central Staff sincerely evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of the Islamic State report reflects the conflicts for more than ten years, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the administration of President George W. Bush, despite the objections of many analysts, defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resistance to Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that despite public statements of the opposite, air strikes against Islamic State refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's financial resources because the group built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not passed outside of the Central Staff.
Centcom’s commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticised last year after many legislators found the Senate’s testimony to a very positive assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
The US won ground hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today it will play a decisive match in the UK team.
Katie Bam in the match against Japan, who ended up winning 6:1, shot three goals and only a day later for the American women's ground hockey team shot the first two goals of the match, in which on Thursday America defeated India 3:0.
Five goals in two matches are a success worth remembering, but Bam (27) said she wasn’t sure if she ever managed to do something like that.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I’m not one of those who write down their goals.
This is what he knows: Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to 4:0 matches and share the first place in the UK group, which remained unbeatable on Thursday after Japan’s 2:0 defeat.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide which of the six teams will end up in the first and second place.
The team in the first place will avoid strong Danes, who are at the forefront of the second group.
Whatever Saturday's game ends, the Americans, with their surprising ride, sparked a stir four years after the end of the 12 teams in the games in London.
Bam was on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took the ice hockey hockey for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
In 2008, the Olympics escaped because they didn’t get into the final lineup.
Then came 2012 when she didn’t succeed much, or members of her team.
The following year, he was appointed an English coach by Craig Parnham and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the pace of work we have in London today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bamová started in the first half by shooting the goal with a beekend from the nearby area.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly hard and maintained a score of 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then clicked into the middle and shot the ball into the goal to get the Americans to lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The blackout of American goalkeeper Jackie Brigs, who helped one goal in each of the three wins, was the first in the tournament at all.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
“We’re in a good place now,” Parnham said, but as good as it is, it will depend on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympics
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro it is felt a persistent, indescribable and biased alternation of competition and effort.
It’s like an Olympic torch itself is a hot relay pin that’s passed on to swimmers, gymnasts, and a triathlonist.
You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee bar front without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then he's Logan Dooley, too.
Dooley, the upcoming female lover with lows in his face, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names sound in the home at the main broadcasting time between advertising and sponsor spots if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a sword.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California is fighting for Olympic gold in jumps on the trampoline.
The Olympic fire does not shine on all competitions as well.
Far from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not widely recognized: shooting from air guns, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and will probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the inconspicuous magic of the trampoline.
Although the jumps on the Olympics have been the Olympics since the 2000s, when they were first featured at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost unnoticed - many people I asked, didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It may be regional indifference.
The U.S. never won a medal in the jumps on the trampoline and until 2012 none of the athletes reached the final.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be embraced by Dong Dong from China and Russia MacLennan from Canada.
However, the jumps on the trampoline have yet another bad luck, partly because the ear of the unconsecrated will seem to be more suited to the clown university than to the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has a comic potential - comics vibration of endless reflection - but also the brilliance of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it combines.
The word “trampoline” is derived from the Spanish “el trampoline”, which means “jumping board”
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to almost 10 meters high and exhibits teams with several elements (salta, screws and combinations) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympics program, they are evaluated according to the implementation, difficulty and \"times in the air\"
Twenty-three athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectories of the Olympics are ahead.
Fighters for a gold medal must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, somewhere there and back, up and down.
He is trying to catch up not only on the target tape or starting wall, but as the TV news reports, another imaginary line: the world record or the Olympic record.
This unanimity effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and sufficient to bring spectators to tears.
But I think it’s also a bit exhausting when you’re watching the Olympics.
The jumps on the trampoline in this regard bring relief.
The athlete's track on the trampoline is upwards.
The purpose is not to move forward.
He or she reflects, as if they were in a state of no weight, like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and of course, there is no difficulty, but for the duration of the assembly there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no measurement of the distance, but only the perfect, fine suspension of time and gravity.
This is the nearest time for the Olympics and Zen to come.
The qualification and finale of women takes place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock Eastern time, the male competition then on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will broadcast the final within the afternoon block, which starts for both days at 14 o'clock.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise a quiet, pleasant moment that you will probably overlook through the other battles.
And if the attention is only to be achieved by male athletes being the subject of in love and materialization - as the US gymnasts recently proposed by Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch their breath.
\"Protesters of the generation - in Ethiopia, long-term allies of the United States
Violence protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have encountered violent resistance by the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot during the clashes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been engulfed by anti-government riots that are spreading into more and more areas.
Over the past week, thousands of people have gone to the streets demanding major political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses say the police were shot and killed by crowds of unarmed demonstrators.
On the rolling video recordings from protests that probably come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, members of the security forces are captured, as young people are hammered with holes after being forced to stand by the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now demanding a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and take a step forward will be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to eliminate the danger of a terrorist attack in the area, particularly in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has significantly improved - in the capital Addis Ababa there is even a new suburban train.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - organizations fighting for human rights without ceasing talk about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled, imprisoned, killed or expelled far into the desert.
But that can change.
“When you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break,” said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He is protesting all youth.
He's been protesting for generations.
There are many complaints about everything from land disputes to absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year’s elections, which were widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies won the last chair held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, there is increasing pressure at the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this inexactly marked, controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past few years, such as the Orom Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to exploit and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now after years of squeezing under the surface, these bitter sensations have rekindled.
The first is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks for the last few years, when they have become commonly available for cheaper smartphones and have improved the provision of internet services.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly the case especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxy to hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians talked about how they gathered for protests.
There is also greater solidarity between Oroma and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
For many centuries, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian mountains of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade and used Oromas, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
“We are on our way to a united leadership,” said Mulata Gemech, leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests took place in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is illegally dominated by members of the Tigrai ethnicity, which make up about 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 when he fell ill.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly masterfully able to reveal the initial signals of dissatisfaction and used the envoys to process and win the opponents to his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigrai region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say they have no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many are afraid that the result will be another shedding of blood.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest in 2005, thousands of people protested what analysts called elections that the government had cowarded and then stolen.
There followed a severe intervention during which many protesters were killed - even though less than in the past months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have appreciated Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
It is clear, however, that the gradual rise in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop this.
There is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the town of Gondar attacked trade firms owned by the Tigers, and the envy against the Tigers on social networks is becoming more common.
Analysts say protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in an unpleasant situation.
The U.S. government uses Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently declared that the base was closed.
While the West wants to clearly support democracy, it does not want its ally to fall apart in such an unsustainable area.
“That,” Abdi said, “is a very sharp edge of the blade.”
Donald Trump explains his statement on Obama and IS funding as “sarcast”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to downplay the latest controversy that floods his campaign by declaring that he didn’t mean it seriously when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were “founders” of Islamic State terrorist groups.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of a Republican candidate to speak clearly with the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an uncomfortable situation, who strongly defended him during a stormy time, and must explain that he may not have taken his notes seriously.
Following this proposal at a meeting Wednesday night, Trump confirmed on Thursday and insisted in the talks that he did not really intend to say that President and H. Clinton IS had created.
But in a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the claim of the old one just one day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When the conservative radio moderator Hugh Deere tried to help Trump's comment ease the reminder that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes when Trump attempted to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in election polls fall.
Trump and Clinton took part this week in Michigan duel on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this topic.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, and said her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm defense earlier.
At the end of July, when he collected a wave of criticism when he made a suggestion that the Russians should penetrate Clinton’s emails, his remark later explained: “I’m, of course, sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and to moderate them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing, to what extent some reports have a response from his supporters, to find out how they react, and then, according to a response, “he gave an explanation,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language both candidates used.
But I also think he is agile in his statements, and he knows that they are vague enough to be explained differently.
As the results of the election polls continue to decline, Trump has chosen an even more fiddling tone over the last few days, rather than making things moderate for the general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Tump is with a great distance from Clinton, North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and very close to Florida.
Trump is trying to avoid excuses for the provocative statements he says, but he often blames his criticisms for misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But along with Trump’s growing attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, they put Trump’s jokes in the uncomfortable situation of his devoted supporter, who must stand by him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate on Thursday in an interview with CNN.
“I believe that what he says is a legitimate political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true, in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization which he called a novice, and it happened because he pulled his troops out of Iraq.
Most of the ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, in which Clinton acted as Foreign Minister, allowed IS to smother and fail to handle the situation aggressively in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s gatherings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to hit fire around him on Twitter for changing every word and being interested in him.
He laughed at “the poor, the pathetic, the television scholars who try to understand him, and said, “They can’t do it.”
A few Democrats have apologized to Trump for being another proof that he is not eligible for the presidential office.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the price market. It is now back in Greenpoint
The Cafe Cafe was a stunned place in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee was served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that was replaced in summer 2014 - sells cake-shaped soaps.
The locals were crying as the last loss of the growing city.
“New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is wasted, and the Pedal is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, then it's also rediscovery.
The Risen Verb Cafe opened in November at Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original site.
The new Pedal has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The manager of the new Verba is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
He started at Bomber in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his customers offered to pay for a move to a new place, he said he would do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Pedals still have the same supplier of pastries and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even used lighting from the old Verba.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new too.
He started using new ingredients.
The hotel offers ham, eggs and cheese and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You will also find bowls with brown rice.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady tide of the original stamgass.
“A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices,” he said.
Last Sunday there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliver.
Mrs. Oliver (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe often.
It even happened when the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Pedal closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verba,” she said.
Now he's drinking coffee again, but on that day, instead of his usual iced coffee, she gave herself a mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been in Verbu since 2003.
He goes to work and always orders the same thing.
“In a quarter and eight here every day, like a watch, I will come and prepare my violin with everything and butter,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he lets himself have bacon, eggs and ham on his bread.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, Soap Cherie's owners offered him a special soap and used filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
“I think we could still use it,” Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of the Greenpoint cafe also accepted well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon expose her to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
A local producer of fruit juice wants to roll into bottles and sell filtered coffee.
It offers the possibility to expand the café into a neighboring building.
Many customers just need to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop opened again, it was like coming home.
“I missed the smell,” he said.
Depressive food from the times of crisis - in \"Square Meal\"
Shortly after joining the office of the president in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
The swan president Roosevelt enjoyed the selected dishes of the 5th Avenue, such as a piste from the cavities of the javelins and a Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for this day was more modest: an egg for the devil’s way in a paradise sauce, potato puree and as a dessert plum poodle.
“It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat.”
The couple who lives in Brooklyn Heights is engaged in gastronomy history.
Andrew Coe’s latest book, “Chop Suey,” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book, “97 Orchard,” tells the life story of a living house on Lower East Side through food.
Their new collaborative work, “A Square Meal, which Harper will publish on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during a major economic crisis.
They showed themselves a cooking solidarity, and they met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small, greasy buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) gave himself turkey, potato porridge and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbane, which, according to the couple, was excellently suited to talk about food during the crisis.
“Carbanettes were very popular,” said Ms. Ziegelman.
It was sold berry, liver and bean carbane.
They were made from that mixture and other cheap foods that the ingredients set up.
Imagine the number of beers you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe got stuck.
“They would lie in your stomach like lead,” he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of snow, what you eat.
The women’s teams cooked for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch and dinner was served freshly baked cake.
They were Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. “A Square Meal,” watching how the nation was coping with the fact that it was not a land of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write it.
A new budget diet was equally feared: mysterious foods such as carbs and chestnut foods, castrels as “an amazing way to use the remains,” Ziegelman said, as chefs could hide unaesthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the central point of American food - has become a cost-effectively allocated luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were to serve as a caloric and nutritious filling, were preferred to taste or even common sense when cooking.
During surveys for a book containing recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a period meal of baked onions filled with beet butter.
“It wasn’t a favorite addition to the evening table,” said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman said: “It was surrealistic.
The beet butter with baked onions does not come together.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
Like never before, and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the head of the federal government for the domestic economy from 1923 to 1943 - managed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, calling on women to take charge of the budget, and tendons such as creamy spiders with carrots turned into delicious foods.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical delicacies.
First of all, the desserts were created in the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as the pose of President Herbert Hoover \"I will have a cake -
While he publicly praised the simple Iowan farming cuisine of his childhood, he ate as a select millionaire to whom he became.
“I like to eat continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce,” said Andrew Coe.
He ate in a nearly gilded room, he was wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably make the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, did not force him to follow the example of his own stomach.
As the book tells us, Mrs Roosevelt hired a puberty who was not interested in taste at all. This led to the fact that the White House “not only was served with almost the most poignant meal in Washington, but also in the most comforted manner prepared”
A number of dietary habits from the time of the crisis came to light as the country stood on its feet again.
The link remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple says that during the writing of the book they better understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother - for example, why she couldn't kill the food.
“She had a real fear of wasting food,” said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman said, “It was wrong for people to do it.”
There was an accident with the wreaths.
When the tables were clean at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
\"He's called plum cream,\" said Ziegelman, adding that the usual trick was to give elegant names to modest recipes.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly broke a spoon into thick brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as the right host, he said to his wife, “It would be good to have a little bit of chopped hair.”
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees who are going to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what the series would look like if they were filmed by us.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us makes fun of their native country.
Using a photoshop, he creates collages that funnyly show what it would look like if the famous series and films were filmed in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of legal representation costs in case of patent against jaundice type C against Merck
The judge of the District Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to pay the fees for lawyers incurred in the process concerning the patent against jaundice type C against the drug manufacturers of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, a judgment was lifted that Gilead was supposed to pay 200 million for damages due to a breach of Merck’s two patents in connection with the highly successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge repeatedly found illegal acts on the part of Merck, among other things, lies under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to the release of charges incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the new-generation drug market against jaundice type C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active ingredient in the medicines from Gilead.
US-backed military forces claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
U.S.-backed troops gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sifting the city after the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city.
The troops have liberated over 2,000 civilians who have been detained by the radicals, said SDF and the Manbij military council to Reuters Sharfan Darwish.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching for it,” he told Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2%.
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return, stating that a presidential candidate for Democrats and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue in a given year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton contributed $5.3 million to joint cash for lectures, while former Foreign Minister awarded $3 million to Simon & Schuster for her book on her work at the State Department.
Clinton's Co- Candidate, US Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, have published a tax return in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3%.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to be a model of financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton campaign.
Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and retreating from his previous promises to make his tax returns public.
It is customary that candidates for the President of the United States publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose on them.
Trump, a New York merchant, and his lawyers cited the audit of the U.S. Treasury Department of Finance as a reason for his refusal to publish a tax return.
“Your move,” said Hillary Clinton’s campaign partner on Twitter, citing a tax return from a Democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s Special Advisor, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to make a tax return public until audits have been completed.
According to Trump’s critics, among whom the Republican candidate for the president of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, trade transactions and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
On Friday, Clinton released a video reminding her of how high the Republican’s position on Trump is calling for him to make his tax returns public.
On Thursday, I will address the issue of economic issues in Michigan.
“It refuses to do what all other presidential candidates have done for decades - to publish their tax returns,” she said.
Politico said Trump had paid no or very low taxes in the last two years, and New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants claiming it could be the case right now.
The federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton enforces a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett to ensure that all who earn more than $1 million a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at the Clinton Assembly in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, Trump called for a meeting and exchange of tax returns.
Buffett said he also underwent an IRS audit and that Trump was \"not afraid - the financial office, but voters.
Clinton's campaign published a tax return until 2007.
Clinton, now living in Chappaqua, New York, on average, paid a federal tax of 32% on average between 2007 and 2014 and a combined tax of approximately 40.5%.
According to Clinton’s 2015 tax return, unlike most Americans, it only makes $100 in their incomes.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton reported revenue on dividends and interest rates of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use a non-orthodox way to prevent elephants from going to human dwellings - they throw condoms filled with chilli powder on them.
This practice has proven itself and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea several years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, as using this nonviolent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them used a copy of their defenses.
Friday is a world day of elephants dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since the development of this ... set of tools, we have seen a change in behavior in these communities. People have much more faith that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell in a statement.
The first and second step is to illuminate the passing elephant with a battery and run the horn.
If it doesn’t discourage her, the so-called “chill bulge” will be thrown away.
Chilli powder mixed with salt, together with petard, wraps into condoms, its end is congested so that only wicks can look from it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a fine powder from the chilli is scattered into the air.
Most of the time, one veil is enough, and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to fire the fireworks, which will trigger a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director leans into Berlin’s hotel for removing code for calling to Israel at “Arab Request” - RT News
French film director of Jewish origin sparked a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have the code for calling to Israel, according to the employee’s words, on the basis of “the requirement of Arab clients.”
Claude Lanzmann, author of a documentary on the Holocaust, \"Shoah - ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of codes for hotel calls.
However, the state has not been mentioned among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol offers a call to Israel via its own call centre.
The director sought an explanation and turned to the hotel reception with a problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, said, “shocked.”
The hotel’s staff said that the measures were “decided after the management of Kempinski Hotels”
The director’s reason for this was even more encouraging.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they have demanded that the call code of Israel be deleted,” Lanzmann said in a letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case “a great shame”
We were horrified and shocked by the events.
In itself, it is a great shame.
The fact that such a thing happened in Germany and in addition in such a hotel chain is an even greater shame.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” he said.
The event sparked a strong online response, and people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel simply “lost” in the demand of Arab customers.
“The shame,” another post says, pointing out that the hotel, located in Kurfurstendamm Nobles Street, is near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel newspaper, the hotel itself quickly made any accusations by calling the event a \"view - and Lanzman \"sorry -\"
“There has never been a direct order to not include Israel in the call code list,” said Hotel Kempinski’s representative Suddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber projectiles against Brazilian students
The student and police conflict occurred in San Paul, Brazil, on Thursday, when students gathered to a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesters.
The problem escalated when government order services tried to get the students out, which ended with the police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the Governor of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin to save money is the closure of almost hundreds of public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were able to see signs spraying on the wall against temporary President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators set out mass in the streets to support Dilmy Rousseff's established president when the Senate in the country decided to charge her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
Russian ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan said the trade turnover in Iran increased by 70.9 percent after the sanctions were lifted between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions were lifted against Iran, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies that trade in the country.
Russian companies are restoring existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“The further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached an amount of 856 million dollars.
In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 percent to $158 million.
The growth in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,\" the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travel visas.
In addition, Iran first got among the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iran in Russia last year will be exceeded,” he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
“I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition,” he said.
“Scot Callum Skinner rushes home after the British get gold in cycling”
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in a men's team sprint on a verlodrome in Rio, when the trio of the VB team defended the title from London 2012.
The twenty-two-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the brake that Sir Chris Hoy took for his Scot, and the young man pleased the legend when he credited himself to the target and stole the victory from the hand of the favorite New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after the end of the modest sixth at the World Championship in the track cycling in March, even though Hoy in the meantime ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for the specialized introduction racer Jamie Staff.
The Indians appeared just in time.
After Hoye left, a place was also released to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was with Hoy the champion four years ago - and with Skinner they reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but the t-shirt took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio got gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind his wheel, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of strategy was a large part of the transformation, when Hindes went on a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy race watched the BBC commentator from his position, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes came out on stage, he didn't let them out of their eyes.
The 32-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: “It’s a proud comparison.
I'm here to get the best out of me and make an honor for my name.
We have set an Olympic record in the final and we have defeated the best.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had fallen on track after a weak start.
The note was later withdrawn and the rivals of Britain had no opportunity to appeal.
This time there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said, “With all the British flags on the tribunals, I felt like I was in London.
In the last three months, we've all been stuck like a team.
We have lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It’s one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is supposed to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we are waiting for a successful five days on the verlodrome.
With the form he presented, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy’s success and win three gold medals at the same time at one Olympics.
It would then be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also has his birthday on March 23 (this date seems sacred for British sports, on this day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
As much as Hoy got.
As another, Kenny will take part in a sprint that starts today and lasts three more days.
An eight-year-old native from Bolton said, “I’m enjoying this one now.
The team race is always the best.
You win with others.
To tell the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “When he wins another two gold medals, he should be given a knight’s title.
It was the only medal race of the day, but Britain was expecting more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest fighter team for four kilometers.
Ended with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (22:42) are held today at the second day of the race, which will definitely be focused on Wiggins.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he discussed with the Commissioner when the referees called on him to measure the height.
In a similar race of women that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached a world record with a time of 4:13,260.
The VB team was relying on their strong team of track cycling and mastered the middle season of the Olympics and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, showing absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations fell during the preparation for Rio.
In the background, there have been dramatic events, and last but not least, the resignation of the technical director, Shan Sutton, in April, due to allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of a career of great people, such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of races on the verlodrome, the legendary reputation seems to be that the UK team is able to produce superior performance with perfect timing, it could be reconfirmed.
Insecure future of Portland smelter after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of Portland smelting in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that the company supplies with electricity and which informed about the intention of one of the owners of the smelting agreement on electricity supplies. All contracts for electricity supply are expected to be shortened.
This step takes place after the government of Victoria earlier this year has decided not to extend the granting of subsidies that keep the company running.
A fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
There may be up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk when closing.
And since the tap consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be other Lavinous impacts.
Alcoa closed Point Henry in 2014, which last year led to the closure of the Anglesea plant.
Alcoa’s watermelon in Portland is profitable and threatened to close.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, originally in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for production of the plant.
AGL, which supplies electricity from Loy Yang A in Latrobe Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The company is owned by Alcoa and Aluminum, with small shares held by Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the tap will continue,” she said.
The AGL stated that the contracts were so-called “restriction contracts”, which were due to enter into force from November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month notice period, so their validity will actually end in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that contracts will contribute to profit for the fiscal year 2017,” the plant said.
Any possible impact on AGL profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said it had already written down the value of contracts under its $187 million book book \"in case the termination occurs -
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contract had “no impact on its ... ability to operate a melthouse or to secure the supply of electricity to a melthouse.”
The American company said it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to start in November of this year, although it still needs to explain why it had resigned from the contract.
Analysts are very careful when it comes to the possible closure of the Portland melthouse in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to a weak economy in the sector.
AGL Chief Operating Officer Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and about 900 megawatts per year.
If both companies were to withdraw from the market, this would result in a substantial reduction in market demand [electrical energy].
It wouldn’t be good for us as a producer,” he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the TV show Kardashian - now the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of a mother-man of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, appeared on the front page of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the brand’s ambassador, Estee Lauder, who performed at a fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, looking at this title page, she wants to cry,” Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the title page followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the humorist in Kardashian's submission?) staged video, in which the whole family of Kardashian-Jenner (the color breakers Rob and Caitly and along with them all the favorite uncles from the show, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). They forgot on the cover of their sisters only so that the scene could end with a classic turn: they prepare a secret party.
It’s a circling storyline of almost every “birthy” part of the children’s television show (Seacrest says: “You thought we had forgotten about you,” with the sincerity of the cartooned rabbit on the show at eight o’clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure that other girls could feed on this publicity.
Because when we look at the September Vogue magazine number, we must have entered the new Kardashian era.
Senior sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the magazine’s September issue is a different league.
The September edition of Vogue magazine is the best-selling number of the year.
The edition, which by its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that from 832 pages last year there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star that appears on the title page is unexpectedly expected, so it’s no wonder that in the past two years the magazine’s images have escaped even before its official publication.
Women who appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more “celebrity models” on the front page than “models who are celebrities.”
Jennifer Lawrence, owner of the Oscar and ambassador of the Dior brand, appeared on the title in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But even though it's very unlikely that Kendall - which the magazine describes as \"a breakthrough model - her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of familiar people, nor stars of real estate shows, or children of today who know how to make a well-preserved video (although Jenner represents all this).
They are demonstrably talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them \"the girls of the moment.\"
These feelings got worse again with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the true sense.
He's doing it for Mark Jacobs.
He sells you a make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She's selling pictures of her daughter Cindy Stanford, who she's photographed for Love magazine.
And in free moments, she works in a reality show, perhaps just as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Community Legal Aid Centers Reject 160,000 People a Year
More than 160 000 people at risk are denied legal aid centres every year in the community, and in the sector they themselves are preparing for impacts that will have further restrictions on the already over-burdened services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, threatened workers, victims of violence, and people without funds to fight unfair eviction, and so on - are denied as long as they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to crack, are preparing for further cuts.
Since June next year, these legal aid centers will lose an additional 30 percent of federal finances.
The director of Community Legal Assistance Centers in Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community Centers of Legal Assistance, 5,000 people were found to be rejected annually.
Mr Farrell said that without the federal government's decision to be lifted, the situation would deteriorate.
“The community’s legal assistance centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped from relations with the violent, people with excessive and glaring debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly released - all these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows that they do not have a chance to get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, leading to thousands of people at risk from Queensland having to be oriented into complex legal issues without assistance.
We are calling on state prosecutor and senator George Brandis to immediately prevent this shortening of finances from getting the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the last year, the government of the state has been committed to ensuring the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now it’s time to look at the needs of the community’s legal assistance centers and the community of their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign action after a staff member reportedly directed a gun
New York: A lawsuit was filed on Donald Trump's campaign for alleged inaction after they were told that the North Carolina Operations Director was targeting a gun on a crew member while driving a jeep in February.
The incident was described in the court file, which was filed by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer of the campaign in the state on Wednesday at the Charlott State Court.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before it concluded that \"it would not happen so -
Director Earl Phillip “marked the fingers of a gun, put the right pointer on the trigger and directed the head of the head to Vincent’s head,” Bordini said in a lawsuit.
The file states that Bordini found that at least four other people experienced the same with Phillip following a complaint at the local and regional management of the campaign.
“The gun may not fire to cause damage,” Bordini said in a lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate raised the upheaval when he told voters in North Carolina that the owners and gun holders could take action (which is regulated in the U.S.’s second amendment to the constitution) if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and will be able to appoint her judges.
Trump’s campaign says the media has pulled his words out of context and that Trump has not defended violence.
Bordini is seeking compensation from the campaign for careless surveillance and from Phillip for threatening personal security, illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump's spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the request for comment.
Attempts to get statements from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news branch in Charlotta, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one has responded to his or her advice to the Innovative Consulting Services in a short time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of recovery and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
Heathrow is very attractive to me, just as London 2012 was when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympics had huge benefits for Startford and the East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching sites, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to the unemployment of young people around the airport.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, there are those who will think that Heathrow expansion is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would laugh at the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out that they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave a legacy in the form of skills and employment both in the vicinity of the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who, in the deadline and with the budget, introduced a £11 billion infrastructure investment program, starting with the T5 terminal - which was chosen by the world's best terminal five years in a row, after Terminal T2, which was built between the two busiest Ranses in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third rango worth £16 billion in private investment.
Games in London in 2012 were a huge success of the UK and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will also be it.
It is time to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trading for the future and leave the legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Eighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Business Officer of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in cat and mouse game in ad blocking
Attempts to bypass ad blocking programs have become a cat and mouse game for companies that make money on online marketing. At least one of the companies that program such software claims.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site stating that users can update filters in their program and re-block advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change encoding around ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the page are advertising.
Adblock says new codes have already passed.
Adblocker Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open source ad blocking community and those trying to get around it has been since the ad blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another custom fix.
The fact that the company owning the world’s largest social network has engaged in the war shows just how big the problem of ad blocking for industry has become.
According to a study, Tkerou carried out Pagefair last year, and Adobe uses around 200 million people worldwide advertising filters - almost four times that of 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook advertising profits, with Facebook visiting 1.03 billion active users every day from mobile devices.
The spokesperson said the company is going against desktop advertising filters because mobile advertising filters for social networking and Instagram don’t work.
Desktop ads still represent a profit high enough to make Facebook decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said Tuesday it would update the ad preferences tool to give people the opportunity to better control how ads appear to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters are worrying about them, as they could also block content that is not related to the ad.
“It’s not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blocking is an insensitive tool, so we’d rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
The Swiss Motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an event in which on Thursday morning several cars were taken over by a woman who probably tried to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight in Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the actor was “a desperate act” lying in the dark on the road, and that several cars had taken it.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and hit her with several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but according to the police, they have not yet been identified. The police are calling on these drivers and everyone else who witnessed the accident to sign up.
A criminal investigation was opened, “a logical step in a situation like this one,” Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Is it possible to prevent the impact?
“This is what the prosecutor has to find,” said Hofstetter.
Based on two similar cases in the past five years, drivers do not seem to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian who passed the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspapers said.
Last year, police officers were deprived of charges of negligence after they collided and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne.
The court said the victim drank alcohol at the age of 22 and fainted on the road.
The court found that police officers - which responded to emergency calls - were in a reasonable way and that the presence of a man on the road was \"an entirely exceptional and unpredictable situation,\" the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident that occurred at Morges should register with the police on phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for LGBT communities.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to come to Prague within the Prague Pride.
On Friday, the CEO of AČCKA Katerina Petříčková announced this.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival brings the lives of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (LGBT).
About 35,000 people participated last year.
“The practice is one of the most popular destinations in the LGBT community, for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialized enterprises,” Petříčková said.
According to a survey of organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of CZK 3100 per person per day.
Gay tourists are available special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
“For tourism in general, LGBT clients are very lucrative, interested in stays in higher price sessions with a high standard of travel services and spend more than others,” Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is also held this year.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also address several thematic areas such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be on Saturday a traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
The tour, attended by thousands of people in recent years, honors the minute silence of the victims of the June attack at the Orlando Nightclub, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrate forty years.
Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have enjoyed small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series by director Lubomír Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than 100 countries of the world, were the cartoon jokes of the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who invented for the magazine with two cuts by Mr. Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Benes then invited dramatographer Jiří Kubíček and artist Vladimír Jiránek to cooperate and co-created the film Kutaci.
Today’s form with a yellow and red trick and a ball and radio was given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak TV began in the short film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then given to the Kutilians in 1985, this time they were filming directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Benedict founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, more works continued with other creators, many of whom participated in the participation of the son of Benedict.
At present, there are more than 90 episodes with the stories of these kutils, which everything supplants under their hands, but they never get angry with each other and are always filled with optimism, ideas and Kutilian enthusiasm and are finally satisfied with their work, which will prove by a familiar gesture - and that's it.
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theaters, and characters, or other toys with a picture of Pat and Mat are a hit by every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two-year harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we chose for you one sport and one of life.
They both have a good ending.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
What things do people spend the most on airports?
This is a Friday review from the world’s websites.
First medals from the Olympics.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
The Rugby selection of this archipelago was defeated by the UK's seven-knit rugby team in the final of the Olympic tournament.
It is the first medal ever won by Fiji at the Olympics.
Waiting for the profit of the first precious metal took sixty years from the first expedition to the Olympics.
A lot of success is due to coach Fiji.
Ironically, it is Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and, after the finale, as a British citizen, he could be satisfied, unlike his compatriots.
“Let’s go play freely and easily and see if we can handle the biggest match in our history,” the coach said before the final.
Fiji ultimately dominated it, and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has lived without hands for 11 months and got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
“Mommy, she’s like me,” a two-year-old girl rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her hands and legs and then sits together without prosthetics.
In less than a year of life, type B meningitis was diagnosed, and doctors gave it only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and never gives up.
He's got a point of view.
I saw her presenting herself to other children with the words Hi, I'm Harmonie and I don't have hands.
Look at the joy of the doll.
What do we spend the most at the airport for?
CNN reports that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
Hudson's travel essential store has released data for the last year, summarizing 10 products that customers buy most often in their airport stores.
The water was the first.
The drinks were generally very popular, in the first ten they were placed eight.
The ninth place occupied a large pack of M&M candy with coconut flavor.
Can you guess who is closing the top 10?
As the only one of the things mentioned above, you cannot eat.
According to CNN, it's the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win. Murray and Bond laughed.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have reigned for seven years and confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, the disparate couple moved to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics, and since 2009 the competition has been crushing.
In the lagoon, Rodriga de Freitase won the 69th win in the series in the Thursday final.
What are we different than others?
We are just nicer, joked Murray during the Olympic Regatta, when he was supposed to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
To be honest, we do nothing different than others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy,\" Murray said more seriously.
Their domination is remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-metre and hundred-kilometer chasm, and the academically-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They are also of a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, and Murray has a charity boxing match.
For this reason, they don’t spend much time together outside rowing.
Eric enters the boat basically with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, admitted Bond, who also demonstrated at the press conference that Murray was dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to answer, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, it destroys the opponent with a calm force.
They drive their paces, and although they are often not in the middle of the track yet, they have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We run on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first mile apart.
We're just trying to drive a pace that no one else can do.
We know what we have to do to win,\" Murray said.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Cup.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the gold four without a steering wheel.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics, one year later they decided to move to two without a steering wheel.
At the Olympics in London, they probably did the biggest defeat of their career and confirmed dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask for anything.
This time it was a bit more fun.
We knew it would be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally good at it, Murray said.
We all want to be thrown out of the throne.
We still have the target on our back.
But we are trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA’s climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Research have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water, and the saturated CO2, conditions similar to those on Earth could prevail.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of rotation of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus once seemed to be proud of a rare Earth-like atmosphere and turned slowly.
The model also looked at the previous topography of Venus.
On the planet, the areas were probably more dry than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the sun, which was 30 percent more subdued.
“In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during a slow rotation, he exposes his daily side to the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
This is how the surface is heated and the rain is formed, which creates a dense layer of clouds, which behave like an umbrella, and the surface is covered by excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model has compiled the story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothetized by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over the course of several billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and water vapors were burned with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped and only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly effect of greenhouse gas remained -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers have published their findings from the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Colorado Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as a coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche’s hockey operations, as a reason for the inability to participate in the decision-making process on the team’s issues.
The executive vice president/general manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the last three years, I have worked as chief coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and commitment,” Roy said in a statement.
I have been thinking for a long time and intensively over the years how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the coach and vice president of hockey operations are consistent with the vision of the organization.
It must also be able to take part in decisions affecting the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had received Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
“Patrick informed me of his decision today,” Sakic said.
We value everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
The team has earned 112 points and the first place in the Central Division, but Colorado has faced Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and has always failed to match him after the season in the last two years.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the 2015/2016 season and missed five points to win the second wild card in the Western Conference.
The goalkeeper Roy, who joined the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal, and twice with Avalanche.
North Sea oil platform workers resume talks and interrupt strike
The top officials of the negotiating parties stated that wagering for oil platform workers in the North Sea was interrupted, while all parties to the dispute had come together for a new round of negotiation.
Bets against the oilfield service company Wood Group sporadically occurred on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that they have agreed to restore the process for resolving current disagreements,” the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent event, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent in protest against wage cuts.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid its North Sea suppliers about 9% less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would provide the company with room to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has cut thousands of people out of his paychecks and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries due to the modernisation of its processes - immediately after the mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain’s June decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of the Scottish Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disagreements of the entire generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the economy in the region.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some,” he said.
For comparison, almost $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea in 2016, while the average over the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures star rotation speed in Pleiades
Kepler’s latest space telescope mission to help astronomers is to get a nearly complete list of the speeds of rotation of stars from the Pleiades cluster.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, and how the rotational time is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age and even its history in its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades cluster is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and have been formed for over 125 million years.
Now it's turning faster.
At maximum speeds of rotation, these teenage stars release a huge amount of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the star getting older, its rotational speed is slowing down.
Kepler measures each star's rotation speed by measuring the time between the discovery of recognizable points on stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, making the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
“In the ballet, Pleiades, we see that slower rotating stars are more massive, while those that spin faster are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and rotational speeds.
“The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars,” Rebull said.
There’s still a lot we want to know about how, when, and why stars slow down their speed of rotation and so saying, “it hangs its dance shoes on a nail.”
Rebull and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the speed of rotation of Pleiades in three studies, which will soon be published in the journal Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then the qualification agreement wouldn't be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it possible to work without enrolling in specialization education?
I mean, in the field I would like to work in, there is now a job available only in a slightly more distant hospital, but in about half a year I could be freeing up a place in another, where I would then like to work.
So I don’t know how to deal with the situation for about half a year, the question continues.
Replying to Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No law provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and can be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the return of costs incurred related to increasing or deepening the qualifications of the employee.
In the health field, long-term pressure is being put on not concluding these agreements with a view to ensuring the working mobility of healthcare professionals, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
Pursuant to Act No. 99/2004 Coll., the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional competence and specialized competence for the exercise of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, and expressly the participation in specialization education is considered to be deepening the qualification (not as an increase in it).
This means that a qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs are at least 75 000 CZK.
No legislation nor does it provide for the obligation to apply for specialization education.
The law only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialization education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to carry out the profession of a doctor already thanks to the completion of the necessary university study, although under the statutory conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law anticipates a situation where professional training of a doctor may be included in a professional experience completed in another field of specialization, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the questionable situation.
However, given that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it is recommended to consult the relevant Department of Health (the Department of Science and Medicine) as the Ministry of Health of the Law provides advice and consultation services related to the inclusion in and progress of specialisation education.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, whose member must be each doctor.
Doctors from Halab, Syria, are asking for U.S. intervention.
The United States did not make any effort to end the siege (the rebel part of the city by government troops) and did not use its influence to promote the protection of civilians, the AFP said in a letter addressed to the White House.
“We don’t need tears, compassion, and even prayers; we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over Eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halab isn’t surrounded again,” the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support the army loyal to President Bashar Assad, have announced that they will stop strikes in the Halab area every three hours from today to allow safe passages to humanitarian forces.
From 9:00 to 12:00, all military activities, air strikes and artillery are to be stopped.
UN humanitarian operations chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed this, but stressed that at least a two-day ceasefire was needed.
According to the AFP, 15 out of 35 doctors working in the eastern part of Halab are already in control of the rebels.
During the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel death of countless patients, friends, and colleagues.
The world looks and observes how complex Syria is, but does little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like slightly covered threats, have been touched by pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Over the past month, there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria, 15 of which are at hospitals where they work.
We are most saddened to have to decide who lives and who dies.
Small children come to us on standby with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, we describe doctors.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when the explosion interrupted the supply of oxygen to their incubators.
They took a breath, and then their life ended - before he could really start, they remembered.
The army, loyal to President Bashar Assad, supported by Russian forces, has surrounded the rebels controlled by the eastern part of Halab in recent weeks, with over 200,000 people inside.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes by the Russian and Syrian Air Forces, managed to break the encirclement on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then increased in the city and its surroundings.
