A great return of the Czech loser is coming.
Paul French was called to the NHL
The Czech hockey goalie Pavel French, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A thirty-three-year-old Plzeň native will be on a turnout, so he could soon get into the goal.
Former goaltender of Lithuania, Pilsen and Russian Celiabinsk were injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
It was in the middle of the Vegas game that he was changing, and since then he hasn't introduced himself to NHL rinks.
The incident occurred the moment the experienced goalie moved from one stick to another.
“Pavel French will be outside of about three to four weeks with an injury to the lower body,” he announced from Denver at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goal finally extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning of American time he was called from a farm where he captured four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, 94.5% of the procedures were credited.
A breeder of Plzeň hockey wants to finally establish himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year, he had problems with his hips, and in the shorten pandemic year he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL, the Frenchman captured 36 games, and his success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts on his Christmas wish, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate as this year's Christmas wish chose a family photograph taken during the trip to Jordan.
He also published his wish to Prince Charles, who used a photograph in which his wife Camille at the races helps to wear a dress.
On her website, the BBC UK intelligence station informed about this.
They send their wishes to their friends, co-workers, and to the foundations they work with.
Photographs were made somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color and the dress is also made by Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing just like princes George and Louis shorts and a t-shirt with a collar.
Whoever took the photograph, William and Kate didn't do it, it's not clear when exactly it was created.
Last year the royal family for photography intended as a Christmas wish posed on a package of straw in front of a pile of wood in her rural estate in Norfolk County.
The film, which serves as a Christmas wish, also published a successor to Prince Charles' throne with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught them in June in Ascot.
Charles, who's got a cylinder on his head and on his face, helps Camille put on her dress in color with a light dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbro a million for the title, Hardy denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case reportedly worked with the fact that the accused former Vice-President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have received from Prague Slavia the promised million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the efotbal.cz server about it, with him getting into some of the police files.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors, Jaroslav Hlepík, stated that they had not committed any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavie is mainly her former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up in the championship club last summer.
Some of the powerful Red and White Officers, according to the census, was in frequent contact with both Berbra and former sports director of the Vyšehrad Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also in the case of the accused.
Criminalists reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbro had promised her a financial reward for getting the title.
2019 team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authority has been aware that Roman (Berbr) is to receive from SK Slavia Praha the promised million-dollar bribe, quoted the server from the file.
A day later, according to CSI, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of Slavie Hardík.
According to the server, the file no longer shows whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The hard man refused any corruption.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively sought to change the ratios in Czech football and offered an opposite alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal conduct, sought to influence referees in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial fulfillments in this context," said the Harder for the List of Reports.
In wiretaps among other things, Nezmar is indiscriminately insulting some former Slavie players with dark skins, and also slandering his former head of the Hard Guy.
The case of alleged influence of matches through referees started last October police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
Berbr is the highest in the aphery, which is no longer established in any of the football functions.
In the middle of January, like former sports director Vyšehrad Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
They will be new, but in principle worse type (the artillery must carry bullets from the armored cab and carry bullets manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - on a decent level, in addition, they managed to get rid of Prague V3S even in specialised units.
Aircraft: combative- decent, but at the end of rent, transport - too small with a short flight but modern.
Drony - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have anything (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold-rolling, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I've got a story.
I got a chase right next to the city.
From the river there were nutries and damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that there was a fisherman on the shore of the river.
I didn't want to be a mess, so I just sat back and I guess the guy didn't notice me.
I was hoping she'd leave before something came up, but, of course, the fox went away a little while ago.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman had almost fucked up, he'd waved his head all over the side, so I called him and said it was on the fox.
He was gone before I got off the stand.
I mean, the meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a match of many coincidences to make something happen, you'd probably be seen in a thermovision that everyone has today.
So in a visible place, expensive data to your feet in a sleeping bag, and you should be fine.
Soldier versus Hamack.
The interior got more cheap respondents than the Ministry of Health.
The state, responsible for buying and distributing the drapes, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns in recent weeks on their acquisition.
The iRoblas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts to the respirator were different by up to one hundred crowns.
Why were prices so dramatic?
Which authorities have been acting economically?
And why else did they buy a railway?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to the server editor iRoblaska Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate the soldiers and the army (I'm probably not affected by the memories of ČSLA, which have undergone the older generation), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory military.
We don't even have large warehouses of techniques that can take hold of training, we don't actually have modern technology for existing professionals, and modern technology is still more complicated, so the ability of the pagers will be rapidly wasting time.
There will be no time to practice anyone again in modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can put on.
And in the end, postmen/territorial defenses are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where they go to lead mass geril and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
In the Czech Republic there will be a fight only in the conflict of such extent and intensity, where the Gerila will be irrelevant, and we do not have the right geography to do so.
We don't have individual skills.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is, half of them play like they do.
Then there's a situation where you look like a loser who hasn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago, he's in the attack alone between two or even three Swiss and you're saying, "twitter, and what do you think is gonna happen now?"
Well, of course, they'll pick him up like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skills of "indulging a defender" is so terrible that I caught myself honestly surprised to see that our attacker was able to rob one of his opponents.
First flag
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts for the following weeks do not expect any major twist.
The influx of hospitals according to statistical models lasted some time, and the pandemic equation was added, as is known, to the new unknown: a variant of omicron, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much it helps to vaccinate or post-infective immunity obtained by previous examination of the disease.
But this week's Covid equation also entered an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, antivirotide molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and related hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be supplemented by a paxlood by Pfizer, which reports success rate of up to 85 percent.
However, the first delivery of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how it was prepared for the incoming drugs of the local administration.
As it was said, the first to get to the domestic patients of Merck mollupiravir.
The company ended up on tape first and because the medicine began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find suitable treatment for viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
This research often forgets that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and openly do not share their views.
But Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how our beak grew."
See, you do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of the people will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they'll tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are a racist jerk.
And then they go and vote the sides as AfD.
He's afraid of the cancel culture, saying this in public means losing his job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they'll find out what people think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmour, they both have over 20% according to the survey.
We even know that objects are in Czech three and completely identical.
It's identical to turning units so soldiers don't have to learn where what is, so all objects on the hair are the same.
One is Atom Brdy Museum, and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, the sssr didn't want to have a nuclear warhead on its own territory either because of safety or speed of deployment of the warheads due to its western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only the warheads, not the whole rockets, as they say, were preserved.
If it was necessary to put this weapon, a special unit arrived that picked up this warhead and installed it on some carrier device.
Besides the museum maple, the rest are in a desolation state.
At second grade, we had a classmate named Cigán, and we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he was making good jokes, he was showing up a lot, but he was our mascot.
Everyone was talking to him, he used to walk around, and he wanted to explain something, he was missing little, he walked regularly, he used to do sports with us, he didn't steal snacks, he didn't take phones, he walked straight away.
He also went to school in nature, did various monkey houses, but he was fine, maybe never shit.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings entered the same class, another class.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, and they often handled something there, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something to ad (old things, things I don't need, etc.) and I've often sold to the Ciganians, money always had, didn't try to reach me for some attempts at price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called in a month and said he'd already prescribed it.
I'm saying about myself that I'm not racist, I don't care if anyone is white, black, yellow, blue or anything else, as long as he's acting like he's in a decent society (working, working, women don't beat, just acting normal).
But when someone comes in, stretches out his hand, houses and flats, just messes around, troubles... whatever color he's wearing, but I'm gonna mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, they start to do business, work, learn language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my tradition and culture, I'll be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatik
“A young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and, despite the resuscitation care, unfortunately, she fell under the right of spokesperson Zuzana Fajtlová of South Bohemia’s medical rescue workers.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who drove the girl.
The 18-year-old vehicle driver of Peugeot was probably driving in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavaria and from undetected causes he went out into the opposite direction in the turn.
After the collision with Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended on the roof off the road, described an accident by South Bohemia police spokesperson Štěpánka Schwarzová.
A young driver of Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
It was multiple injuries and remained trapped in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute pre-patient care and, in stable condition, he was air transported to a Czech hospital, said rescue nurse Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was transported to the hospital.
New rules apply to non-EU parcels, customers often do not provide data on them
Lukas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He buys collectible cards.
“It can usually be tens of dollars, say, from ten dollars higher, where it still pays to be imported, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free,” says the collector.
Since October, it has been slightly expensive to order small consignments, it has to add VAT and post the data for the customs procedure.
He'll have an e-mail report that customs are expecting a package coming in.
Then it is sufficient to fill out the data on the consignment, and if the VAT did not include the trader already on sale, the customs office will determine it from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange for the customs procedure itself, the overall amount must also be added to the fee to the carrier.
According to Luke Neuheisl, the whole process isn't complicated.
I'm gonna click one or two of the check boxes, put in two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a five-minute question, says Neuheisl.
But not all the shipments are able to deliver smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of consignments received from abroad from 60 thousand to 15 thousand decreased to international post office in Prague.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to the requests to provide the data they need to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 shipments to the international post office that we need to process.
If people were to fill in all the data they needed and fill them in in in time, we would be here about half way, says the spokesperson of the Czech Post.
Inflation solutions
See the title, how would you suggest solving current inflation?
We are currently 9.9% of inflation and are expected to grow further.
What do you think it should do to slow this growth down or compensate?
Do we see, in Poland, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable about where it's going?
Prices are growing faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, added (who's the employee)?
I've been added 2% in gross this year, which is a laugh, but luckily, I have a similar income from the business I run at work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why the persuasively convicted rapists are sending themselves behind bars for, like, six months?
This doesn't just take my head off how a court can only send an animal to jail for six months just to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to his/her victim being traumatized for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention the rape victim never has to recover from it again.
Won't this even dissuade the potential future rape report of the victims?
A man from the Tomb "fired" his girlfriend from the Kostomlat
A man from Hrob was reluctantly helped by the officers to secure his totally wanted girlfriend from the Kostomlat, to whom he was given an arrest warrant.
He himself called them to her.
He went through it with a detour.
He first approached the passer and made up a story that he was robbed.
After a call, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when he told them that the alleged "cloaked" had made up everything that the officers had come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to make a statement to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of a man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a national search, and was given a warrant to arrest her.
The case is therefore addressed by the Czech Republic.
Honestly, for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we are no longer ethnically or culturally speaking, but I am interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with me, of course, that it is a pity that Churchill has failed to secure the release of Prague USA :'.
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slovenian language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe anything completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there is an estimate in the world, if I'm not mistaken, about 10,000 different religions.
Then what god or gods should you choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that there is at least one god in any of those thousands of religions who will unkindly punish you if you believe in another God.
But it also stands in the tenatre, that there is no god but Jahveh.
Wouldn't it be more rational to abstain from faith in any god than to risk choosing the wrong of the thousands of gods, and that one real god that I haven't just hit, sends me to hell or some place like this?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specialties, X months per one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All ACRs could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak as follows: The cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies fishing in schools, and there is a kind of intervening, when the workforce emigrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only when growing up, but this process is ongoing all the time, each of us constantly learning something new, going from one branch to the other, etc.
Similar prolapsing should work also between the civilian and military sectors.
I see this as a way of building a kind of relationship between a citizen and an army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that the Russian, the German or the Mongolian invader will never come in again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is carved into stone, we have allies, and they're going to stop us from getting in trouble.
Oh, please, Lord.
One choice in the U.S. is enough to twist their budget, and NATO's all going to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have shown themselves once more that they just show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long worked as a guarantee of independence is an armed army and a population who can control the military technology of its time.
And today, she can pilot remote-controlled devices every teenager, so it wouldn't work.
We don't need a border fortification, that sucks today, but an engrossed teenager behind a book of remote controlled equipment can handle it.
How to not drown in a box tsunami
Will you unwrap presents under the Christmas tree, and suddenly you're at home wrapped with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" uses e-shops that lack packaging materials.
It has therefore created a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them as one-time waste.
Anyone can bring to the trade (map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings in agreement.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid crowded blue containers.
The trade itself welcomes the packaging that is currently in the market lack and also the money saved, as the packaging carton has recovered by 50% over the last period.
Moreover, in the eyes of environmentally sound customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco drugs and eco cosmetics.
However, the boxes and filling material in Popovek near Brno are also addressed to us by companies with which we have scheduled regular removals of the bins.
We'll use everything to pack the shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to the next generation, says Petra Lopušníková of Tierry.
However, the application www.KAMSNIM.cz shows not only the sampling sites for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take the sorted waste from the household, where to hand over past drugs, tyres, used electro, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
So all the garbage can end up in the right place, and in addition, re-useable things will find their second home.
The total project map contains over 100,000 such places.
“Thereafter, collection courts, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity stores, SWAPs and other places to help find applications for things that would otherwise become waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Uklíjtět Czech Republic.
It seems to me that nowadays the technique is so simple and stupid, that children who use a computer or phone are playing games on it, but don't learn basic computer skills.
A recent problem (mainly English articles) has emerged that students of higher education do not understand the principle of components on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps to photos or actually mobile phones in general simply hides the underlying filesystem with folders and puts everything on one screen in the app.
I don't want them using technology since they were kids, but let's just let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency earlier this weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he revealed the Presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and he mentioned so many actions that in six months they could not be achieved.
The French politicians like it that way, and the voters like it.
Macron's supporters of stride between the right and the left agree to a small one, but it is in Europe that we do.
And in France there will be a new election of the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for this work of historians.
A number of commentators have come up with criticisms that Macron is a pro-European propaganda, and he's rewritten history.
In fact, it's trying to defend history.
The regional right-wing candidate for the French President Éric Zemmmour is now going around France with the idea that the regime from Vichy, which collaborating with Hitler during the Second World War, was not so bad, and has been quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea to one history book seriously, and let's not look at the events in France.
Wouldn't she be needed?
Students in European countries learn a lot of history as a story we versus them and never as a whole story.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who beat who in the battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what was the broader context of the event.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mys" didn't win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won the award for the directorship and for the best actress Jasna Duričová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he kept his first audience rankings.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was about "to have the flu/be thirsty" A few days I had diarrhoea and didn't have much taste of smoking...
It's been worse than regular flu.
I don't have diarrhoea in the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that's how everyone has it.)

In his second stage, photographer Sixak tried to capture the essence of small towns and Czech companies.
A story of a return to roots that turns out to be just a longed illusion.
The Czech and Comparatist carry the fairy tale of the Red Carousel to the stage of the current village.

And that going back to your instincts is shorter than being willing to admit
In his last novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we used to listen.
Those who have stayed, and those who have left, know too little about themselves to spend it on a life together.
Trains start driving according to the new timetable, somewhere changes carriers
From Sunday to Sunday, trains begin to ride on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to ride instead of the Czech Railways.
For most lines only the time of departure or their route will be adjusted slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The ticket sales were started by the carrier during the fall.
The Czech Railways plan daily on average 6783 passenger transport connections in the new timetable, of which the average of 478 long-distance trains will be daily.
Trains run approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
The railways next to national connections under the new timetable will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company and the new timetable will set up dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains that will be on the links from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be taken by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will traditionally increase prices from next year, on average 3.2 per cent.
Railways take inflation into their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to the R23 Ústí nad Labem line – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace the Czech Railways after success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
Every day, RegioJet will issue a total of 16 connections on the track, eight in every direction.
Further changes relate to long-range connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop from Sunday at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express maintained his 16 connections, two reverse connections to Slovakia and a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to the spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, the carrier also tried to maintain the closest possible driving times of its long-distance trains despite planned lockout work.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier also changes in certain regional lines.
The changes await passengers for example to Czechoslovakia, where on the line from Mladá Boleslav to Česká Lipa do Rumburk, the Trilex trains of the German company Die LänderBahn will take place in the Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to benefit from a uniform rail fare for the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3,2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn to look at the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed, and they had to work, they died.
I've never heard teaching from a slave party's point of view or since then, no one's defending this, just condemning.
Nobody even tells you in school that blacks often sold black themselves into slavery and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one will teach you that colonizers often bought land from Indians, they'll tell you everywhere, how brutally we Europeans have murdered them, and they've killed each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, directly in schools, both in Northern and Southern schools.
I did not face the fact that someone deliberately silenced the facts, but I have heard earlier that this is happening and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (for instance, atrocities from WW2 are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it today, without understanding.
History doesn't care about someone's feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never do this again.
By the way, while we're at the southern states, yes, the confederate flag and famous slaves are quite popular there, on the other hand they also had some good successes and I found it absurd to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as it has been idealized by a lot of people these days.
And a lot of people forget that not all of them were slaves on the South, and a lot of things were against them.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, deliberately miss some facts, lie and manipulate, and perhaps our view of them does not exist (YT was also a video of the television, where someone who started talking about our legions and 1968).
What seemed ridiculous to me at U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that never occurred to their country.
In general, it seemed to me that at some universities it was terrible, the students were very betrayed and the schools supported them many times.
And if I imagine that these people are going to be much older once, I feel a little sick that this might be the voice of the majority, because between the young and the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has already achieved what it has, and it's not about the same thing, it has been excitable.
At present, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with him and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalisation on the other hand, when it often leads to resistance even to quite reasonable things.
Plus, the more radical someone is, the more hearing it is.
Anyway, I didn't meet with anyone judging me for colonialism or slavery either.
Rather I met with a bad geography, but it was two-sided :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely unfamiliar.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do alone?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary from a point of view of some personal identity.
If I'm involved with people, then I'm connected to the interests of the world, the views of the world, and the experiences of the world, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a really good guy, he's got a sermon about theology rather than politics, but then he's always going to fuck up some cocotine about the coronavirus that everyone's ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Church of Czechoslovakia Hussite.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born of Catholic modernity and are actually Catholic without the Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to the Hussite church because it's theologically very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise, St. Michal's church on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do Mass in Latin as it was done before the Vatican II.
Plamenek from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took him from Austria
Břeclav – Plamenek lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna for it because of the coronavirus pandemic, but this morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing.
They took over the border last year.
Bethlehem's light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate with the section every year, and I look forward to doing so much.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, to tell the journalists who are present to the Scout Amalia Budíková.
While the transfer took place last year at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually Boy Scouts ride a train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes for the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
The scouts have traditionally taken the scouts to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocese bishop Vojtěch Cikrlem.
The Scout couriers, who will travel with selected speeds and passenger trains, will take care of the subsequent light distribution on Saturday 18 December.
From them, they will take the light in local scout stations or volunteers who will then continue to spread the flames in the Czech Republic and where the colleges do not lead.
Also this year the scouts must adhere to the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear dresses, try to keep their distances, it was as small as possible not to sing colleagues, just to act as safe as possible, to describe the spokesperson of the Zuzana Hrbková's light action.
The tradition of the Betlémian light that travels by Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the thought of peace, friendship and peace at the same time.
Bethlehem’s light is a symbol of hope, of light that overcomes darkness.
Scouts and scouts have been in the Czech Republic for more than 30 years.
The event stands on hundreds of volunteers, as well as flames, is a symbol of indiscipline and human interdependence.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for flames, can be found on www.betlemskestlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies to cancer are economic, but I don't think grant as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education make good use of the money, but I don't understand why they put the money in agriculture, industry and all of them.
As mentioned - a useless product is produced and it wrecks the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work alone in a factory where in the hallways there are a million signs "xy financed/co-financed by the xy project" and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This isn't the firm's support that gives work to x people, this is the frenzy of development when this firm hangs out and takes up contracts/employee to companies that could grow up and be more productive after it's gone.
Absolute consent, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born at Internet times gets caught in some kind of trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think the Internet commercials are moving with me, but then I find that they've influenced me too - it's just so fancy that you don't always defend yourself.
For this reason, I also support radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently wish to give an absolute ban on programming (= targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, the words of the classic - I wouldn't let the Internet go.
I feel like this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe anything that most believe and makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I prefer to believe something less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion about which I will claim it is critical thinking."
2. "I will never believe anything the media say"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
The TVs have gone through the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere this year has two hundred
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English speaking countries have gone through the trend of Christmas movies and will be presented to their viewers in the premiere this year by record more than two hundred.
The operator of the IMDb film database calculated this.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has scored and significantly increased the ratings, so these films are becoming more and more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas ( Christmas) in their name, so in fact there will be many more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, mainly fairy tales are associated with this period; worldwide, there are also popular pictures alone at home, Love Heavenly or Classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
But the true boom of Christmas pictures started in 2009, when a special film series arrived in the American TV station Hallmark, reminded the BBC server.
Her adventure project, Countdown to Christmas, then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began to tune its Christmas viewers on October 22 and will present 42 Christmas pictures in total.
Lifetime Station has 35 new films on the program this year with Christmas themes and favorite streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total sum.
“In this magical period of story, it does not matter so much, it is important that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it snows,” wrote Brandon Gray, author of a book on Christmas movies called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I’ll be at home for Christmas movies).
“For the audience, it is a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm in the middle of all the holiday madness and madness of the world in which we have lived for the last few years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark still uses the same recipe for his movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who will fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which is a successful solution, and those two will kiss.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, they complement Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, will not intervene in the final F1 race.
Only 19 riders go to the Great Price of Abu Kill in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19 and will not intervene until the last race of the season.
The Haas stable only sends one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season he was supposed to attack a better location from the 20th place he made in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas Station will not hit the Great Price of Abu Kill in the end.
He was tested positive for covid-19.
Thus, only 19 cars appear on the starting grid, from the last line to the track of Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will compete for the title in a direct battle against Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepin is quite well, according to the expression of the Haas stable and shows no symptoms.
Nikita's physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, with safety as a final priority for all stakeholders," said the representatives of formula1.com.
He can't even send a replacement rider to the Haas race.
Any alternate would have to be qualified or driven on another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not facing the first racer.
At the start of the just finished season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year they were positive tested Sergio Pérez No. Lewis Hamilton.
They can arrest you for this, too.

From the point of view of the law, the covid is on the list of infectious diseases.
In the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.

Honey, silver and 150 diamonds: The pricelist of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store and the creator put six months of work into it and all his savings.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience in my home never carried sweaters,” admits Lebanon, who spent 3000 hours on his work in six months.
Silk bought in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
"The foundation is wool and cotton, but silk supplies a sweater of silk," praises the creator of his work, which does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I am completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Lebanon.
If he succeeds, he will create a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago was "only" CZK 720 000.

The government has approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Females, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with border protection with Belarus and the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states, in connection with several months of ongoing actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle East countries with false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already active in the Polish territory.
The Omikron mutation is spreading south of Moravia?
Hygiene's looking into another case of a child from Adam's.
“We are currently reporting further suspicions of this variant in another child from Adam’s preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov University is not demonstrated," said Ciupek.
Six cases appeared in the county last week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague,” said the director.
She added that she was two nurses from one department at the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, and two 11-year-old students from the Adamov School of Education.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adam.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the Director, four unsympathetic course.
No one suspected of Omikron travelling abroad
None of them traveled abroad, nor any of their families, have come into contact with anyone who would stay abroad.
The connection to the championship in the water pole is none of the mentioned, said Ciupek.
The chief hygienist Pavela Svrčinová previously stated that an international tournament in the water pole was being examined in Brno a few weeks ago.
There were players from South Africa and one Belgian player got sick after returning.
California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas on the ban on abortion.
The Governor of California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday the plan to introduce a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the population of the U.S. state by means of a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial abortion law following the detection of the heart rate of embryos.
People should then be entitled to compensation when suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and guns made in California.
The announcement of Newsome responded to the opinion of the US Supreme Court on Friday, which left the Texaan abortion ban in force, although it is against almost 50 years of old precedent, which laid down the right to an abortion in the entire U.S. area by about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court of First Instance has now not decided on the constitutionality of the whole of the law, but on the technical question resulting from the innovative construction of the measures.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was passed on to the public, making the Texas republican impossible to attack the usual judicial route.
“I am outraged by yesterday’s (fifth) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported the Texas maneuver in order to protect its law,” said the California Governor.
"If countries can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He said that he had instructed his subordinates to work in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would entitle the public representative to enforce the ban on attack rifles and so-called spirit weapons.
In this way, they are identified as weapons produced by the Tomb, which do not have serial numbers and which can serve to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to be entitled to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over CZK 220 000) and judicial expenses from anyone who would produce, distribute or sell attack rifles, components to "arms of ghosts" or sets for their production.
“If the most effective way is to keep these horrific weapons out of our streets, to create a threat of private actions, then we should do it precisely,” the California Governor said.
AP notes that California has banned the production and sale of certain weapons of military style for decades, but in June, the federal judge here blocked the ban as an anti-impositionary.
If the State were to restore the ban by the use of the Texas template, the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor would be confirmed, which, in an unacceptable opinion on Friday's majority verdict, warned against the extension of the legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant full immunity to judicial review to the Texas abortion ban and allowed abortion clinics to continue their actions against selected South State officials.
Every emergency vaccination has its public test phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination schedule will look like and also improves the vaccine itself, based on the results.
For example, Israel is already in a large four-dose study.
And according to these studies, most of the patients have had a 5-fold increase in antibodies, which already has a long-term effect on you.
Just like any other vaccination will have his vaccination schedule after a while, it's just too early for that.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine should be placed on the market, based on an inactivated virus which, according to specifications, promises to be more effective than 10 times.

Poland has threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act in violation of the law if it exercised new powers and stopped paying money to Poland because of the dispute on the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for drawing €36 billion from the EU Fund for the recovery of the economy hit by a pandemic covid-19.
And it is under pressure of the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this extortion by the EU by veto on all matters which require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small party Solidarity Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose a close majority in Sejmo.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will require Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable, given that the EU is rightly rejecting our resources from the common budget, which we are also contributing to, the Polish Minister has added.
Its party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling party to Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, changes in Polish justice for Ziobrov's actions threaten its independence and submit it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels builds “ineligible conditions, because its objective is not the rule of law, but the change of the government in Poland”.
Warsaw faces “the political dictatorship implemented by blackmailing and by attempting to subdue the democratic decisions of several million Poles”, Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to such concessions as would reduce the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree to Poland's status as a colony," he said.
But to know about it... there's one kind of cheese in Lidlu in four different places.
I haven't looked at other things, I've met one yogurt several times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes on the dairy shelf, I resigned and I asked.

For two years I've been watching the data being handled here like manure, most of the opponents of vaccination are just a little more off the hook than most of the supporters of vaccination.

Ugh, so I took it easy.
I'm sorry for the discount, and I wish you all a good day.
They punished me when I was a kid with a spoon.
It was never because of the stamps, most of the time it was just that I refused to listen and angry repeatedly (read instead of going to bed, fighting my brother, etc.).
At the same time I was never punished without notice, my mother always threatened that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after the next "capture" of the cook only brought and put it down so I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few wounds on the butt (over the clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and scale) are beneficial because the child responds to them much more than words.
I think it's important that part of the warning is important, because it gives the child his choice to listen and get it, or he'll get better and he won't be punished.
In the end, all I had to do was give me a warning to start listening.
System Defense
When the major Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cep replied in 1999 to a journalistic question about what the Czech Constitution meant for him – whether the sacred letter to which she swore and which she was about to learn at school, or on the contrary, the agreement that could be changed if necessary was certainly to the first concept.
Once in a constitution, we agreed on democratic rules in our life, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
As the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, he then voted the question Vojtěch Cep.
In recent times, however, there has been a growing view of the fact that the Czech Constitution needs changes.
For years it is tested by situations that its creators (which Vojtěch Cepl belonged to) could not predict, for example, the behavior of the elected president.
But Cep was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be thought through.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then it can be the key to dealing with most of the crises that society across history encounters.
The Constitution is, among other things, a rule of governance consisting of individual rules which lay down the policies of the manniels of the game.
We are afraid that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we are bound by bans.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno they fight for life of a few months' baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder to children, there are also difficult cases that hospitals have faced mainly recently.
"We know that children are at risk and hit less than adults, 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, the new chief of the Clinic of Child Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Faculty of Brno and Faculty of Medicine.
The course is much easier, easier, often without symptoms.
But there are children's patients with coronavir who are severely ill, which we see especially in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at the children's infectious diseases clinic.
Really, very sick children with coronavir have been on the ARU lately.
Children with post-covid syndrome were continuously at the doctor’s department throughout the year.
“Now there is an increase in acute covid pneumonia, which means pneumonia, which requires a stay on the resuscitation bed,” he said, adding that this disease interferes with adults as well as adolescents and also with a few months’ babies.
In hospitals, too, there are children in severe condition due to coronavir.
“We now have a child of months and age,” the prime minister said.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths have been recorded at the FN Brno Children's Hospital so far.
According to available data, six children aged between 0 and 14 years were killed in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominika, the psychologist is an integral part of the collaboration at the children's hospital – not only in the coronavir department.
At the same time, it also warns of the fact that, as in adults and children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
“Therefore, the vaccine is recommended in children,” the doctor said.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk along marked paths.
But the peace zones aren't that big.

Generally in national parks outside the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but do not climb the fence into the field).
Skiing/riding on a bike in the forest outside the marked road must not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but, of course, it does not take so much care of outside national parks).

China builds the impression of disease and the fact that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jirous: China builds the impression of disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has gone to health and political offensive.
A few months ago Beijing reflected criticism for failing to stop a disease that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country's reporting zero increments of the infected.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective aids and Chinese doctors are often helping to combat coronavirus, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing?
Is this about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend of mine meets and says to him, "Hey, don't you want an elephant?"

Well, that's just great.
If you want $5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Hey, buddy, let's go high five, it's gonna be great...
After a while, they'll meet, and the one who bought the complaining: dude, what did you sell that for an elephant?????
The lawn's busted, the giant shit, the car's all over the place, the kids are fighting him, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The one who sold says, "You don't talk very well about a elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that...
World events are controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states is valid, it is the powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
It is still working at the level of economic and political (in selected issues), but there is still no military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years from now.
But maybe mid-centurys will be different, and it'll work.
I thought about it, too, and it's possible enough.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'll have a word.
I'm just based on the fact that ellipse mostly includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another commentary on "Spain Oranges and Mandarins", when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas it is no longer clear that they are from Spain with "Spain Fruit and Mandarins".
In addition, I assume that the sentence is "all American forces" including their weapons and that I know that American complexes are only operated by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad concept and there is no need to further specify it with the American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying:D
Either way, it's a senseless request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey of spaceman Milly
Terrifying images show the moment when the scared monkey crouched in the toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed her and laughed at her.
Holland’s monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate Court of Gwent now banned her from breeding animals for life, informed The Sun.
Experts at the monkey rehab who care for Milly after her abuse said they've never seen such a scared spaceman before.
Milly has spent nearly two years rehabilitating with Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now he is happy again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
Four-fold mother confessed to two accusations of unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment at the Gwent Master's Court with a conditional deferral for one year.
Holland has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, has been banned from breeding animals for life and has to pay CZK 12,000 of judicial costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue.”
Milly took a while to get used to people again.
She'd knead and hide from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement would make her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, she can still cause panic in her view of new people.
The psychological scars of abuse will follow her forever, supplied by Sawyer.
Milly's extortion came out after the G.D.P.D. found scary shots in the wife's phone after a raid at her apartment for a drug charge.
On the shots, you can hear Milly texting vulgarly.
The next video says, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possession of cocaine with a view to selling it.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (in the count of less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months, and Holland was sentenced to 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from that realm three times in a row if you bravely jump the entire 20th century?
You mean in freshman year, you're gonna carry the same things you were in sixth grade?
And this whole thing kills the idea of bifling, when no one, the honor of exceptions, doesn't care if you know or understand.
Just write a test on one, and then no one cares.
Go and on the street, accidentally ask yourself if you can handle the character of quadratic equation roots and coefficients.
Everyone's been through this, and the absolute majority doesn't even check out and tell you they're totally screwed.
So what the fuck is he learning about?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the fact is, people don't want people and don't need them.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get it in.
It's partly learning for the many people who need the thing.
But, like, the point that you really don't need all of this at the machine, I was totally serious... because you just don't need it.
In addition, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is the sign of punk.
(What our communist past and anger against educated people and elites are likely to be involved in here) However, the price of barbarists standing at these machines is simply high.

Wedding at first sight: The war of Kadri and Andrea continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave now," Andrea replied to the Instagram in Stories on all the questions of curious fans who so disappointed her on Kadrim that it decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
It's been between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move to see her, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only ended with love, but rather grew in mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he got angry with Kadri's turnover in response to Andre's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged sincerity with her ex-wife was no longer popular with his little sister Linda.
She decided to stand up for her brother.
I don't normally talk about these things at all, and we never really said these things to each other in our family.
I don't want to make any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to hurt publicly and get the name of someone I love so much, she's just not gonna give it to me!
I'm sorry I have to do this this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family, when we needed it most, even though he was young.
I'm more sorry if I have to read such untruthing information that's probably out of context.
I would love to know Kadi as much as I, our loved ones and family, are in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what it says, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the reality, and we know what it really was, added indefinitely.
The drunk thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You're not gonna believe what it's for.
He started his robbery expedition in a parking lot in the residential area where he tried to get into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stolen from one vehicle in a conversion of less than CZK 330.
Then he didn't think of anything better than climbing up to the 5th floor and walking into the apartment through an open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
On video from one security camera, he's caught walking down the street from the scene of the crime and eating the banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up this morning, he found out the bananas weren't where they were, and he called the police.
It was later that Cchaa arrested.
A man confessed to drinking alcohol on an incriminating day.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob.
The whole thing is under investigation so far.
The monkey climbed the facade to the fifth floor where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is time-limited and effectively linked to a pandemic emergency.
If it's cancelled, the law won't be effective.
Although the law limits the scope of business
Is that not enough for you for a reason?
The right to collect will be limited, but not revoked.
Over 60 percent of the voters came to Saturday’s elections at four municipalities
On Saturday, people elected in Komňa, Uherskohradiště, Lužice na Mosteck, Nová Ves na Liberecku and in Rovná na Pelhřimov.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law established number or the elected council has broken down here.
There were 99 candidates on Saturday on the total of 28 mandates.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
The process of Saturday's election results is symbolically closing down a rather demanding but successful year for us.
It has made a total of four new or repeated elections to local representatives and, above all, the very monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said the Vice-President of ČSÚ Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the Covida-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding on equipment and personnel security.
In the Chamber in Uherskohradiště, the Saturday elections won the Association of Independent candidates, which won 27.76 % of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member office.
STAN has received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means the profit of two mandates.
Two seats in the office were won by citizens for the Chamber, and 18.52 percent of the voters voted for them.
Once again, she became the mayor of Jan Křižková, who is a member of the Privates.
The Komňans – independent candidates – have reached one mandate in the Ministry.
75.48 percent of the eligible voters came to the urn.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimov the association Pro Rovnou won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two other representatives from the Association of Independent candidates 1 and one of the Association of Independent candidates 2 have entered the municipal council.
The vote was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in the Lužica in Mosteck won again the Lužice and Svinčice association led by Mayor Henry John.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes and, as in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-member office.
The second candidate for the people who voted 43.27 percent of the voters ended, so he will have three representatives.
76.7 percent of the voters came to the urn.
The elections in Nová Vša in Liberec won the Hope for New Ves before the Yes movement.
59.88 % of the voters voted for the associations of independent candidates and obtained four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
YES received 40.12 percent of the vote and, against the proper elections in 2018, strengthened, gained more mandate and has three.
The vote was 42.9 percent of the vote.
On Monday, the election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all these things that people write to you.
You're just playing dumb to have a fight with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from the aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal for them to look good).
And I don't really care who believes in it.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had taken, how much it had taken to suppress science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, e.g. the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do with it.
A man fell head down from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, in which the rescue workers of the Regional Rescue Service were involved.
The regional operational centre staff took over an hour after Saturday midnight a distress call with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two ZZS crews – medical and medical – went to the site immediately.
On arrival at the hospital, a 27 - year - old man was supposed to fall from a window about 12 - foot [12 m] high and fall head on concrete!
Coal was caught in the Vitkovice.
But not the way it should be, and the firemen went into action.
At the time of arrival of the rescue service teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intubating physician intubated his respiratory pathways, ensured artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after further measures within the pre-patient care, the ambulance vehicle transported him to further care of the Ostrava trauma center, informed the spokesperson of the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
More worried than Coronavir, I have from inappropriate public and public reactions
The spread of coronavir in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and health professionals are mainly standing in the first line of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking David's military doctor.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Olivia defended the belt.
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
There were things going on at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña was able to defeat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who has not found a Slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in a light weight, he did a great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defend the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly wiped out Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise that no one expected.
That's what brought a woman's bantam-weight fight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American woman entered each other as an imaginary "twarf," because Nunes hasn't lost seven years and she's been grinding her teeth to another triumph.
Moreover, the start of the duel took place in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes has started the way for victory very actively, and the opponent has even delivered a push kick that sent her to the ground.
But the money did not get her to make any more mistakes, and she failed to attempt to attack herself by using her arm lever.
The second round was strenuous and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both rivals participated in a lot of excellent hits and hard hooks.
Plus, Nunes got to the ground where she started to strangle her.
She had to give up trying to knock off the attack.
An American woman so prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became a new champion.
The top of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a title in a light weight.
At first Poirier was better off, but the card began to turn.
In the latter, he tried to be more active, Oliver, who tried to beat his opponent with a hand lever.
Although he failed to do so, then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back, and he hit him with a series of wounds.
The second round won.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear of a naked choke, to which Poirier resisted for a while, but then he had to knock off the strangle.
The Brazilian defends the title, on the contrary Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley wrote down a sovereign triumph, which in the first round he put a hard right back on Raulian Paiv.
He then beat him with a series of precisely sized strikes and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little girl, now she lost after seven years.
The hip, or the hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most of the essential names in Czech are expressed by only one grammatical family, and therefore it is not difficult for them to determine whether it is a male, female or middle family.
But then there is also a relatively numerous group of essential names where the family is not stable.
Such important names fluctuate between two families.
They then acquire double ends when tilting, and in some cases they remain inconclusive.
For example, the words "stirl" or "knife" are male and female, in which the first tends to follow the pattern of "the machine", in the second according to the pattern of "the song".
For other groups of essential names, different shapes are already in the first fall of the single number, such as ‘line/line’, ‘kidluben/kidlubna’ or ‘brambor/brambora’ (for the purposes of food).
Both shapes are written, they have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as "courage" in the Czech Republic and "courage" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is indescribable, similar are the other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "kop" and "kop", "kopliha" and "koplih" etc.
Some words that entered the Czech language from other languages were originally inconsistent but gradually take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression ‘image’, which is male and female, or the word ‘but’ that remained in the middle race inconclusive, but has the endings according to the pattern ‘garden’.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What's the situation right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants who are trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people started to travel to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped to stop them.
European politicians promise to support Greece, humanitarian aid is also planned by the Czech Government.
In fact, what motivates refugees to travel uncertainly?
And what's the situation right here?
We haven't seen the blue sky for three months and we've choked, described a journalist from Sydney.
The devastating fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the inhabitants themselves cope with the disaster?
Could the Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent drastic effects, as critics say?
And what about climate change will the countries have to prepare for the future?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a journalist from Sydney Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been, and they're very rare.
That's why everyone's always written about everywhere.
It's difficult for people to deal with sexual violence in our society, and how widespread it is, so they're trying to arrange it.
I don't know anyone who's been framed.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how they are often treated by police or police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who frame someone.
It's disgusting and spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the charge is fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you only help sexual rapists.
Czechia flooded buildings, families have no money to complete
Construction material prices have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got themselves into a plight.
It does not have the means to complete a family home and the banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to the prices of materials, the price of construction works is increased.
So people don't have enough money to complete any of the family homes they've already built.
In many cases, the banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely uncomfortable situations.
In a better case, people move into a built-up and unscathed home.
In the worst case, the built houses are uninhabitable and the families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and pay rent for it," says the economist, BHS Štěpán Křeček.
We'll build two or three family houses in a year, and 50 percent of it happened to us.
It's hard for us, as a construction company, to keep things contractually, even though the material has healed.
So we do without a profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Sivoň.
A lot of people are just going to have financial problems.
If they were counting on the building to make it five million, now it's going to cost seven.
I think some of them will wait," Slivoň said.
From the material, copper, iron, as well as plumber and heating equipment were most undermined.
Construction companies are also struggling with labour shortages.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of graduates in construction and foreign workers' inflows are holding a pandemic.
At this point, only the situation regarding the issue of building permits is more favourable.
“In October, construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” Křeček said.
We're gonna get better.
Real visions are missing, says commentator of the Czech Republic – myRodlas
In addition to classical celebrations, the entrance to the new year has traditionally been accompanied by politicians.
In addition to the Prime Minister and President Andrei Babiš and the Christmas message of President Milos Zeman and the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, this year they spoke to the people.
What crucial information have we learned?
Like, I think I've got a great diploma right now, I've got my own theme that I choose, I follow up on the bachelorette, I always work on it all year long, and then I write down a written piece in a week or two.
The county's perfectly cool with us, if there's no total macaque, and there's something left in his head, then the commission won't give him unnecessary suffocation on his theory.
I mean, I've been studying in the state hall for a week, and when I was at the end of the day, the committee always tried to guide me into some logical derivative that worked out right away, and I was right.
Otherwise, I know people who will pay someone to do the semester project (we've done it many times, really beneficial, a lot of lessons) and then they just learn the project and they've got it worked out.
I think it's great when at the end of the course there's a test that reveals the knowledge gained in the project, not just the defense.
But don't jam all your emails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same prick they are.
Those people at the embassy don't have anything to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they'd risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of teddy bear Pú.
Maybe you should just put her in a way that makes Xi Jinping or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws artists under their feet.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture will be reduced to a total minimum.
In addition, it still changes what function it is more important if the counter, comment or save.
I've been so pissed off lately, so I might have to drop to tictose where a lot of artists from my business are successful and they're barely gonna let it happen.
In the end, I might even like to see something more user-friendly that doesn't suck out of artists all creativity and energy.
Declaration by the Parties working on Donbase
The union – yes, the break – no, they express their view of the opponents of the SSR.
Thirty years from the illegal crash of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history has occurred.
In the Běvěžský forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevich, without any legal authority and breach of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "The Union of the SS as an international legal entity and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
One cut of the pen "disrupted" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens were abroad.
Since the early 1990 ’ s, Russia’s population has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet Republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people who had destroyed what was built in the last seventy years for one session in the Bialyst Forest betrayed the socialist camp (made by the price of millions of lives in World War II and the Great patriotic War).
They have knowingly carried out deindustrialization, braked agriculture, removed 14 republics from the world's greatest power, which were previously economically connected in a single mechanism.
If we want to look deeper, then we see the decline of the population, the decline of the economy, science, the army, the increase of crime, the interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of geopolitical surrender, giving up the first socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such an idea in political science as "the vacuum of power".
Everything that was betrayed and married in a hurry was quickly filled and captured by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken today mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it, put it in the fridge, and make it Thursday dinner.
In an alternate reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, it will be on Tuesday's chain discounted to 99 CZK / kg - describe to me the mechanism by which this meat changes its price becomes a burden for my digestive system?
Or I wait until Thursday and the meat will be 1 day before the date of consumption discounted to 69 CZK / kg - what would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer it myself - nothing.
This bullshit about when something's cheap, it must be guaranteed bad, corrupt, or poor, they're so retarded to tell you the truth.
Now, I've been going to Brno recently and there's a brochure in the attic of the ladies, I always take things like this to help the brigades, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I thought it would be some sort of agit.
After reading, I found out who was issuing it, and eventually it came out of scientology.
Well, like, it was a good stuff, full of useless tricks, like washing and not being a pussy.
It's a waste of paper, that's why the rainforests wouldn't have to pay off.
I've had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional extortion make you satisfy this person because you like him without realizing how much he is in the [bleep] situation.
She threatened to hurt me a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried, and she begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
Cca year was a great relationship, but then another six months went by, and she started snooping on her head.
Then I ended the relationship with her from telling her I was breaking up, and I lied to her about it, but we can talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch up with any more amok.
Such a man drains your feelings, emotions and overall joy.
You'd better keep your distance.
When the insurance companies are being robbed, they're buying a cloud test, and they're chasing positives who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we're achieving is complications for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in a random number generator have fallen five days of house arrest.
In the west, they stopped the clown and recognized that there was no point in dealing with a disease weaker than that famous flu.
Unfortunately, the roller is new, and they have to steal something else and drive the ego by making up wankers.
I see we've got a good old-fashioned bastard coming back.
After several years of dampening and suppressing this unfair business, the MLM recruiting returns to the sun.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at the U.S.), initial promises about product training and business skills quickly swirled into "you don't need to care, mainly get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but training was more of a way to scare and talk.
When the first money made came in, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to pick up some certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, so that man felt like a lowlife pot dealer.
But what I can say is, it was a valuable experience, and one has learned not to jump right on every tip and check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw everyone in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not be praised by expensive consumer goods or by a "fat" account.
I've never seen much of this in a corporate store.
HR's cool, managers are looking at their management, and they're not sticking our noses into anything.
Regular evaluation is happening, in the form of what it's going like for us (set some targets for the next year, look what's come out and what's not) - it's self-assessment rather than that someone evaluates you according to some numbers, and so on.
The company's actions also optional.
But we're also a little unique within our company - there's a department that's more "corporate".
Sometimes you feel like we're such a nearly-starter that's squatting in the offices of a big corporate company.
But it doesn't work that way as long as the results are.
Czechs missing in Britain are dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police were searching for the missing 32-year-old Czech Republic, which was lost in the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in the demise of Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that the woman from Uherskohradištska was found dead.
Unfortunately, this afternoon, the British police confirmed that they had found the body of missing Czech citizens.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not be sharing more information on the case.
My condolences, he said on Twitter Kulhánek.
The young woman was last seen on 28 November on a bus on her way out of work, and she was supposed to pick up the cash from the ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by her work colleagues five days later.
After that, the London police began looking for her, Interpol classified her as missing people all over the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police have already arrested one man in this context a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspected, but she didn't make it public.
In four municipalities, at the end of the year, they allocated a new representative office.
On Saturday 11 December, in the villages Komňa, Uherskohradiště, Lužice na Mostecka, Nová Ves na Liberecku and Rovná na Pelhřimov, a new representative office was elected.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law established number or the elected council has broken down here.
The 28 mandates included 99 valid candidates in the new elections.
The vote was 62.41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62 % of the eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men have won the Mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidates have been registered for the new elections in the four municipalities.
The 28 representative posts included 36 women and 63 men.
The median age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The process of Saturday's election results is symbolically closing down a rather demanding but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very followed elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
Most of the time, we had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 hours.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the entire pandemic.
It took me a while to cope with the fact that we have a very dangerous infectious disease here, but it went without any major troubles.
Dealing with how idiotically a large part of the population is on all its layers, I have a problem with that until now.
I look forward to vaccination (tomorrow!) because he finally makes me less dependent on the fact that other people aren't shit.
The President's office would be dismissed and the ability to re-acquisition it.
The chances of this happening are, however, how the others here mention a very small one.
Besides, I'm not sure if a carded file could be considered treason at all.
The treason is an act that threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic nature of the state.
It must have been more serious.
How the pandemic influenced intimate life: A growing number of people up to 35 years old who are without sex all year round
More and more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
These are mainly religiously based people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of younger 35 people who break up sexual life rose from eight to 21 percent.
A woman between 18 and 35 years who said that they had not had sex in the last year is more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decrease in the number of sexually active individuals, as shown by the survey of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic effects of the coronavir pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But it could also contribute to the presence of media, social networks or video games that make sex less and less a priority for young people.
"The proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age has been growing rapidly since 2010, which states that they did not have sex in the previous year," said IFS Lyman Stone researcher.
In married people, sexual activity is more common, only 5% of them reported that they were without sex in 2021.
In single people, it was 29%, and Stone added that marriage under 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contribute to the loss of sexual activity.
Although it is more likely for husbands to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married younger than 35 years is still falling.
Young people think they're having premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that single individuals in this age group are a minority, but their behavior moves this trend," Stone talks about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital relations, the reason for religious establishment is that of a religious person.
Since 2008, the ratio of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60% in free people under 35 years of age who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less believers" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," said Stone.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and, above all, less social drinking during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is less likely in people without work, or with lower income.
Another reason for this is the expansion of digital media, which is likely to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus replacing this need.
This trend was taken mainly by lockdown at the time of the coronavir pandemic.
The whole order of vaccination against covid is whether society should force some of the population to behave that they don't want, but which can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question that I am most interested in personally in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question is whether if we don't order them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we would certainly not have heard any misinformation for the death of an 80-year-old who didn't know much, we didn't explain it well, heard any disinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually he caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are responsible for the death of a hardened anti-vaccination opponent, who, by the side of the SPD and the C.E.C.S., is making a noise about the bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly imported that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the other group, so they will actually be able to do so themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign for a dry fight?
This year's winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snow fairs in the last few years.
The ski resort operators are not fit without technical snow, the weather makes it difficult even to prepare the ski resort Jizerské Jizerské 50ky.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight the dry in the Czech Republic?
There's one story I should have, but it's not about the pansies.
One day in high school, the teacher led us across the city to the shipyard so that we could take a boat down the river.
On the way there we went one of these quite wide streets and who we don't see in the middle - the supporters of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but with a friend, they got into a lot of talk.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the yard.
We're so spoiled.
It's not that much, but the system is already falling apart, says Orozovič
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honours.
“We are opening a new chapter on mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border is, according to the Chancellor, appropriate to deal with diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normanda Group", bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that the Chancellor had informed about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially caused the migration crisis and used people as live targets and weapons, because we record a hundred attempts every night about (illegal) crossing the border.
The Chancellor was dealing with other sanctions so that Lukashenko's regime and his patrons in Kremlin finally understood that we were determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz, according to the DPA, assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhuman treatment of Lukashenko's regime with runners.
Drunk Polish mercenary caused an accident, tried to cover it up.
After a while, the car returned to the scene, but the car was driving another nun who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that even so, she could lose her driver's license for not giving privileges and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, said the TVN24 station.
She admitted she hit another nun in the vehicle who asked for her help.
Then the police came for Celestine's sister.
She was subjected to a breath test and immediately received her driver's license after she was found to have been in her blood for over two minutes.
At the same time, she was told that she would testify in court.
Hugo's dog is doing his best.
Juraj Shaymovich didn't watch his film.
Czech family comedists have seen in American stories about dog sweethearts.
But they forgot about the essential thing: the lawfulness of the film craft.
After a chic film by F. Brabce Gump - a dog that taught people to live, there's another film missing here about the viewery emotions in the cinemas.
The co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovic ml. freely follows his previous film Here I am watching from 2012.
There's a talking Badger Hugo and some famous characters coming back around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guesthouse, which is dying, will thus begin to invite the dogging, Julia's father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronica.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences first love.
The director and partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also a film producer) have been struggling with the process of telling already in the previous film, but there they entertained at least children and dogs.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker scenario that causes a mixture of amazement and a feeling of embarrassingness.
Let's get this over with.
Julie, although a scientist, is in the desire for a child of darkness delusions, and if the right “constation” comes, copulates with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever he determines the coordinates – on the hood of a car or church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with a local guide), the well-deserved Colonel Mojmír will, despite the years of training, shoot his own daughter (Julia), who will fall into a coma, before the family is taken away from the hospital so that the miracle process of dog healing can occur in the heart of Sumava.
Nothing against the purgatory treatment of nature and the power of animal honeys.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer wonders what a pelmel of content filled with unbelieving situations and figures was needed for this message.
Two thieves from the staff, a dog competition, a shumava charlatan, cops coming to the house to search for "drugs" and discussing herbs about the fertiliser power of bone meal – and which a roasted family in the guest house of course drinks.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and then sits on the naked and painted with a cigar at the family table and demands his father's whisky and flats as a cured vegetarian, it can't be laughed.
On top of the viewer, the creators will explain that “this sometimes happens after a coma”.
Sajmovich's team lacks basic dramatic knowledge of work with text, ability to build up a carrier situation, a sense of character and point and directorial leadership.
The acting performances are unbalanced, cut helpless and overall impressioned.
While Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová are trying to stop their party, they do not have much to play.
The only place behind the film is the poetic images of the Sumava nature of cameraman Vladimír Holomek and the pair of Badgers.
It is not enough to draw a few characters, a chatty plot and a dog's catchphrase, let alone the more populous vulgar expressions that the characters commit themselves to.
The argument is not even the age-old membership at the Jezews Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions of promoting the nature and friendship of a man with a dog, there must be knowledge of a craft if you want to tell a story of faith.
That didn't work in this case.
There's a little too much erotic for a good family film and a little bit too much feeling for the genre.
Even as an ad for canistherapy, this amateur piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they've got to listen to constant swearings just like you.
There's a difference between offering and coercion, here's where you see how shit you understand, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always on the client, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you'd been listening to a kid like that all the time, maybe you'd change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which case a brigade for earnings.
The Middle East suffers unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time in the year when it rains.
“A little complete absence of precipitation during November, as recorded at some stations, is unusual,” confirms Israel’s meteorological service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term precipitation average in November.
The two-day rain this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
Also, it's the right Christmas set, rejoicing with the inhabitants of Nazareth by Wass Askar.
The rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, are bumpy and irregular.
In the winter rains there are addicted forests.
Without them, they're dries and they're prone to fires.
It is not only about the forests, it is also about the supply of drinking water and the gulf for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Galilean lake, this spring this year, thanks to the last three rainy winters, was filled on the edge.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
Watermen warned about the drought a long time ago.
"It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may be reduced," said Ms Uri Schor, spokesperson of the Israeli Water Management Authority in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination or recycling of waste water.
The worse there are economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there are increasing tankers.
Water pipes and private wells dry up.
“This year, my orders increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years,” reported the driver of the tanker’s car Imád Sulejman in September.
There have been clashes between farmers and the security forces in Iran’s Isfahan.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The river was completely waterless.
The region has completed its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
The Israeli Defense Minister stated that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of the preparations for the attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, says Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the U.S., is trying to convince Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but also to inform Washington about military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and the world powers "they understand that the Iranians are messing with them".
This happened to me about three years ago.
I've been hopping a lady a little and grilling in an interview to find out what she wanted from me.
In the end, I found that my suspicion of pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, so I was just passing through the doubts and the questions for a little while and finally thanking and leaving.
You can tell me I'm a bastard, but the pyramid is a pyramid and the financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, they were waiting for plenty of snow and nice weather
On this weekend, the ski resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major pressure of skiers.
After a strong snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow, and some skiers started operating through it.
It did not dissuade the skier from showing its obligation to carry out a crew certificate.
While tolerators do not complain about customers’ concerns, some ski rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
On the weekend, thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to crossroads and downhills.
Skiers wished for the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are happy, the opening weekend really came from Friday night skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill,” praised Ještěd’s director of the sport area Ještěd Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went for their first weekend skiing in the new season also to Jeseníky.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the Branné resort in Šumpersko had been opened.
The weekend attendance was very good, on Saturday and today it was estimated 400 people.
The terms are cool.
Today the sun was shining, it was about a minus three degrees, so the perfect, did not spare the praised representative of the ski resort in Branné Rostislav Procházka.
Skiareal operators can only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or are within the time limit of having a covid-19 disease.
Except for the exceptions, people are prepared for this and show the necessary documents, said the CTK René Hroš from the ski center Špindlerův Mlýn.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski rentals and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, there is an interest in renting skis.
It's not like in the past years, but there's still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokiš from the Opava Skiopava store.
It is expected that the intensity will be higher in the skiing course period.
Also, the manager of Snowbear David Shinták’s Royal Garden Company feels that it is not as interested in renting ski equipment as it was before because of the covid.
By the time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
Unlike the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, said the Šinták CTK.
He thought people were lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded in the Novako area on God’s Gift.
With the ski rental there they started a week ago and the visitors must now order them in advance.
“We are starting to rent this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a great deal of interest, just like last year,” said the operator of Pavlína Nováková.
In her view, the interest of the period before the epidemic is also comparable to that of a ski school.
If we want successful and rich people not to go abroad, we must be able to live a quality life as abroad.
This is certainly not the case with socialist health, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and chic people who don't have any property are going abroad.
The owner of the company doesn't just leave.
But with the rest, I totally agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have the vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began by winning Orbán one beautiful day, the year ruled, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few dozen thousand.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is an election at all.
If you live stupidly here, you can also win some traditional V4 freak.
The young and educated will leave, and his supporters will remain, and the people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic he was in full swing of autumn, in Thailand the crew of the film Island led by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
On social networks, the actor published a bloody picture of his faces.
Is this a real injury, or is this about the screening for the shooting?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech Republic.
She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior at all and we are beginning to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district where Srncová worked.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is very concerned about her, and she simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her missing Czech Republic, on Sunday, November 28 around 19:45 she left work and headed home to the Camberwell district.
The last time she was seen on the bus was about half an hour later.
Her disappearance reported on December 3 one of her coworkers.
Srncová, according to the British media, acted as a “assist of nurses” at Evelina London Children’s Hospital, which belongs to the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," said the medical care group in twitter's contribution.
“We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that might help find her to contact the police,” the message continued.
The public also calls on Mrs Harriet Harman to cooperate, who referred to the Srnc case on Saturday at the press conference.
“She has been missing for a few days, she is only 32 years old, her parents are, of course, alarmed to death,” said the Labourist politician, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was outside her home country, away from her family and worked here for our health care," Harman said.
The police have already arrested one man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC's intelligence website, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what a man is suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
That's not how I underestimate Ukraine.
That's not a giant amount, but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are putting the threat of the Invasion on top and starting to have our entry full teeth.
I quoted it upstairs.
I don't know what he thought Russia wanted war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has GDP in Italy.
Comparing with the situation in 38 is so far out of the question that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare that with the first Punese War and the "anexia" sílie :D
I can imagine that, after Ukraine has announced that it is not going to comply with the Minsk Agreement, Russia is advocating those ridiculous republics.
That's it, and that's what the concentration on the border would have been like.
Ona, the pacta sunt servadda...
New timetables have been in force in Prague since Sunday, especially for suburban connections
Travellers in Prague's Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting since Sunday for a number of changes that concern mostly suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslav is now involved in the integrated system.
In the capital since Sunday there are fasts from České Budějovice in the station Garden Town.
In suburban train transport, S7 trains will take the route from Beroun to Česká Brod by the main railway station in Prague.
In the recently established station Prague-Zahradní Město will now stop the R17 from České Budějovice and Benesova.
PID is now expanding to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna near Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be included in Mladoboleslav region, including lines with a crossover to Liberec and the Králové Region.
With integration 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be modified.
From Prague Zličín there will be a new bus line 405, which will go all the way to Žatka.
There is also a new direct connection Prague-Kralovice near Rakník, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
They will be strengthened in the morning tip and on the weekend of the connection from Prague to Rakovník, when the express line 404 will start.
Newly, the PID system includes lines 400 and 410 travelling to the Liberec Region.
They are starting from Střížkov Metro Station, not from Nádraží Holešovice Station.
The backline 400 goes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lipa to Nowy Boru and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou do Doks, Mimona and Jablonny in Podještěd.
On the contrary, a new operation is cancelled or limited on ten central Czech local lines, including Mochov, Dobřiš or Rožmital, under Třemšín.
All trains depart from Prague at 02:30.
Due to the modernization of the railway, the long-term restrictions on the Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín continue.
Changes are waiting for passengers in other places as well.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or expand the section on line 420 from Dobřeš followed by Prague, where you can use PID tickets up to Milevska.
The changes have been made by lines 540 to 543 in Nymbursk and the routes of some buses at the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region are adjusted.
Healthy snacks/dinners from the supermarket office
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only way to get food is to go next to Billy or go to Lidlu.
Since I don't have any movement, after work I don't have the strength to train, I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'm going to buy the maximum speed pizza cream and yogurt and apple snacks.
Question: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend to me in the supermarket?
Not everyone's waiting for a meter of snow like you, that's the way it is.
And it's not the trees you need to see.
Only a tip of a tree can hide under the snow.
If it rots, the tree can be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're not allowed to ride off the slopes, but it's one of them.
The gift's confession about a relationship with Nes Consciousness: I wasn't looking forward to this.
Czech show business pond since Friday has lived nothing other than by revealing the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Ned.
They've been pulling it together for years, the famous footballer even got a divorce for a singer.
The gift has now sent a comprehensive message to the fans, explaining why love had been hidden from them for half a year.
"I am pleased to claim that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia who would have escaped that Dara caught a bear, i.e. an apology, a Nejvice," jokes Dar Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew that this would happen once, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse than that.
Whether those who are not interested in it, and it comes at them from the canned or from us, whose lives they spend in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or your girlfriend fit well enough, or insisted that everyone really knew in detail the list of your former partners and were familiar with your mistakes and mistakes.
That's a hog, that's what you want, Dara.
The couple came together in Italy, where Roles went to prepare her new fashion collection.
The bear has long been a vice president of the Juventus Football Club.
They went out with the truth now because they were waiting for Ned's divorce to end.
They've been separated for three years with Ian's wife, but they've only been married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish, thank you.
We are just people, we have families, children, the past, and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man, and like him, I stand by him. In good and bad, Roles closed.
Hey, the other commentaries probably already said everything, just confirming that the colleges are cool until the start, my classmates usually met each other during the first semester or two, and they got to know each other, and then they found subsidies together, which makes me feel like the best option, because you know who you're gonna live with.
Most of the apartments don't advertise much in advance, so you probably won't be able to find much right now, but I'm sure looking at the offer won't hurt.
Otherwise, avoid not only Cejla, but also the surroundings (street streets like Vranov, French etc., it is a bad address), and some parts of the Jewish are a bit ghettoo.
On the other hand, the Vever district is a lot of student, the King's field and so it's nice, in addition it's close to most of the BUT faculty (I don't know exactly where you're going).
I've never been looking for rent, but I'm native Brno, so maybe I can advise with Brno as if you were missing any more information :)
But that's an example of "normal" thinking.
In fact, because of what several doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is quite okay that the state does not finance certain schools.
Whether they learn what they want and pay for it in their own way or whether they go according to the state and pay the state.
After all, we can't let a private actor control a piece of education just because he's going to throw a few crowns into a full state contribution and he's going to be able to teach himself what he wants in schools.
Such a claim loses weight when it was written by a person who spoke this way two days earlier about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So the voice against if anyone's going to an abortion is the same as the voice against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the guy who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced that (including long-term professionals) it's either going to throw it from the eye, or write something on the way xxx *** or ... (in addition to the convention) and the note that it's not readable.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it at all.
Personally, I'd be able to deal with it in some way, depending on what kind of program you're using.
If you want to be a good student, you can look in some sign databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing on a book, I'd guess the author or the printer simply created his own character that fits into what's physically on the coin.
PS: Is it by chance more Odry Empire than OdryN?
PSS: Someone's already cracked your place.
Look at this comment with  would you like to comment on this comment?
Politicians have no idea what will be the theme of our Presidency.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve of something because no one understood a text is smiling.
All the important documents approved are examined by word, and no basic knowledge of English is enough anyway, that's a matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in different EU institutions, English is more suited for informal relations, establishing superstandard relationships.
Moreover, with English it is quite interesting, after the speech of the GB from the EU.
I don't get the Hate on Ceyl.
I've been working there for the third year and I'm fine.
How many times do I drive from work at 10 o'clock and never a problem?
That it's a ghetto that can only say someone who hasn't stepped in.
Yeah, there's probably most of the Roma population in Brno, but all they do is get in the way of the pavement and parks where they don't have :D is definitely not that I'm afraid to climb up the street there tonight.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access downtown, I'd go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) Without Dáda and mistress Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who's she going to spend Christmas with?
On Sunday most people on the adventure wreath lit the first candle, Felix Slováček not.
I don't have an adventure wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen Dady wreath, and I'm sure Lucie has one, too, said the lightning saxophonist, who so confirmed Patras' words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada remained alone after his departure.
Slovak still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix, and both our grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem: Come together!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem.
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I'm buying gifts on a continuous basis, and I'm sure Dad and Lucia can buy me something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who came to the baptism of the music video to the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet the wife of Luďka Sobota Adriana or the singer Kamila Nývlt.
And he made it very clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us and our location is strategic enough that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot to keep this territory from taking over.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know any other ingredient that could be deployed in hospitals in the crisis.
The police are few, and they can't afford it, just like the firemen and nowhere else so high a percentage of healthy people are not so trained.
And the fact that our army is able to defend it is only Ostrava who has gone to the head of previous governments, not the army, that has been asking for new toys long enough.
Record dry in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic has been going through the worst drought period in recent years.
According to scientists, there has been less precipitation in mountain and sub-mountain areas, and there are places where there has been no need for weight.
The cause of the drought, which is taking place in most of Central Europe, is climate change.
But the impact also strengthens the way we manage the land.
What should I prepare for with regard to dryness?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's gonna be, I can barely hold on to ice skates, I know what hockey is, and the tactics (as I tried in the Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total haluz.
And whether you're a hockey team called "Nice Russia" or "Lam of China" so you lose two goals even if you don't have to win the game at any cost is different than when compared.
But either way, as I listen to Czech commentators who hear what the referees don't notice, whether male or female hockey, it's all weird, but it's probably all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversies are everywhere.
And the imho, if it were the opposite, it is as usual, and that the Czech Republic has already lost more often than it has won, it would probably be the classic "vons lost" vs "We have won".
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
There are 5766 people in hospitalized.
In total 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 1967 at 100 000, 871 at 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new diseases have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It's the lowest daily number since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily death rate since the end of October.
Britain faces the "inevitable" large wave of diseases caused by Omicrons, said on Sundays by Dr. Susan Hopkins, the Chief Medical Advisor for the British Health Department.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicrons are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one died of omicrons, but hospitalization takes place about 14 days after the plague and about three weeks after the plague.
The head of British Labourists Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by throwing Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December, when lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Minister of the Johnson government argued that the quiz took place "virtually" through a computer.
Of course, he was attended by a group of employees gathered around the computers on Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is increasing to remove Johnson from the Prime Minister's office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, the ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are angry that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial for Britain: Today, Boris Johnson won a vast majority in general elections two years ago.
This morning, the Conservative is talking about the need to remove him from the Prime Minister's office.
It's remarkable how quickly events evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for elections in the spring to end the 12-year reign of Viktor Orbán.
It will be a pan-European election.
How much do you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because that wasn't the last two elections under Orbán.
His side Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituency to profit from it, and makes other less or more tricks.
The last one so far is that everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesza to tie voters from determined districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they're not gonna be fair at all.
Do you think it's going to be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
But the situation is very different.
It used to be, not if Fidesz wins, but how much and if he's going to have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will gain a unified opposition.
This is for Viktor Orbán and his side is a big habit.
Won't they try to keep the power to play even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
Recently, an independent media recording by the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér, where secret service chiefs have reported that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are those the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has a long time, but then he blows extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric, and I was angry as a little awful, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in the cramp and being all blue, they took me under the shower about two times to calm down.
Sometimes I got a little wet, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I certainly have a tendency now to deal with things by violence, like a little one I've fought quite well, now I'm at least punching myself in the face of something, and as a younger person, maybe I'm just so high on my hand (so I don't get too high on my hand), so I never get anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I can't determine to what extent that's my explosive, but I'm sure that's what the education has to do with it, too.
I'm afraid I'll also lose my patience with my children and deal with it the same way.
I think it's just wrong to beat the kids and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at the time when it wasn't "stupid," but from frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just fucks up, it's probably not possible to take his kids a little time off, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't insult me, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws are supposed to be clear and clear.
I would call it Kundami those who make up laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of having an income loss?
Is it really possible to count on people wanting a product and buying it, and you'll have something to pay for it?

Where will Slovakia move the trial with the killers of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with four defendants of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She was disputing civil society, but she also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marián Kočner and his connection to the tops of Slovak politics and justice.
How significant a break will the process mean for Slovakia?
The press are responsible for this.
How is it possible that this petition had more media attention than the anti-peptics of the dean of all the medical faculties that came out a day or two later?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
Minister Havlíček's proposal needs to be reworked in principle
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of a deep storage site of high radioactive waste is still in existence.
The legislative board of the government interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government over the years.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the municipalities concerned associated with the Platform against the Deep Storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Cities of the Czech Republic.
Self-government expects from the law to strengthen its ability to decide what storage is promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which requires both the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition treaty, to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Havlíček, who has the Platform at his disposal, urges the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of the site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all.
This can be ensured by the imposition of the obligation of the Storage Administration to request prior to the initiation of a specific procedure the consent of the municipalities concerned.
The proposed draft substantive intention almost completely ignores public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically just a statistic in the authorisation procedures.
The design lacks system compensation settings for villages for the entire search and selection process for storage, its authorization and operation.
In fact, according to today's legal standards, the representatives of the municipalities do not have much opportunity to defend their citizens' interests in finding a place to store.
However, in certain tendering procedures they may submit their comments or appeal, the Office or the Minister in whose interest the authorisation is granted shall decide.
Where appropriate, the action shall not have a suspensive effect on the carrying out of reconnaissance or construction work.
Together with the self-government that the Platform requests, the principle is commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those where they have already advanced in allowing storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
Furthermore, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o. concluded by SURAO and related to contracts with lawyer Jane Zemanek.
According to the register, the total sum for these works is almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, village mayor of Cejle from Hrádek locality and spokesperson of the Platform against deep storage said: After the ministers of industry, who settled the position of self-government with the state authorities in searching for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste, we are waiting for a more significant turnover from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Cities, who sees the issue of the lack of rights of municipalities in such essential buildings in the same way as the municipality in the selected localities directly concerned.
The deep-sea storage platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state’s access to spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste that will not be limited to deep storage.
The Platform further advocates that the decision to select a site for possible storage should be conditional upon the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
The actor John Goodman (69) forced weight loss to fear: He threw 90 kg.
Although in his lifestyle he had no need to change anything for many years, the doctors eventually scared him.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new character in Los Angeles during the premiere of the animated series "Freak Brothers".
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke about his friends and family begging him to lose weight because his big body caused the furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," said the actor in 2018 in an interview for AARP.
This time, I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, practice.
I get to the age when I can no longer afford to sit on the spot, he said for ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss and what kind of "boss" you want to use.
If this is about some text on a platform that expects readers from a game environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, a formal text and maybe a college text, I'd probably be looking for a boss to describe or explain.
There's more bosses for everything.
Like a game like Dark Souls, etc. has bosses a few, yeah, and so "boss" is like a master / ruler given level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who are not at all needed to beat the game or level to be completed, but often are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then you need games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't get straight with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and you can call them anything at all?
And then there are mini bosses.
In a way, it is simply impossible to translate the boss, the Czech and the other languages do not solve it (an interesting one is only Catalan, which the bosses translate as the final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game of generally significant, computer controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and watchful completion of some level or task.
The missing Peter from London is looking for the whole world.
Czech police have also been involved.
The missing Petra Srncová has been searching for the British police since December 3rd.
Czech police were involved in the search.
That 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště's been looking for her since December 7.
Interpol also helps the British police.
Czechia Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow jock for her.
So Peter's looking for the whole world.
“Czech police work closely with the British police,” confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendl.
"We share information on the case," she added.
The reported search for Petra has already appeared on the police site.
According to him, it's 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman was involved in the search for Petra.
She's involved in hanging out flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, the British police have already arrested one suspect.
But it's not clear who he was and what he had in common with Petra.
The pre-night Czech Republic is terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decline in the attacking campaigns last month, attacks significantly increased with the approaching end of the year.
We recorded a big campaign with Agent Tesla on November 18.
Attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attack strategy has remained the same for the time being.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is intended to draw attention to the name that refers to payments and financial transactions in the user.
While last month had a dangerous attachment in the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a Copy to repair the receipt for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan web browsers and other programs such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
Harmful code actively searches for stored log-in data which then sends them to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the upcoming holidays and the activity of the attackers is growing again at the end of the year.
In November he remained active and spyware Formbook.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically focus on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November have captured campaigns with global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but still stands for almost five of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook contains the most common Annex to the .exe file, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIAL.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
The annex in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
The security analysts on the Fareit program, which has been behind 1.6 percent of the attacks and in the Czech Republic, have not had any major offensive campaign in recent months.

The Prague Guide was bigger than the media say.
According to the photos of the waterfront parade, and in my experience, the protestor is not afraid of an estimated 10,000 people.
People in the parade filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite coastal communication.
That means a lot of people.
Some four-thousand demonstrators are spontaneously added to the parade by an unprecedented number of passers.
I'm saying there's something new here, Radek Wetý writes.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population has led them to find common ground.
Only the anti-vaxers, the anti-robustrators and the spol. would not be able to fill this great parade or pay.
The events of the Chípl dog have rising popularity, it reminds me of a million moments for democracy on the inside.
Sometimes I feel like they're renting the same stage and technology.
It's hard to say what movement could be paid out of this dissatisfaction, not only does it depend on the cash flow, but also on whether a three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not become a square and more dose.
It's definitely not a left or center movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The genius of scientists, for which mankind is rightly proud.

From "secret" shots taken, there is a global hit.
During the weekend, concerns about the fate of 32-year-old Czechs were increasing in Britain, which has been searching for by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she went home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
For information about the child's hospital's worker, she is calling, among other things, her current employer or Member representing part of London, where she lived.
"The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior at all and we are beginning to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district where Srncová worked.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is very concerned about her, and she simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her missing Czech Republic, on Sunday, November 28 around 19:45 she left work and headed home to the Camberwell district.
The last time she was seen on the bus was about half an hour later.
Her disappearance reported on December 3 one of her coworkers.

“We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that might help find her to contact the police,” the message continued.
