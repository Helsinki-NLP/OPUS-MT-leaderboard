A black box in your car?
While American road designers are working hard to find money to repair the decomposing highway network, many begin to see solutions in a small black box that easily fit into your car's instrument board.
A device that tracks every kilometre that the motorist runs off and transfers this information to the authorities is at the heart of the controversial efforts of Washington and the state planning authorities to renew the outdated system of financing US main roads.
Usually, the construction of motorways suddenly stimulated intense debate and the creation of various associations.
Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbyed for the government to use these small lockers that would record the miles and maybe where you're going – and then use this information to build a tax burden.
Tea's party is horrified.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of problems with protecting privacy.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.
They shall determine how they can move over the next decade to the system where the driver pays for the kilometres of the road on which he is driving.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black lockers, some of which have GPS surveillance, to test.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“This is not a matter where we can choose,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Southern California State Administration Association, who is planning to start monitoring the miles off at every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for it.
The point is that the Road Trust Fund financed by the taxes paid by the Americans at the gas stations is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Automobiles go a lot more miles per gallon.
Federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Because of the current high fuel price, politicians are reluctant to raise their taxes by just one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this payment system for a kilometre.
"In the long run, this seems the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of miles left.
It is no surprise that this idea likes urban liberals, because taxes can be used to change driver behaviour patterns, for example, which can help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gases.
California’s projectors are looking at this system when planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (Representative of Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Committee on Transport, said he also saw this as the most functional long-term alternative.
The representatives of the Free Market from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for the miles.
“It is not a tax that disappears in the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of the strategy in the Reason organization.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in 2011 invited Congress to go towards paying per kilometre.
The US Senate approved the pilot project for USD 90 million last year, which was intended to cover about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing residents, whose daily life often means insulting many kilometres for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The most aggressive is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the tax for the miles, instead of the gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is investigating the project right now.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in trucks.
A coalition I-95, which includes 17 state transport departments, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept is not just a supporter.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers’ cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned by the government’s ability to monitor their movements.
“Fears related to watching Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who runs strategy and operation management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to transform these devices into a full tracker.”
There is no need to build a huge, heavy technological infrastructure that will inevitably extend to the register of daily trips and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few countries that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometres the car will find, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do it, Khan said, the public will be more calm.
He led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (actual distance).
This company was originally not involved in an action to assist the government in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging insurance market with legal liability, where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they screwed up.
But this device, which is testing, attracts attention to road network designers because it does not use GPS and supplies only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using modems.
"People will be more willing to do this if you do not follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, there have been a number of big mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a GPS device or no GPS.
Or they don't have to take any facilities, and instead they decide to pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of miles of all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places, they hope that the prudent public will proceed to this concept if the device can do more, no less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would have been equipped so that parking hours can be charged to provide insurance by miles and collect data on the speed of other drivers so that motorists can avoid traffic congestion.
“Motors will be willing to take part in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them,” reports the city’s projection document.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussions about paying for a kilometer are not just a major substitute problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Committee on San Francisco Bay Transport say that Congress could solve the problem with the bankrupt Road Trust Fund very simply by increasing the gas tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not need a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for any radical operation when it is enough to take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Committee on Legislative Affairs and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
Sobotka is negotiating for the ČSSD.
Social democracy is drool, people and grandmothers are talking and preparing a common course.
If the social democrats get tired within a few weeks, they will sit on the negotiating table with perfectly matched partners who will place a finished list of requirements on the table, including ministerial posts.
The citizens of ČSSD then either swallow sour coalition grapes or nod to the drilling minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka first crashed after four days of sympathizing on the wave.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political gremium and, above all, to force the convicted liar to resign.
The confirmed negotiating party is only he, the other members of the team will be allowed after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CVC).
I apologized to the members of the gremium and now to the citizens.
Not to lie, not in personal life, not in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hasek said after the negotiations of the narrowest management of social democracy.
He added that the first Vice-Chairman did not lie at the post.
"I will communicate my decision to the HVV on 10 November," He said.
In the same way, Vice-President Zdeněk Škromach and Head of the Jeroný Tejc Chamber of Deputies spoke.
However, he pointed out that he was elected only two days ago.
Both Members then declared that they would do everything they could to make the ČSSD's 50-members sound with one voice.
Michal Hasek, a member of the ČSSD for 15 years, has always been loyal to her mark and I have respected the decisions of the party authorities.
They made another lie in direct transmission.
Or perhaps in an invitation to the Sobotk resignation and its elimination from the negotiating team, he forgot that the August H.V.V. had made 57 per cent of the decision that Bohuslav Sobotka was a candidate for the Prime Minister's party?
The chief of the ČSSD, however, produced powerful armies of enemies by convening the H.V.A. until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with all sorts of gossip and rumours, eventually reminded the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
There will be a powerful beating of dirty laundry, signs of dark alliances between Zdenek Bakala and Sobotka's wing will appear.
He will discuss Bohuslav Sobotka's friendly relationship with Radek Pokorný.
There are disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the ČSSD.
Warning are the words of the Ostrava Mayor and Sobotkov's ally Peter Kajnar: "I signed Chartu 77 so the idiots don't rule the country."
If the UVC had already met this weekend, liars would probably have been forced to sacrifice their functions ritualically.
The traitors will lay their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning boss of the ČSSD then ends with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on OH problems in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is difficult
The balls of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he takes a deep breath, "It's difficult."
Cooperation with the organizational team of the Olympics in Sochi 2014 is a little more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget what was at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic Mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower than that.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of providing information on the essentials, not so much.
For three months we've been hopping them to give us how the villages will be officially marked, so that we can do a whole lot of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating that thing.
They still communicate in a number of things.
Is there at least a complete Olympic village?
But it's not a disaster anymore.
We walked in empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean that they're empty?
Are there any ready-to-be floors?
Only the basic concrete, that was the condition a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we arrive on January 26th, as a premier, it will still smell glue.
And if they don't make it, what will be?
President Putin would you think he'd catch an army there?
That's exactly what's gonna happen.
Just so it's not that the Olympic village = the Tumkin village.
Rather, they may not be able to manage their journeys, for example, to finish their details.
Maybe they'll have paths in such a state that we'll have to bring in the dolls from the London games.
But I believe they'll put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now it's about 78, although depending on the nomination criteria, it's changing the number.
Like the skaters are probably going to go in the trio they've left.
Also, no one has to doubt Martina Sáblíková about the fast skater, but otherwise it's in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should be there on January 26th.
What houses will look like in the Olympic village, we know.
We even measured some things ourselves on the subway so we wouldn't believe only the sketches.
We are also preparing many other things, including transport.
And what does the Head of Mission do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I'm preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I'm making a common agenda in terms of communication with the Organising Committee in Sochi.
Putin promised him an ecological Olympics, a plan to catch a giant secret dump.
Fans of winter sports have already cut the meter until the opening of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are looking at their preparation with increasing concerns.
The Russian Olympics, although not until February, are struggling with another scandal.
The Russians seem to be failing to fulfill the promise that the preparation and conduct of games will not, in the least, disturb the nature of the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be headed in four months.
In the end, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high bar built, and Canadian games have signed up for the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that President Vladimir Putin's commitment to organize games with "zero waste" seems to have taken a long time on his own.
Reporters of the AP agency discovered a giant landfill of building material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi last week.
So a dump full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulating foam was found by environmentalists in August, which was reported immediately.
The Russian authorities have disappeared and the landfill has disappeared.
Just for a little while.
Last week, reporters came across a dump of three football pitches.
It is not the only place in which several were created, described the British newspaper The Times.
There are Russian railways, state monopoly, which builds an approximately 60-mile route between Sochi airport and the sports resort.
A company that already swallowed 280 billion rubles led one of Putin's close associates Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railroads fought back that one of the subcontractors founded the dump.
But the locals are desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village for three months and nights.
According to experts, the waste is likely to contaminate the local river Mzymtu, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates the Sochoic water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," said Vladimir Kimajev of the environmental non-profit organization EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organisational committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison: the game in Sochi will cost $51 billion, while the summer Olympics in Beijing 2008 went out to 43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost only 19 billion and that vancouverian nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays, and worry if there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected during the exhibition of sports and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers put his mouth in protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers have dealt with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during their games.
Some visitors are about to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple matured to living with their parents, the new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given as a commission to design a house on a plot which lies on the corner of two streets, while the property itself is somewhat considering.
It was further in demand that two generations would live together in the house, but each should have its own clear space.
The younger couple needed an extra small office.
The house is located on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping property.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"We respected family connections, history and memories linked to the place."
"Three different functions of the house are connected through several routes through the exterior of the object, so everyone realizes the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explained.
Parents' home is at the garden level with an old pine tree that binds to family traditions and memories.
The individual parts of the house are easily identifiable from the outside, because they differ in the different final design of the facade.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been formed by boards, the part where the office is is is cast white and the remaining elements remained in the clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glassy, making the interior of the house very intertwined with the exterior.
The home of parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that has great significance for the family.
The interior connection with the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues into the living room.
Kitchen space in a young couple's household.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance to the hall and from there climb up the stairs to their space.
The stairs are the main dominant of the interior of the house.
Their design enables a lot of natural light to pass through them.
That's what architects were trying to do to distinguish the house from others and to print it something unique.
The home of the young couple is treated as one open space with kitchen parts, dining room and living room together.
It is only divided from the terrace by a glass wall with sliding doors.

The second floor is composed as one large open space that freely goes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office in the highest floor is connected in a clean combination of white and black colors.
The stairs is a dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance, find themselves in the entrance hall and then climb up the stairs.
Defend academic freedoms, that's true for Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on open letters from students, teachers and the management of secondary and university schools in several regions to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman at schools.
I met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture by the Honorary President of the SOZ - Zemanovci in the parliamentary period, even got retribution in the form of an invitation to the celebration of the Czech Republic's state holiday.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who have not been so brave and visited Milos Zeman: University of Technology in Brno, Gymnázium Hladnov in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
Now we meet in Pardubice with the continuation of policy enforcement at universities.
A newly elected MP for ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to withdraw from his academic function, and it also seems normal to him.
Professor, it's not really the same as if you'd stayed the mayor of a smaller town for example.
Do you want to join the heads of the ČSSD, who also train the position of Members and Hetman and, like them, degrade both professions?
You tell people that you can handle both these demanding functions with your left rear.
I know, we have an example here of Michal Hask, who can handle even a few dozen functions at once.
But I guess that's not exactly an example of the person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post so that she can fully devote herself to the management of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation, however, for leaving the dean's office is that you are violating the apoliticality of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current action on both posts as an advantage to the University.
But you will be able to help "your" school without being a dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion to me and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your retreats and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may find that the voters will count on you in the next election.
And that doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice, the drums don't add the chemistry to it.
More than a thousand tonnes of sour cabbage want to produce in the coming months in Slovecké Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
Season started here in October, and it will take about six months.
Healthy delicacy has been produced here since 1925 in a traditional way, i.e. by treading in big dances.
In modern industrial times, it's about rarity.
Our worker found a nearly ten-mile-mile-long route for a shift.
Each of the ten tanks will fit 15 to thirty tons of cabbage, one will take three shifts to fill," said the Director of the Slováká Fruta David Klabroba.
The cabbages are transported to the premises of the company directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrava and Břeclav.
The Fruta staff then cleans the vegetables, removes the shells and throws them into the ringer.
From there, the sliced cabbage falls into the pools at a depth of 6 meters, in which hookers dressed in white clothing and shavings work tirelessly.
That's how the unwanted air is squeezed out.
The last climbing layer of cabbage is covered with a tarpaulin and loaded with water.
"The green ring then ripens six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of acidifying agents," stressed Director Klastrob.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic conditions, individual layers of workers pour through salt and cumin.
The cabbage after fermentation goes to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweet acidic infusion into sachets or glasses and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sour cabbage primarily to the domestic and Slovak market.
It is also noted in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "co-operate" with Germany in connection with US monitoring
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence rat, announced that he was willing to leave for Berlin to provide evidence to the German Parliament unless the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are able to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed the possibility of testifying in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, a Member of the Council of Friday in Berlin, states: “While the result of my efforts has been proved positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as a fugitive and attempts to criminalise political speeches with heavy actions that do not give room for defence.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believes that the support of the international community could convince the United States government to drop the charges against him.
The charges charged by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Home Minister, said to Zeit Online: “If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to make this possible.”
The tension between the US and Germany began to rise when it was claimed that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of the Parliament who runs the parliamentary panel that oversees the intelligence, said that if there was any opportunity for Mr Snowden to be heard as a witness, "without being put at risk and completely destroying relations with the US, this should be done.
Mr Sträbele, Member of Parliament, for the German side of the Greens, published a picture of him and Mr Snowden on his Twitter contribution.
On his way to Russia he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contractor, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he had left once.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be "safe," said a member of Parliament.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he faced harsh and persistent campaigns associated with persecution that forced him to leave home.
However, he said that the reaction of the whole world to his “act of political expression ” gave him courage.
Citizens across and out of the United States, including those in the United States, assessed the disclosure of an unfounded system of universal public service monitoring.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, "until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
We're sorry to kill you, but we're innocent, the Red Khmers are defending themselves
Nuon Chea was number two in the Red Khmer hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is the former Head of State.
In the reign of the Red Khmers, which was based on a mixture of maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, they died from exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture, and execution of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the then population.
This commander of the infamous prison S-21 granted the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010 a life sentence.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are the accusations of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were defending themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interest of the nation, and they had no idea what the real extent of killing was.
"It is easy to say that I should know everything, understand everything and therefore intervene and correct the situation," said Khieu Samphan in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is, I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said that he never ordered the Red Khmers "to treat people badly or kill them to deny them food or commit genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
A five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives in the Red Khmer regime, said AFP couldn't accept the apology of Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"Only he wants to be exonerated."
"He doesn't care about others," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordination wouldn't have killed," she added that the leaders of the Red Khmers were worse than monsters.
The "minister of abroad" of the Red Khmer regime of Ieng Sara, which died this year in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, found an incompetent trial in September 2012.
The leader of the Red Khmers Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 in its years for the deposit of hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to USD 100 per hand luggage and USD 2 per coffee or soda, although in their announcement on Wednesday they said that passengers will be able to keep the whole can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so that small luggage under the seat will continue free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge 25 USD if the fee is paid in advance, and 100 USD if the passengers with the payment wait until the arrival at the gate.
Frontier Kate O'Malley, spokesperson, stated that a hundred-dollar fee was to encourage passengers to take care of the payment ahead.
"We would not like to collect this fee," she said.
Airlines started to charge the first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuff into hand luggage hidden in storage space as much as they could, so there was often no room in this space.
Fees are one of the ways to teach passengers how to take less things on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee really isn't to get more money.
The point is that Frontier's most trusted customers made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage area is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in front of Frontier's gate can bring a luggage for which nothing will pay, while the other passenger in the queue will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said that the website and check-in procedures will be adapted to ensure that passengers will know about the fee before they arrive at the gate.
The new Frontier fee for hand luggage will not be valid before summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about luggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage costs money, and the passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see an additional luggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to collect enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of loss.
But most of the charges for hand luggage did not touch.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago and another low cost company Allegiant Air followed its example later.
The only company that also has such charges is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says the air advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional charges.
In its December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage charge would bring USD 50 million per year.
Sorensen, the former head of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers met with the unusual charge of Spirit for hand luggage.
“It was the most common thing I have ever seen in my flight career,” he said.
I was expecting to see teeth and fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the entrance took place in a gutter."
The Frontier also applies coffee, tea, soda and juice fees to Spirit.
Frontier said that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be added free of charge.
The water will continue to be served free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways briefly tried to introduce charges for beverages, but after complaints by passengers seven months later, and no other major airline copied them.
The latest move by Frontier to charge hand luggage if passengers do not purchase flights directly from this airline, is its last effort to direct customers directly to their website.
Airlines are paid to online travel sellers such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, instead of doing so via online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began to give customers who bought through the Internet travel agency only half the miles under the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut her reward for a mile to 25 percent of the mile from her trip.
So moving with Frontier for a long 1000 miles through an Internet travel agency is a 250-mile reward.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if the purchase takes place directly via Frontier's website.
Frontier has a faithful customer base in her home town of Denver, but her business is beginning to shrink and lose money.
According to the financial results presented on Wednesday by Republic Airways Holdings, sales dropped by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
The Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier by selling this airline.
For the fall of the NSA website does not blame hackers, but "internal error"
The mysterious National Security Agency reported last Friday that her website for a few hours last week fell due to an internal error, not because of a hacker attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
“The NSA.gov pages were not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update,” said the spy agency in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the blackout was caused by the DDoS attack (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Previously, this evening, Internet servers sensors recorded that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the site is no longer available for some users.
In the past, NSA spokesperson ABC News reported that internal sensitive network of the Agency had not been "at last" threatened.
The spokesperson said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for eliminating the NSA pages through DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are overloaded and the site falls.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
In recent months, the former NSA's super-secret agency, once acquired a nickname No such agency, has become, after the line of disclosure of foreign and domestic tracking programs, the centre of public attention and target biteful criticism, a product of alienating NSA's secret files from the agency and their disclosure by a disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the Agency has stimulated earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of targeted cyber operations.
Bombardier’s profit fell due to a drop in supplies and orders
The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier announced on Thursday a 15 percent decrease in net profit due to a smaller number of orders and supplies of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any data on the air test for its new CSeries type, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft would comply with the ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the commencement of the test flight, about a month and a half of the plane flew only three times, and the question arises of whether the test phase is going well.
The results did not fill estimates and stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange decreased by 8 percent.
On Thursday, the bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced the credit rating from the "higher yield" to the "performance of the sector" with the expectation that the stock exchange will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While smaller aircraft supplies were largely expected, the profit margins in the field of transport have greatly disappointed us,” Doerksen said in the report to clients.
With the way the trial program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders from CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are notified in the coming months, we assume that the market will increase towards this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft collide to the bottom of the market, which now dominate Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was discovered in March and after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders made by CSeries is modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight in order to verify the company’s claims regarding low consumption and cost savings on this aircraft.
Currently there are 403 orders and liabilities from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected 300 binding orders to be reached by Bombardier when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
The leaders also assured analysts and media that the programme was progressing as planned on Thursday.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” said Beaudoin in the conference call and noted that the tests on the ground and the software updates were planned during the departure of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates and we did it.
That's what's gonna happen during the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the other shortly thereafter.
However, analysts are skeptical of the fact that the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has assessed its plan for putting the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – even though it is in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to strengthen our view that putting into operation will be moved to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to USD 147 million in the third quarter of September, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted yields per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover decreased marginally from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to the IBES, Thomson Reuters expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft producer stated that only 45 aircraft had been delivered by one year before that quarter compared to 57 aircraft.
Clean orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unful contracts in the air division were 32.9 billion at 30 September, which does not change until 31 December.
"The results in aviation were consistent with our prospects, but low order receipts and the overall state of the market failed us," said Beaudoin.
The return in the aviation industry decreased by 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest train manufacturer in the world, stated that the income in this division increased by almost 11 percent to USD 2.1 billion.
Unful contracts in transport were 32.6 billion at 30 September, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was influenced by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The leaders stated that new perspectives would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced the arrival of Google Patrick Pichette’s Financial Director, decreased by 8.5 percent during business on Thursday afternoon to a value of 4.83 USD.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest producer of commercial aircraft and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, announced on Thursday a 10% fall in quarterly profit.
A cocaine lawyer who warned the mob against a police investigation is in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to give information to the king of the underworld Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was worried that his drug addiction would come out.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A high-profile defense attorney who informed a drug mob about a major police investigation because he was afraid that his drug addiction would come out was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42), after becoming a suspect in cocaine use, had to pass sensitive information on his drug trafficking activities to the chief of the Underworld of Neil Scarbrough.
A lawyer whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was celebrated as the best lawyer was arrested in his home in 2011.
The police spotted Sarborough (32) at a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just having dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society, three cocaine bags.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During the period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried to gain information on the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were followed up at the time during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After the police arrested heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million in cash during a series of raids, another 32 people ended up in prison along with them.
Ditta (42) gave information to criminals for fear of coming to his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works with Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, experienced a shameful time before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of preventing justice in two cases after three weeks of trial.
During his earlier hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer fell after Scarborough's police investigation found that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival in Ditt's house, and saw him placing 60 percent of his drugs under his lawyer's basket in his black golf glove.
He was subsequently Scarborough with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular phone call.
The lawyer returned home where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two.
In court, there were traces of Class A drug in his hair, wallet, and his credit cards, and Ditta was the "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was arrested later, but he denied the use of cocaine, and he said that he spoke to a suspected dealer because he was his client and argued that their conversation was part of a "disclosure communication".
During his arrest, Ditt took his wallet and tried to get some credit cards out of it, but they were all arrested and his hair samples were taken.
In a police hearing, he said he had an office both at his home and at his workplace, and that he had been visited at home because of his work.
However, the Court of First Instance has heard that after the key arrests, he contacted major drug supply players, some of whom had previously been represented to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware of the fact that he must not violate the law than a lawyer in criminal law. ”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as attorney and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here isn't just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the limits of a regular lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigation has wasted as much as possible to allow them to continue their crime.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring his profession a good reputation, on the contrary, he dishonored her.
He got too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disturbed.
Ditta refused the offense and stated: “If I were a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I would like to give information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
After the hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta himself became a criminal when he started getting drugs from organised criminals. ”
His dependence on cocaine has made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading representatives of organised crime groups, which gave him the task of collecting valuable information about police investigations.
The lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and have confidence in the public and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cape of his profession.
The serious and organised crime unit in Lancashire has led to an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also sentenced for three cases of cocaine possession and now for preventing justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring criminals to trial.
This case should serve all criminals as a warning that no one is out of the hands of the law.
We'll find you and put you in front of our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of association to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved have been imprisoned for 153 years for drug offences in total.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from a block of death cells in America, as a guest for dinner would like Mohammed Ali and as motivation for the work expressed inequality.
He was negotiating with Klaus and Špidla about the government.
Now the people of John Kasal have sent against Babiš.
People have won 14 Members in the elections, only a third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of YES.
However, they enter into negotiations on the government with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to argue the contours of possible coalitions, Jan Kasal - a man who matched the conditions of government participation in the population in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither Social Democrats nor Andrei Babiš have such a matador on their side.
This time, I think, will be a reminder of the first negotiations in 1992, when ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," estimates Kasal as the interviews will take place this year.
Kenya’s press was outraged by the controversial media law
“It is a scary report and it is right to ask what Parliament will prevent it from simply messing up the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” the paper that considers the bill to be an anti-legislative one.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be presumptuous because it is an extended hand of government" and that restrictions on content and advertising will harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill actually gives the government “full control of the media” and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya “scrambled a hard blow” and criticise the bill as “stern”.
Approval of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately following the September attack of the Islamic shooter in the Westgate shopping centre.
An act of authorities turned on the Kenya media when she was broadcasting a security camera, on which soldiers sent to the scene of the attack reportedly robbed a store of luxury goods.
The police director responded by calling two journalists and the head of the media staff for questioning, but the appeal was later withdrawn.
According to the new bill, media companies can be fined by up to 20 million Kenya's shillings and individual journalists up to one million together with the risk of "disclosure from the list" or they can be denied official press accreditation.
The General Court also has the right to seize the property of the perpetrator if the penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “there is one fine enough to eliminate most of the radio stations. ”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what is called the “live blogosphere” in Kenya.
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do whatever they want.
“You never know what can happen,” wrote a journalist named Nation Mutuma Mathiu and described Kenya’s media as the key source of the system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“If we leave it on the politicians, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting,” he wrote.
In the past, the legislators in Kenya have been the target of public criticism.
In May, they voted for the abolition of cuts directed by the national wage agency and for the renewal of their fat salaries of around 532,000 untaxed shillings per month, which are thus among the highest in the world.
They have to work together, young Czechs know.
Most of them have no idea what interest
More and more Czechs put their money aside.
Yet they do not reach the savings champions in the region.
Most of the money is saved by Austrians, who save on average EUR 181 a month.
A little more than the Czechs will save people in Slovakia.
This comes from a survey by Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern European countries.
It also showed that the mood of the organizers is improving and two thirds of the surveyed plan to put more money aside.
While Czechs are about in the middle of a ranking of organizers, people with savings in Romania and Serbia still use very little products.
For example, almost every other Serb saves "under the pillow" according to the survey.
In the country this year, the number of people who would save more than a month has increased.
Last month, between thousands and CZK 2.5 thousand and 26 percent of respondents, this year it is five percent more.
The average monthly position in the year-on-year comparison however slightly decreased to CZK 2078.
The greatest hit among savings products is pension insurance.
This favors 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the other hand, the popularity of building savings is falling, and, compared to last year, interest in investment funds has also declined significantly.
They only use 16 percent of the respondents, while they were almost a quarter last year.
The survey also revealed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what product yields they make.
First of all, young people within 30 years do not know how their money is spent.
On the contrary, the oldest group in question has the best knowledge of the profitability of their money deposited, and 73 percent of the people over 50 have known it.
In the international comparison of Erste Group, Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which regularly uses 44 percent of people.
They are followed by the Slovaks and the Austrians with a 12% distance.
The UN celebrates the new objectives of combating poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work without delay on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Prior to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting sustainable development objectives to replace MDGs whose validity expires in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document approved by the world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
The UN Secretary-General, Mr Ki-mun, said overnight at the summit that it is now time to "rise above national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over a process to implement the overall SDG," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 Development Programme.
I will make every effort to meet the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the MDG.
The concerns about the safety of Mozambique are escalating due to the conflict of strong personalities.
Under the statue of the Samora Machela, the Mexican president of the founder, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maput to call for peaceable passwords to a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Out of fear for the future of her country, she replaced her business clothes for a shirt decorated with the word "we demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the Square of Independence in the capital.
For two weeks, almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo side, about one of the worst fights since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement, originally supported by the Belarusian government in Rhodesia and then by the government of apartheid in South Africa as part of an effort to destabilise the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became a opposition party.
Analysts believe that it is unlikely that an open conflict would be reinstated in the country, but recent events would be plagued by foreign investors and locals.
There is a fast-growing economy at stake because the discovery of extensive coastal oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest over the next few years can bring in investments worth over $50 billion from companies such as the Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, the Italian Eni and the American Anadarko.
The ruling party of Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo have accused each other of the resulting tension.
On 17 September, the Renamo claimed that the government had caused recent conflicts by initiating an attack on their members in the province of Sofia, the traditional Basis of the Renamo Party.
The violent assault of former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the base of the Renamo Party and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said for the Financial Times spokesperson of the Renamo Fernando Mazanga Party.
The government's accusing Renamo of starting conflicts because they say they attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuzu tried to ease his fears of instability.
Mr. Guebusa for the French press office AFP said on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as "a loser" who wanted to use "anything he could do to prove to the government that he could order his own decisions".
Both Frelimo and Renamo claim to want to avoid war.
However, concerns increased when Mr. Mazanga's words were quoted that the Renamo Party was withdrawing from the 1992 Peace Agreement.
The letter FT said he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our goal is to go back to the negotiations, but with seriousness," said Mr Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease tension between these parties, blown up by a series of fights this year.
It is a scarlet between two great personalities (Guebusa and Dhlakama), said a teacher at the Open University and an expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither one of them is a good negotiater, and neither one of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which sought electoral changes, has already expressed itself that it would boycott the municipal elections planned for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort of the dying movement to gain benefits from the government and financial benefits.
Since 1992, the election share of the Renamo Party has decreased, while the newer party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (DHM), which was founded by the former Renamo Party, will improve its position in the elections as expected.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuz – to whom the second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"He does not want a democratic system of multiple parties, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to release the presidency," said Mazanga.
It's unclear what the Renamo party has, but it's done a disruptive terrorist attack on the police station and on vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.
Most of the fights occurred in Sofala Province, which is several hundred kilometres away from the capital of Maputo, but where Beira is the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on it for their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended the railway use for about a week when the Renamo party threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to comment on whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased frustration from government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent flood of kidnapping.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is solely borne by the government and the President and that he is to be the one to find the solution to the problems," he says.
The Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models for a way of life," says the author.
The stories of Thor can show that “a strong force can’t be equal to a clever lewdness” while Arthur’s legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths would “be too wild for school teaching, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene”, said Crossley-Holland, who intercedes for careful selection of works of age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been defending this plan for 20 years.
He added that "openly instructive" authors and teachers were like "off" in the enticing story of the "under the threshold" message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who from English translated epos Beowulf and who also writes Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and British national stories, says: "You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is some sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended in happyend, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly determined.
The old truth is that it's better to show than to describe.
Brno observatory takes visitors to space in a new digitarium
At first sight, it is clear that the large planetarium's hall has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can fall into new comfortable seats, and above their heads there has been a projection area of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, the new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are disbanded after the O.R.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It is about twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of the Brno observatory Jiří Dušek.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than with classic personal computers," observed the technician from the observatory Tomáš Hladík.
The digitarium is capable of enchanting an extremely realistic and plastic model of night sky, human body, or ocean floor.
The viewers will be so open right in the middle of the universe or the brain of a man.
Another similar device is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The head of the observatory is planning to show purchased shows and own works in the hall.
There's two shows on the show since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about the training of astronauts, fly into space, turn to centrifuge, and then see how challenging astronaut conditions are in space.
The second show is for children and has the name Magical cliffs - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colourful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until a nearby volcano erupted.
The whole digitarium cost approximately CZK 50 million, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory contributed to the smaller amounts from its budget.
The projection area was ten million crowns, a projector of twelve million.
"The rest swallowed audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitaria followed the reconstruction of the whole building, which the observatory passed two years ago.
According to Director Dušek, 25 to 30 000 visitors could come by the end of the year.
We've studied 11 OF THE INZERATS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis detected over 11,000 ads offering a job, of which 4300 were published in the daily press and 6800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet therefore becomes the most important media for the publication of job offers.
In 2005, when the survey first took place, the figure was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it reached about 60 percent.
The sale of job opportunities in itself according to the analysis largely reflects the current situation in the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of ads published in the period of economic prosperity and in the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25,900 ads were published in the same reference period, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of positions on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of daily press employment covers a wider spectrum of professions, including those of workers, stated by the author of the analysis of Pavlín Štěštová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, leading sites were visited by ads looking for managers and managers, sales representative, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or leading small enterprises was only on the Internet.
In the day-to-day press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower; on the contrary, large representations are mainly service and work professions.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently mentioned requirements expressed by employers through advertising offers.
Other monitored areas included knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was given in three percent of ads, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In only two percent of ads employers requested active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The claims for 'computer capacity' appeared in 40 percent of ads (in daily print in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of ads.
The requirements for practice are linked in every way to qualified professions.
These are mainly the managers of production and other leading workers.
In the case of workers' professions, they are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, the author added the study Jiří Tillner.
In the middle of their advertisements, employers also provide requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
The most frequently required skills have already been developed by communication skills in the advertisement in the first place in the long term.
In addition, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, independence, responsibility, organisational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The 10th anniversary of the New Yorker comedy festival
It could be claimed that the city of New York is a place where a solo comic performance was born in America: almost a hundred years ago a career artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chair of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began telling jokes to the gathered people by the method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York comedy festival.
The festival, founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines solo comedy institution, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they were too big to play at the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performance of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the Stand Up for Heroes, an annual musical benefit performance in Madison Square Garden, which will include Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As this festival has spread, so has the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival came from unconventional channels such as the show in smaller radio or television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has gone out with his sitcom (a very hot "League" for a fantastic-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central Station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the Saturday Night Live and the "Parks and Recreation", but the most famous was the rapidly growing series of videos "Marcel the shell with shoes on".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly identifiable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a pessimistic, racially targeted W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest tossers of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he held a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me when he was here, he used to walk through an alley between two buildings, and he said, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
The price of oil further fell to $96 a barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about high stocks balanced the report, which showed the strengthening of the Chinese energy-intensive manufacturing sector.
The US oil indicator for December deliveries decreased in European e-commerce at New York trading stock by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel during the late morning.
On Thursday was a drop of 39 cents and for October fell by 5.8 percent.
Rich oil supplies in the past weeks have burdened the price.
On Wednesday, the Ministry of Energy declared that US supplies have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production gave rise to greater demand that showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery would continue to grow after the previous two weak decades in the third quarter to 7.8%.
Oil Brent, an international oil indicator also used by American refineries, fell on the International Trade Exchange in London by 26 cents to 108.58 dollars a barrel.
No way, Mr. Hash.
We have a unique way of telling politicians not to do that.
It is necessary to put such pressure on Martin Hasek to be deprived of all political functions and to leave the Members' mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so low.
Martin Hasek is engaged in the promise he has given, but everyone and politics must be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise and seriously consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babiš has the material one, but it is the question of whether it is a politician).
A better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he withdraws in politics.
Mr. Haszek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in this, if you did not just lie - here you see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and assumes his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless weakness whose words or actions cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be proud or a missing person or a lifelong sketch.
You may find it unfair when I only address you, but you're the leader and they're the wrong sheep.
And you're the leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to get your ears down for a while, regroup the forces, sit the shame and then attack again, but that's how the guerrillas or the perp act.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes leader Alpha male, so act like one.
Accept responsibility and leave politics.
The Court of First Instance blocked the regulation concerning the procedure for the detention and search of persons by the police department in NY
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked a court order requiring changes in the program of stopping and searching persons at the New York Police Department and the judge dismissed the case.
The second US appeal federal court has said that Judge Shiry Scheindlin's decision will be postponed until the decision on the appeal that the city has filed.
The judge in August decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its programme of stopping and questioning people.
The town’s conclusions and its amending regulation have occurred, including the decision to allocate surveillance, which would help the police department change its procedures and the training programme associated with them.
The appeal was heard on Tuesday by the court of appeal for the requested suspension.
The court of appeal has said that the judge must be dismissed from the case because she had entered into a conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, namely that she did not act as a judge in accordance with the requirement to avoid the appearance of subjudication, partly because of a series of discussions with the media and the public statement, which she openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge has decided that police officers have violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they have been unfairly focusing on blacks and Hispanics in their program of stopping and searching for persons.
It established independent surveillance to oversee major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and surveillance, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test the cameras carried out on the body in certain areas where the most frequent detention takes place.
In August, New York agreed to end the method of keeping names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The oral justification for the city's appeal is scheduled sometimes after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching individuals have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form there has been a halting and search of persons for about a number of decades, but the inspections recorded under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to record number 684 330 in 2011, in most cases they were blacks and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of whom were among minorities, wrote a complaint that had become a case of group action.
The advocates of changes to the police department’s detention and search programme claim that changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how other police departments use these procedures.
The opponents argue that changes will reduce police morality, but not crime, and that it will waste money, but it will not solve a broader problem when the police force is under pressure after several thousand people have been reduced in the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not put an end to the practice of stopping and searching people who were constitutional, but reformed the way the inspections of the police department in the NY did.
Five shopping centers are confronted with low attendance
This results from Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle's real estate consulting data.
In Prague Bohnice, the shopping centre of Krakow is opened to the public, it will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
In the Czech Republic, there are now a total of 90 major shopping centers.
The disappointing performance concerns about 20 percent of medium and large centres.
The main problems are an inadequately large centre towards the locality and bad layout, i.e. too much floor or complicated and opaque arrangement of the passages or possibly dead places of the center," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
According to the head of the department of retail real estate Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five shopping centers are facing low attendance.
The main reasons include, inter alia, poor transport accessibility, low income categories of local residents or market overcapacity at the site.
Some projects opened up almost fully occupied, but their results were mostly disappointing at first.
Today, customers are rather conservative, and they don't like to change their shopping habits.
New shopping centers must try harder to attract their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
According to Soták, the availability of shopping centres is generally stable, even in some centers it is rising because the tenants were willing to discount rent from rent and rent some units in the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened up, which are not fully occupied and the average capacity is so reduced (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouc)," said Soták.
Trade centres opened in the past two years are very slow on the market, according to Sylvia Samadi.
However, there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague, we see space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
In the market there is certainly space for the construction of smaller local projects, the so-called 'convinence centres', focused on the purchase and service of daily needs for the population living in the immediate surroundings," Samadi said.
According to Soták, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
Both for small 'service' centres as well as for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or for expansion in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have space for further growth," said Soták.
In Prague they see space for the prepared shopping center on the Victory Square, and according to him they have clear potential of the street Na Příkopě and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks which enable traders to cover and expand into ever smaller cities at favourable rent and operating costs, the space is also in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, and their reconstructions such as the reconstruction of business houses Prior, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková of DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centers in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross leased areas.
The quarter of all these shopping centers is located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, results from Incoma GfK data.
In the number of shopping parks the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared with values from Britain and France it is 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked his phone to check the tip
The former editor of the News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods of "on the phone, tracking and confrontation" to confirm the fraudulent tip on the love relationship that the Minister of Home Charles Clarke was supposed to be involved in.
D.A. Andrew Edis in Old Bailey's court said that News of the World caught false reports in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and penetrated her privacy, but in court, Coulson also called her and left her a voicemail.
"The National Representative suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the person standing outside the house hoping to catch people outside, but the person who likes to tell people stories to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: breaking into a phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
She obviously knows about the other one, the surveillance, she needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "But of course he does."
The love relationship with Clarke has been captured for the first time by the NotW News Department, when the sources that sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby were said: "You're wasting your time, it's with Charles."
The recording of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained in Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects".
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, her grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about Pawlby, said Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup supervised Mrs Pawlby's movement.
Coulson left her a voice report on June 18, 2005, saying: “I got a story that I’m about to publish tomorrow and that I would love to talk to Charles about.”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was according to the same model as other prominent personalities, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
It was in court on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett for a love relationship with a married woman, while he himself was seeing the defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied association with other people to hack phones from October 3, 2000 to August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking into the phone.
NSA exposure increases the social paranoia of state monitoring
One day at the end of August, the German police helicopter buzzed over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
Following the instructions of the Federal Institute Protection Office (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the American forwarded patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claims that BfV hoped that it would be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and that this action triggered an exchange of views between the US and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, the American Director of National Intelligence, again insisted that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities, “to steal business secrets from foreign companies in favour of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant from his co-worker, began to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, the European Government and leading entrepreneurs no longer know if they should trust the words of the director.
Following reports that the US National Security Agency carried out espionage in the Brazilian oil company and gained access to data with US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, has achieved a general paranoia of the state monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came up with the discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been bugged for ten years.
If the target may be the most powerful person in Europe, then they are certainly potential targets and leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between American intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents the small and medium IT company in Germany.
According to an EY survey issued in July, German companies are convinced that in terms of industrial espionage and data the US now poses as much risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in all the documentation revealed by Mr Snowden that the United States has been passing trade secrets on to its own companies from foreign companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain skills in the area of IT and the Internet and said that it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
The leading entrepreneurs are skeptical.
German Parliament has heard voices that we should make German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them again slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he wasn't supposed to let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany reaches, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scope and technical development of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden is shocking to some companies who have so far believed that China's greatest surveillance threat is still a shock.
There is a large turnover in cloud computing technology, where European leaders have realised to a large extent that data stored in the US are under there jurisdiction and therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, around 10 percent of non-American members, after the U.S. Data Lowering Programme revealed that the plans for using a cloud provider based in the US were abolished.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “Do we have a new question for customers who weren’t here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction?”
Many German high-level actors argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets, and these data must be protected at all costs.
An economic espionage is not a surprise.
It's always been done.
“It has been a crucial topic for many years and it has not changed significantly during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Director General of the Agrochemical Society of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to boast of the countermeasures they have made so that they may not confer an advantage on the attacker.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car board, says that for many years now it is common practice to collect mobile phones before the meeting, so that it is not possible to use them as listening devices.
The German BfV advises its managers to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign travels because of the risk that smart phones can be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are leading global market leaders in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access,” she warns in her BfV report.
The US warns its own company against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, US National Intelligence Estimate reported in February France, next to Russia and Israel, in a second series of perpetrators who are involved in the hacker's work for the economic rapporteurs, right behind China.
A member of the board in the German risk-free society concluded that “the French are the worst in terms of economic espionage”.
Bernard Squarkini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said this month in one of the talks: “Services know very well that all countries, while cooperating in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies. ”
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a tangled combat spirit in his high school gym, believing that their son was murdered, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found engulfed on January 11 in a spiritually level behind the bleachers at the high school gym where he went.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowdes County concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old boy refuses to do so.
“They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered,” said FoxNews.com lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacques Johnson.
They never believed he died like the sheriff said.
“They are convinced that this contradicts logic, physical laws, and also common sense,” said Crump.
They believe that this should cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school, and he returned to them in a bag of corpses," he said.
D.A. Michael Moore said he was investigating Johnson's death on Thursday, and he noted that a number of key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
Moore said a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for normal investigation," he said.
Moore told the journalists that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson died of "field suffocation".
The second autopsy, however, reported another cause of death, according to Moore.
“There are several questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if Johnson was found sufficient evidence in the case of Johnson's death for a warrant to investigate a crime or a violation of civil rights, he would ask the FBI and its execution.
Sheriff's office in Lowdes County was not available on Thursday for any comments.
The judge in southern Georgia ordered the authorities to make available all the videos of the surveillance cameras that the investigators checked.
Teenage parents hope that the videos will contain traces of how their son died.
CDC centre has issued directives on allergy in children for schools
In the centre of the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), a set of directives has been published to help in the case of child allergy to food at school.
This is the first set of directives issued by the US Government, due to the fact that the number of children of school age suffering from food allergy is rising.
One of the 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergy in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The directive provides for schools information on how to notify the teacher and staff of child allergy to food and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline – the most commonly used is the EpiPen auto injector – in order to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The state legislative authorities have recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more simply.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, "It's like someone is fucking me in the tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue," or "itchy tongue".
Parents of Intersexual Children Can Choose “Unidentified Sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize the third sex in children born with inconclusive sexual organs.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned only to male or female sex.
The new law of parents does not require any gender to be introduced for such children, allowing them to state on their birth certificates the gender as "unidentified" or "unspecific".
The purpose of the law is to stop pushing parents to decide in a hurry for surgery to determine sex, and to combat discrimination against those who are intersexual.
After many years of intersexuality, the BBC said: “I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I'm going to be a satin made by doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year 2000 children are born one that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
Sex determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when you cannot determine sex, it is better to use the best available information and determine them instead of waiting and watching the psychological and physical development of the child until the surgery is carried out, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender problems, said that the new German law "looks like a good thing".
Intersexual children represent ethical dilemmas.
“Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children do not,” he said.
The gender determination can be done without the operation and then it can wait to see how the identity develops.
The knowledge of how sexuality develops in a child is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 describes intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both, and cannot be clearly defined as either one of them.
These features can be manifested in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breast and character, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the field of work, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to indicate male, female or "third-sex" in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian woman, became the world's first "sexless" person in June when she won a judicial appeal so that she could retain the status of "undefinite" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the German passports will have, in addition to M (man) and F (woman) and the third marking, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighboring France, according to the report on France, 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition for the removal of "sex theory" from school textbooks.
The Catholic online American website also defined itself against the German law and wrote: “With the way the world is drawn to a new state, when sex is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we turn two other pillars of civilization inside out.”
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also said to Baby Zone that she would rather see the gender attached at birth to the children.
“Rodicism itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,” she said to the website about parental care.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to the handsome River, who had double sex.
And for about ten years back, the medical community thought that sex was like a board that could erase and repaint.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation with the fact that sexuality is a complex matter, and sometimes doctors can make the wrong decision because they do not know how children will feel about their sexes when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The persistent theory of how to treat children with inconclusive sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that sex is subjective.
He created a new concept of "sexuality" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment – as parents raised their child – affected genes and hormones and formed a child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one 1966 case known as "John/John", his theory became a dispute.
The parents of the boy whose penis was damaged because of the wrong circumcision, recommended that they allow his child to castrate completely, remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the fact was different,” said Drescher.
When the boys were 15 years old, he got back to surgery on a boy and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “have used this model ” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared "unhappiness with the result".
It was also a case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes, but an unequivocal sexual system.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never live as a man with a “satisfactory life”.
And so shortly after his birth in 1976 Bruce was surgically removed from the outer organs and testicles and was raised as a girl.
At 12, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said to ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
He was sent to the vagina plastic at 18.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After my birth, I was sterilized, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its genital system.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took testosterone doses and had his breast removed,
The operation caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called Interface Project and is trying to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, the legal director of the Advocates for an informed choice, based in California, is concerned that the German law "is calling for branding and stigmatism".
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will reach out to encouraging parents to make quick decisions and choose “undefinite” for the child,” she said.
We're afraid it'll encourage intervention.
We believe that it is better to allocate male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will finally confess, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because “it allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex”.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid gender," she said.
The German law is going to assign it at birth.
It's a battle a little child shouldn't seduce at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a disorder in sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law "providing powers" for both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called insensitive syndrome on androgens.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, they developed in Katie's female traits.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have a uterus and ovaries.
Now Katie is 29-year-old and works as an intern at child psychiatry as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or foster motherhood.
“The law will give the parents a certain amount of space to take their decision,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and think about it, and it gives them time to write "man" or "woman".
In this respect, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have an amazing child, and you're happy about it.
You don't have to rush operations that are irreversible.
“It brings the possibility of including a child in the decision and removes the anxiety that parents bind because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex to identify with – and that is a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The monkey swallowed the house with petrol: He threatened to burn it down with his own family!
The tensions were rising, fear was escalating.
A man began to threaten to burn down the whole house.
For this reason, all available police patrols in the area, as well as the Mladá Boleslav fire department and the voluntary fire department, went to the site.
A police negotiator came to the scene who tried to talk him out of irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to burn down the house.
Thus, a task force must have entered the house, which has polluted men and bound them.
The aggressor then finished his examination at the young Boleslaus hospital, from where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic detention station.
In the end, firemen put gas on the house by a sorbent, which they later cleaned.
Moreover, all pets were also rescued from the house.
He didn't put a man in a police negotiations, so a commanding officer followed him.
Message: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden as Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisor to New York Times secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton in 2012.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly expected 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times magazine received a copy of the coming book and announced on Thursday night that the President’s top co-workers had held intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether ridding Biden would help bring Obama’s daunting re-election hope back to life.
According to a national political correspondent for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely the former Head of the White House of Bill Daley, to measure what effect the former Foreign Secretary Clinton should have on the election to move him to vice president's post.
Potential change was a top secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the President's closest advisers – including Daley, former Head of Obama's campaign Jim Messina and former chief advisers at the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book “Double down” claims that Daley was a representative of trying to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would not increase Obama’s chances significantly.
In an interview with Martin Dalea, he confirmed that the administration really considered replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've been intensively examining a whole range of things, and this was one of them," he said for Dalea's letter.
You must not forget that at that time the president had terrible prospects, so we thought: “Christ, what should we do?
While Daley characterized research as “an important care,” Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-elected campaign spent a small amount of investment to find out if this move was worth the election.
"There is no such money being spent on election campaigns and qualitative research, unless something really is considered," Martin said at AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about this potential card mix-up.
While Daley said that he did not think that the president was aware of the potential changes, the former Head of the Bureau admitted that it was "probable" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe had reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on cutting Biden out of the candidate.
"Maybe," said Martin.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman made the first ice cream that shines in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a shining pamphlet.
He came up with the idea when he read a professional meditation on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes lighting.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer’s tongue – it increases the pH in the protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream lights when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, and that's why the more you look, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company, "Lick me I'm delicious", says he: "It's an amazing substance, but as far as production is concerned, we're at the beginning, so for 200 GBP you get about 2 g of this substance."
The white woman we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your mouth protein warms up, the pH is rising, and the ice cream is starting to shine.
We've been testing it in the last few months, and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it's causing this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the jellyfish lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every hill costs me about £140.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But its next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says: “I would really like to make invisible ice cream. ”
In essence, it's impossible because of the flame of light caused by the crystal of ice that makes ice cream, but I'm counting on some way to do it, we'll find it.
Ice cream uses fluorescence properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: according to numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a mole.
For two years, my apartment hasn't had any candy, and this year probably won't be different.
But statistics show that I'm, as far as Halloween is concerned, a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), this year most Americans will celebrate Halloween – in fact 158 million of them – and spend 6.9 billion dollars on sweets, costumes and ornaments.
But every time I look forward to Halloween, there are trends.
According to the NRF, out of $6.9 billion worth of dollars is expected to go 1.2 billion for costumes.
This year is the last shot at fashion sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be women anymore; sexy can also be food like pizza, hamburger and carrot.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the dead parade, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will reach our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year, we put our dogs in costumes, and we weren't the only ones to my astonishment.
In fact, the Americans according to the NRF are spending $330 million this year on costumes for animal lovers.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans are going to spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark sticks.
This is an amazing report for 41 million co-workers who, according to the U.S. Department of Trade, are about to attack our neighborhood.
In fact, we will buy during Halloween, and believe it or consume, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Confectionery, nearly 16 thousand tons sell around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
It's a secret I've never deciphered.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as the Terror behind the walls, which is by the way a real prison, "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are officially dedicated 1200 haunted houses that, according to the American Scary Houses, have a profit of $500 million, and that includes those amazing photos that you're peeing on fear and that your friend will put on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like will take a look at the photo and writes a comment on "you look nice".
And in the end, a little bit about pumpkins.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the great pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and the pumpkin lampery carving is something like decorating a Christmas tree – we do it from a baby.
Fortunately for us, the trend of "baby in pumpkin" started thanks to the Pinterest application only last year, so most of us grew up carving up instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. census office, Americans spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
A pumpkin meadow with a hot flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245 thousand tonnes of pumpkin grew this year.
If you're looking for something special, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut their pumpkin weighing almost one tonne.
Announced series of Land Rover racing
The interior has racing seats and six-point safety belts as well as communication devices.
The choice is improved brakes, a service package providing access to the Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and storage of the vehicle between individual races.
Drew Bowler, the technical director of the Bowler Motorsport, said: “The participants of the races coming to the Bowler have changed.”
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also achievable way to race the world class.
We are glad that we can offer them this journey in cooperation with the Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare contestants for the hardness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
The development of the car Defender Challenge we really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge will offer training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have early elections within two years
The president of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election.
A week after the last one in an interview for News.cz he said that there is no other way out and every government is coming out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, saying that the lifetime of the starting term is estimated to be two years.
With the objection that the voters will hardly choose differently next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the president of TOP 09 does not accept that his party could lose voters in the next elections as this year (compared to 2010 he lost approximately 300 000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that early elections will be, it will strengthen the ANO 2011 movement Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
Turbulent situation in ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of the Party's leadership, stated that he or Michal Hašek would remain in charge of social democracy, commenting on Schwarzenberg's following:
"Leaders of the Democratic Party as little boys follow the head of the state to enable them to reverse on the side."
"I thought Mr. Hask was more skillful and intelligent."
"Because I have never seen anything so eagerly done in my life," said the president of TOP 09.
And towards President Zeman (with whom he met in the fight for presidential office) he said: "The role of the head of the state is clear: He wants to seize that party."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was your biggest election surprise for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally presented its first draft laws in the House, including the Far Register of Contracts, which discussed the Chamber Committees before the elections, but with early elections fell below the table.
The chair of TOP 09 in an interview for Update.cz claims that such speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the "Ano Martin Komárek" movement accused TOP 09 in the electoral struggle for the idea of introducing a register of contracts "claring" the program of the "Ano" movement.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply dusted the proposal, which has already taken place in the second chamber reading.
Fire Departments have come to rescue a lost puppy who's stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous perforation in a stonestone.
The cock of Ruby's Spanish ran off after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was seen trapped in a stonestone by a man who walked a dog.
The firemen were salted on the rock wall to save the dog from a certain death.
The puppy was set free by fire troops who came to free him after somehow being trapped on a dangerous cliff in a stone above the ground.
A nine-month-old spaniel Ruby fled after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived himself for three days until he was released from a stonestone on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and their friend Becky Hall (20) were in the Flappit Stonestone in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he escaped, when he got into a small accident, they were searching for their lost dog and putting challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, about 14.15, a bright-sighted dogman, trapped Ruby, saw a perforation in a stonestone 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton fire station was speeding up and salted down to free Ruby, using it to pick up on the rock of the animal transport bag.
Chief of the technical rescue team Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of a rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't move his eyebrow when he was saved. He was totally frozen.
He's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
It's incredible that someone saw the dog.
The expert chief of the technical rescue team, Peter Lau, said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape.”
There was a chance that he would be very seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to a vet for the search, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was afraid looking at a rescue event. ”
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him in his arms again.
The vet said if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
Firemen did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them. They were all just huge.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
Firemen were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely didn't make it.
During an interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" from 2004 sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went out after her.
And she added: “That was a long time ago, and now he is very nice to me.”
In a statement from Thursday of Jagger (70) the representative said that he categorically refused that he would ever make Katy Perry proposals.
The deputy said: “Maybe he's confused with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the guest singers (songwriters) who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted first this week.
George Kerrevan: Split Europe Gives Scotsmen a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that the condition for independent Scotland to join the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This involved the cause of the stories of passport checks in Berwick and the barbed wire along Hadrian's Val.
It is true that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned possible economic advantages of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as could be expected – this was not reflected in the headlines of the newspaper.
No one also mentioned that EU Member States spent a lot of time adapting their official laws, if appropriate.
Given that Scotland is not in Schengen now, the offer of continuing inconsistencies would be a cheap concession for Brussels for anything they really want from Scotland.
So it's a pretty weak story.
In addition, so old that he became a digger. A journalistic duck that “independence means passport control”, I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet, there is an interesting idea in this bearded story.
Why should it be expected that independent Scotland will listen to Europe?
Why trade the London chomout for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a real European story: the great postwar plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The result of the euro crisis is the so-called Project Europe officially dead.
Across Europe, they gain the influence of a party dedicated to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party of Alternativa for Germany, founded in this year, came out of nowhere, and already in September's federal elections, raised almost five million votes, thus basically "out of the Bundestag" Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
There was always resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe on home soil.
However, the current economic crisis has become a crucial moment.
The savings dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the custodial bond on the national economies through the latching on the common currency, have led many to believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments run a high budget deficit – that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is the euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters – this is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, South Europe has a disadvantage on domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenue and public expenditure – which Germany calls for.
With the current budgetary and monetary problems, the deeper cause of Europe's small performance is European.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – the code to support French and German companies on consumer costs – applies to the European industry twice as much as electricity and four times as gasoline in the United States.
This is a paralysing disadvantage in the field of costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the wage freezes in the world would not reverse the stumbling down of the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a daunting rebellion, especially in France, once enthusiastic EU supporters.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that will keep Germany in check and allow Paris to face the world at Washington level.
Berlin, however, no longer needs to see Paris as a political card of legitimacy and advocated its own economic policy and the worn-out French economy has left its fate in Europe.
Result: The right wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won crucial additional elections and has pushed the ruling socialists to third place.
The front is now with 24% of the vote the most popular side in France – early warning to British Labourists that they cannot assume that the right cutting will automatically show up on the left.
How does Le Penová deal with its newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
The European elections next year would like to use them to create an anti-European block against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are doing well in these elections, which is likely to do so, they can dominate such a block for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
In my mind, in the short term, the growing anti-European feeling and the position against the common currency will merge and the euro will perish.
The EU does not disappear, but rather transforms into something more freer in the sense of "Europeans (survival) nations", the general de Gaulle already preferred.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and South Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, the increased interest of Washington in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind by the Atlantic Coolness.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be areas (mainly) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – the possibility to announce Berlin and Brussels, when we are to be left alone.
I suppose Scotland would have done well in a relaxed Europe's arrangement, provided it has kept its own currency.
Working with other similar thinking countries would be easier in a non-Federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Government of SNP in Scotland is – surprisingly – the most successful political movement not promoting austerity measures in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011 due to the opposition attitude towards cuts planned (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalitions of conservatives and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence just to take austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Advanced Previous
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind this
Experts say that one of the triggers of earlier puberty could be obesity epidemics.
The trend of early puberty is not so evident with boys.
The former rapporteur, CNN Pat Etheridge, is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Is her mother supposed to freak out when her daughter starts to grow breasts and hairs on shame at 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time making sure my parents weren’t usually a sign of rapid development towards a full puberty,” said Kaplowitz
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, dehairing and armpits, and the body smell, appear earlier in the girls.
In the last forty years, however, there has been a small shift at the age of the first menstruation.
In the United States, it is now the average age of 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 in 1970.
“When breasts begin to develop, at least two to three years will pass before the first period occurs,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem” (The Need for a Guide to handle this common problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty continues is time.
It is discussed what activates the real start of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spurts before 8 years of age, the girl is considered "premier."
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – which children’s doctors can carefully monitor.
Faster growth can be a reason for the endocrinologist to perform tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are therapeutic procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging, which may eventually lead to a halt in adulthood and growth.
The recommendations for medicines and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child, on the rate of development, on the rate of growth and on the emotional maturity.
Psychociological aspects are also important.
With regard to drug deployment, Kaplowitz is careful, but acknowledges that “repression of puberty can ease the problems of the girl’s behavior and feelings that they differ from their peers”.
Of course, there is another big problem: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have a menstruation.
“They are concerned that they may become pregnant, or how they will manage hygiene,” said Kaplowitz.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began to have menstruation at 10 years old.
Although there were signs, and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and mad that she was first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no consistent set of evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or the sex message in the media.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most serious reason is obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped study girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which combines body fat with puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country African-Americans and Hispanics tend to achieve puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, early puberty patterns appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although the boys of low age have been showing facial hair and dishonor, the trend towards the full bloom of early puberty is not as clear as that of girls.
Other doctors attending the Conference of the American Association of Children’s Doctors (AAP) added further complexity to this topic.
Acne and hair loss is common even in infants and backpacks.
“We need to be careful with regard to how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist from Goryebian Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to obtain instructions from their child doctor on how to speak to their child.
“It may mean having to talk to a child before you suppose,” advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls that develop earlier need to make sure that, although it happens early, this process is a normal part of life.
Nadia Konvalinková as a hostess.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Nadia Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the cap in the role of a pub and she was very good at it.
That the favorite Czech actress was planning to change her profession and set herself up in a pub business?
Nada Konvalinková showed up at James Joyce Irish pub and made a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I got it right.
My boss even offered to keep me busy, and I could feed on beer.
But I refused, I would rather stay with what I do today, acting," she said with her smile Konvalinková, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the functioning of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey there," she revealed her tasteful actress.
A long-term friend and colleague Pavel Novi also appeared at the event.
I'm not allowed to drink in this new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I'm trying to keep that up," the actor said.
Aircraft manufacturers are concerned about the width of seats, large contracts are at stake
Between the leading aircraft manufacturers, there was a dispute about seat width in the second class of long-range flights, which this month caused a bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai.
The subject of the dispute is the width of seats provided for long-term flight for the economic class – not the one which is normally preceded by airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency claims for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus called for industrial standards this week, which would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the major US rival Boeing says they are to decide on this.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers competed in selling the largest version of their two-engine remote aircraft with the potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear part of the aircraft is spread – especially if it is next to each other 9 or 10 seats – is the basis of economic performance claims for the design of the new aircraft "mini-jumbo".
Boeing says that an improved model "777X" will deliver 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 will deliver 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out after 9.
Giant aeroplanes often attack each other on technical issues through advertising in the professional media.
Airbus is now ahead of the air show in Dubai, where it is expected that 777X will gain advantage with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what might be the start of a new advertising war when the financiers showed a picture showing three people sealed in a restaurant with the title “Do you like it?”
“Boeing promotes long-range flights in seats narrower than on regional turbovrtul planes,” said Airbus’s sales manager John Leahy.
As the food tips change, people are bigger, but the seats on the planes haven't changed radically.
From the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern remote air transport, until the turn of the century, according to the U.S. Department of Health, the weight of an average American aged 40-49 increased by 10 percent.
According to American medical statistics, the average American is 100 cm in the 21st century.
Airbus claims that his rival has been holding on to the concept of seats from the 1950s when the average width of seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims that it has carried out a study suggesting that the extension of the seat by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus's seat dimensions and says that it is not in the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that cabin experience depends on more things than just on the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do things that they believe they have to do to make them successful,” said Kent Craver, an expert in cabin space.
They don't want us to dictate to them what their profits are.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers there is a substantial space for elbows, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this dispute there is a race in aircraft orders with estimated business in the next decades worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices, enough to bend the scales of American and European exports.
As reported in July by Reuters, the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 percent more effective than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend in part on comparing the design of the 777X model with 10 seats in a row and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-sedated concept.
“The reason Boeing does this is to inflate more seats, and make his aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, leading to the comfort of Airbus passengers for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing models 777 are consistent that many passengers are for a denser distribution that can go hand in hand with lower charges.
“The four-inch wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view Airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777 model,” said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network portal.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer the airlines a catalogue of suppliers so that they can choose.
Scheed aircraft dealers even carry a measuring zone to check the competitive arrangements.
While chasing comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers a model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but it says it hasn't been sold yet.
As a long time ago, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin adjustment by offering a wider seat in the alleys for some of his planes.
Experts say that without the support of a single producer of large modern aircraft, the challenge to new industrial standards will remain unheard of, but it can discourage the waves of sales of 777X.
The number of HIV infected patients exceeded a thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected animals is growing every year.
For example, in 2002 the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later it was 121, and in 2010 it was 180.
Last year it was infected with 212 and it was a record number.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200, which I think is no longer a doubt," said the AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavátý, who had led the Prague House of Light for Patients for Years.
According to him, there were 165 HIV patients in the country from January to September, 176 this year.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of this September, the tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, most infected in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
There were 206 infected in the Central Bohemian Region.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian Region, or 116 from the Ustecky Region.
The least infected came from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
Such a case, however, has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in over a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, and they were transferred from their mother.
The nonsense in the movie Gravitation is, but it's beautiful, says experts
A fantastic film from the universe Gravitace sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic some time after the premiere.
In October, he was seen by the Union of film distributors of nearly 150,000 viewers and he earned over 26 million crowns.
Most of the reviews are positive.
Others, however, find some irregularities.
Server Lidovka.cz asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of the Starry and planetarium Brno): I like scientific and fantastic films that I consider modern, dream fairy tales.
Gravitation film does not replace, although it looks like a "physically real" performance.
No, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I had too much fun with him.
You can notice, for example, the hair of Sandra Bullock, which does not seem to carry in a state of troublelessness.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Station are moving around significantly different orbits, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some film viewers blame the unrealistic effect and the entire behaviour of fire in a state of troublelessness.
The suits, according to them, wouldn't have lasted such wounds either.
Gravitation heroes often get into collisions with different objects and suits without any major difficulty.
Critics were not saved by a historyal plot.
Such an extensive tragedy on Earth's orbit is unrealistic, according to some of the debaters.
Besides, he's wondering why the doctor was sent to space to repair technology.
People argue on forums about the "nerale" behavior of ropes.
They say it works like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Glassman and planetarium of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide screen so far, but I can unequivocally say, I have been enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to adhere consistently to reality.
"More than you mentioned irregularities, I was touched by how the space station was shown three times with degraded levels of technology (the last Chinese ones).
"The Chinese will probably look better after the end of the decade, and it'll probably look better than in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (director of the Astronomic Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, authors are very successful in trying not to break the physical laws, and so naturally oriented viewer appreciates the fact that during various space collisions and collisions, the moment of momentum, speaking the dictionary physics, also the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic, including the thin peel of the atmosphere and the polar glow of the polar regions.
Inconsistencies will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
For example, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various cosmic garbage on orbit appears in some scenes to be reversed before it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomic Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted by the creators to their needs, but no essentials, and to the sky calling for a sin against logic or natural laws, I have not seen in the film and compared to other films of similar focus it is seen that the creators have made a difference in the credibility of the events shown.
From moments that don't make sense to name the fact that Hubble's space telescope is running around in a different orbit than the ISS.
As a result, there is a very different rate of mutuality and rescue operations could not actually take place as shown in the film.
In addition, at the moment of the Kowalski Division (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the whole of the ISS would spin, so there is no clear origin of the power on Kowalski, which forces both actors to move forward when they no longer move towards each other.
A new vaccine against nicotine may remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can remove the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for the rest of her life.
Before human trials, it's necessary to run further tests that take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Well Cornell Medical Faculty in New York says the first signs are good.
“We firmly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to stop and exhaust all the methods available on the market today, but they found that their nicotine dependence is so strong that it overcomes all current approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been compiled to carry genetic information to create antinicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells that then start creating a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies persecute all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, thus preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine intervention.
In the tests vaccinated by the mouse, which was additionally delivered by nicotine, continued their normal activities.
But mice that were not vaccinated, "settled", said researchers, which is a sign that nicotine got into their brain.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often as to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower as they convert liver cells into antibody-producing factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for humans are completely safe, they could give up to children before they want to try a cigarette, and they would avoid nicotine addiction.
But it would be much more likely for smokers to use it to stop.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine they will have no benefit, and that will help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists have said that the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies Obeid’s influence
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee on Corruption.
Former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, denied that he would change the policy of coastal rental at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeida, who had hidden interests in three properties on the government-controlled property.
An independent anti-corruption committee (ICAC) on Friday extended its search for whether Mr Obeid lobbyed with several state ministers to rent him at the Circle Quay, where the Obeidas owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without having to take part in a tender after his termination in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's covert interests in these properties on the basis of evidence presented on Thursday by former Deputy Director of Mr Tripodi's office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of the talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for rent to go to public competition.
The tenants opposed this and also wanted more long-term contractual terms.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeida $2.5 million a year, were restored without the need to participate in the competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a fan of public competitions.
However, he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on moving into government rental policy.
The call transcript submitted at ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Mr Tripodim and Mr. Steve Dunn, the head of the port resort who came after he worked under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
"He was the subject of interviews during these telephone calls on the development of commercial rental policy?" asked Commissioner Whealy, Mr Tripodi, the auxiliary Commissioner.
"No," replied Mr Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not about this.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked the target in Syria, said the responsible agent
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikía on Thursday night, confirmed the responsible authority of the administration of Fox News station.
This responsible factor did not specifically say what objective it was, but he said that there was at least one.
Press Agency Associated Press states that SA-125 missiles were aimed at Russian production.
At least twice before this year Israel conducted an air attack on the supplies of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and they're different.
Like commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it could be agreed, whereas the chairman of Štěch was blowing up the clumsy.
Hetman Chowance was my suspect as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
The President of Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the misery of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen mainly demonstrated their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is fundamental and readable and useless, Vice-President Zaoralek has made the most of the interview on television impossible.
On this basis, I do not see a better option than the ČSSD's proposal to Vice-President Gajdušková, the only one who would not have an initial hendikep, and I think it would have done the standard performance.
That's such a good solution that barely anyone in the management will support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing down the side.
Alena Gajdušková could, without fear, bring together a minority government with only the blessing of President Babiš and without the people, but with the People's Minister of Health of the Hovorka, who is actually a religious social democrat.
This mini-ministerial government would have great stability, as it would enforce a proper referendum law, and it would also be committed to supporting the President of Okamura.
The Chairman of Babiš would finally accept tax progression, for he is bright and will see that it is not possible without him.
People wouldn't cause trouble, because the talker is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in the government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, even here would find a valuable minister, but if they reasonably do not want to join a risky government participation, but they will provide support, also well.
Let's get the courage of Alena Gajduška!
Foreign visa-authorised personnel may undergo a ‘authority’ test
As the government intends to extend police procedures, it considers the "justification" test for foreign personnel with a visa authorisation of 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through the criteria to prevent the 457 programme from being used to meet unqualified jobs, or as a back door to move family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former Labourist MP Maxine McKew condemned government rhetoric about foreign workers with the words that it could offend Australian neighbours.
“Aloud “foreigns at the end of the front” and “work first for Australians” are a very unpleasant remnant from the time the unions requested a protected labour market,” she said to the Australian-Indian Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the white labor force was to be protected – and I would not wonder if anyone in this region had recorded the echo of this historical artifact.
The article discusses 12 measures that were previously considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he deals with officials for smuggling, implemented five of the recommended changes, and others remain to be considered.
Where the criteria for "justification" are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether "the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or a personal relationship with the owner or the sponsor person concerned."
After previous experiences with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employ hundreds of them, companies may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old from Sri Lanka who sought asylum died suspected of having a heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship in the Christmas Islands this week.
A man's nine - year - old scared son traveled to Australia along with him, and after his father died, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
The Australian authorities and a man hurried to the hospital in the Christmas Islands where he died.
The UK Government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase starts in 2026.
The transport minister, Baroness Kramer, said that the project "will bring Britain together".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was working with the British Government on this "extended" plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After the phase two leads the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government re-evaluated the estimated costs of building a high-speed line between London and North England from GBP 32,7 billion to GBP 42,6 billion.
The British Government, which conducted interviews with the National Transport Agency Scotland, commissioned HS2 to discover further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is indeed a national network that will better link Great Britain and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green because the benefit it brings is huge.
Without that, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also a link – 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected across the UK thanks to HS2.
The Scottish minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
During the Scottish government, Keith Brown, Mr Carmichael, called for "unequivocally" to support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed line has the potential to bring an immeasurable economic advantage to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across the UK.”
Thus, we are delighted to work with the British Government to explore the possibilities of bringing high-speed railways to Scotland and thus to bring benefits to everyone and to complete the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, together with the British ministers, next year and the joint decision-making on the next steps.
In conjunction with Bart, anti-corruption police analyst also arrested the inspection.
Information about the arrest of Víta Barta began to spread on Thursday night when the message came to the server FirstRepair.cz.
MF DNES soon discovered that the case had been taken over by the General Security Corps Inspection (GIBS), her people were to arrest Bart in the center of Prague.
It happened outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
However, the inspections deal with cases where they are among the accused police officers, and their powers also apply to civilians.
According to MF DNES, there is one anti-corruption police officer - the head of analytics and computer science Jan Petržílek, among the arrested.
He's worked for Security Information Services in the past.
But spokesperson for the anti-corruption police Jaroslav Ibehej refused to comment on the fact that the media has to turn to GIBS on this matter.
Even her spokesperson, Radka Sandorová, did not want to say anything about the case, referred by turn to the City State Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said the spokesperson of the office of Štěpánka Zenklová.
It can also be derived from this inconclusive reaction that the event took place, but is in a cover-up mode that the spokesman does not allow to say anything specific.
Bart's attorney Oldřich Chudoba is also in a similar situation.
He told the media that Bart's representation was "even in this matter", but given that this is classified information, Bart's arrest cannot be confirmed or denied.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
That was what Bárt and former VV Chairman Radek John, who was the head of the Ministry of the Interior, put into office.
The dispute, which was set on fire between the expremier Peter Nečas and the VV even had to deal with the then President Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I really don't know anything about things," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially pushed out by Radek John, the real boss of the party, but that's when Bart was at the time.
Barta has now run for election for the Dawn movement, and his parliamentary mandate has escaped only a few minutes - by 175 votes.
The leader of the Dawn Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what this was about.
"Welcome to Bart was one of many candidates on our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from Bárta Okamura, who before the election said that he had given Bart space to run for the Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of executioners.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former associate from VV Jaroslav Skárka.
Rules on the use of electronic equipment in aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will have to continue to switch off their tablets and smartphones during their take-off and landing, regardless of the changes in the US in order to mitigate the regulations regarding these devices.
The American Federal Air Administration (FAA) has given US companies space to change their procedures, so that passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical phases of the flight if the equipment stays in the "air" mode.
Travelers can already do this during the most part of the flight, but many people are annoyed by the fact that they cannot access their electronic books during the launch and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires US carriers to work hard to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they are not planning to change their procedures shortly.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it examined this notification but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment at critical phases of the flight are still in force in Australia.
“CASA currently has no specific provisions governing the use of electronic equipment on an aircraft,” he said.
This question is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virginia, who had already talked to CASA about extending the use of its wi-fi on-board entertainment system, was inclined to change, but announced that it would be subject to a regulatory authority’s decision.
"We would welcome that CASA has analyzed the permission to use electronic equipment, because we really think that it would improve customer experience now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment)," the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will follow the current rules for the time being.
“Our current policy is that electronic equipment must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it soon,” he said.
The FAA rules apply to American airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area that can be useful for our passengers, and we are sure to study the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulation will be different from the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference with mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
“As soon as the airline confirms its fleet’s tolerance, it may allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones at any altitude,” said the FAA.
In rare cases, the low visibility of the crew will order passengers to shut down their equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that more heavy equipment be safely stored under seats or in a storage space above the head during take-off and landing.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore experience blooming
Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, so she can pay her daughter's tuition.
“We just bought a house with our husband and I put all my money on it,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although every month as an administrator receives $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, family monthly income is insufficient, says.
The demand across areas in south-eastern Asia – where household debt is increasing – is indeed the fact that ValueMax, where a woman is engaged, has become the third installment on the ladder at the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
The halting of jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as secure bank loans.
Stopers in Singapore normally apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4% rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, the stops have the advantage of not requiring the verification of the person (payment history) or of the receipt, and they may provide a loan faster than the banks.
Therefore, millions of people across the region turn to pawnshops because of increasing living costs and growing household and consumer debt.
After five years of massive growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a relaxed monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium income turn to pawnshops to deal with worsening financial situations.
This week, the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency quoted an increasing use of credit in households mainly due to increasing rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of the 80 percent of GDP ranking, which is an increase from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which just got out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the date showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The important thing is that, with rising costs, people from middle to low [income scales] will try to complement their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the Malaysian bank of CIMB.
Historically high prices of gold over the past two years have contributed to the fact that people are quick to stop their personal property and take advantage of the opportunity to change their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 urban pawnshops are gold.
People say, the gold price looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace, and we'll get it back next month.
The largest contractor in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded a 20 % increase in the number of customers using its pawnshop in recent months.
The growth in the development sector is so large that ValueMax, a branch operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbor Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says CEO ValueMax Jo Lee Ching.
The company will finance it by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD that it won this week at the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount creditors found themselves under the fire of high interest criticism, Mrs. Jo says that the pledge offers not only lower rates than the other creditors, but also does not directly increase the debt.
“Customers stop items they already own, and cashing personal property does not increase their household debt,” he says.
In the company, the asset retention is increasingly accepted as a means to secure short-term, secure financing.
Besides, among those using pawnshops, they're not just people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax branch office when they stop the gold rods or Rolex watch, so they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all sorts.
"There are rich individuals who need to borrow for the short time because of their bold business or investment, or small businesses that need help to solve their cash flow problems," says Mrs.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmanian Health
The federal government insists that the $325 million rescue package for the dying health care in Tasmania contain tough conditions to ensure that the government does not lose funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek reported that the Australian Union is making "flaged measures" to reverse the crisis caused by an ageing island population, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The financing for four years was decided following government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package, which, as we believe, will solve the specific problems that the state is facing," said Mrs Plibersek today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million in surgery at the patient's request.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and grey turbulent surgery, will help to eliminate indebtedness.
Money is also available to clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-op care, health specialists training, mental health services and personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the ideas that the leading clinical doctors have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian health system,” said Mrs Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting and registration regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the money from the Australian Union, and inform each month about where additional funding was spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as effectively as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not be useless, "until a real reform will follow in order to establish a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system".
Nevertheless, he praised the government for its response to his request for the rapid assistance that he first raised in dealing with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe that a federal aid package can remove state-of-the-art public health from critical state," said Mr Wilkie.
According to the government, these additional procedures chosen will significantly reverse recent cuts.
The spokesperson of the Federal Opposition in the field of Health Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is just "a patchwork".
“The reason why I am here is that the Labour Government has removed 430 million dollars from our medical system,” he said to ABC TV.
You can't have a government that takes almost half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that pays $300 million, and pretends to be good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that not one dollar of the rescue package is issued to a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicoloux adapted Denise Diderota's novel, which brings an exceptional film expedition and the creation of time, but it is also more boring than it should be.
It dates back to the 1960s in France and tells a gloomy story about Suzanne, a young noble man who is sent to the monastery by his family.
When he rebels, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from a punishable mother introduced and becomes an object of sexual passion for others.
The film never slides to the fury or sleepiness, and that's his problem.
The solemn nature of this story leads viewers to experience torture similar to wearing a leather shirt.
Skiareals want to cheapen families with children
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, said on Thursday, the global control committee for chemical weapons, while violent conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where toxic substances are supposed to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
Notification by the Chemical Weapons Organisation came in the day before 1 November,
the term laid down by the Hague-based organisation Damascus in order to destroy or prevent the operation of all chemical weapons and machinery equipment for mixing chemicals in order to create toxic gas and ammunition.
The completion of this basically initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons by mid-2014 Damascus.
Destroying equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still needs to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is assumed that this country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including yperity and sarin’s nervous gas.
The announcement came on Thursday, when the fights in Safira, which experts refer to as the headquarters of the chemical weapons and storage plant, were announced by the Syrian observer for human rights based in Britain.
A group of activists, which monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria, announced on Thursday that 120 296 people died.
Of which should be 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the government side there are 29 954 members of Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18 678 pro-government fighters and 187 armed men from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Among the killed there are also 2,202 government defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number hasn't been updated since.
The conflict forced about 2 million inhabitants to leave the country.
Assad's troops have fought in Safira against insurgents, many of which have been linked to Al-Qaeda for weeks.
The observer stated on Thursday that the losses were on both sides but did not have specific numbers.
The battles have underlined the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, during their mission, have to deal with close deadlines in the midst of the continuing civil war in Syria to get rid of the chemical arsenal.
The statement from the OPCW, which is close to working with the UN, said that his team is now “satisfying that he checked – and followed the destruction – the Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling”.
He added that "there are currently no other control activities planned".
Previously, this week, the inspectors said that they completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two places because of security concerns.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that these two sites were ‘leaved and ... the items of the chemical weapons programme that contained were moved to two other designated sites which had been checked’.
It was not immediately clear whether the device in Safira was one of the places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
“I am bowing to the courage and bravery that you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission that this organization has ever had,” said the director of observers Ahmet Uzumc in his commentary by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad's government, with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alawite sect, are mainly opposed to the Shia Islam.
As far as other developments are concerned, Chief Observer Ramí Abdul Rahmán said that there was a strong explosion within the air defense device in the Syrian Coastal Province of Lazikija on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Conspiracy over the judgment of the schoolmaster of the bombing on Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the bombing of Bali in 2002 were infuriatingly responding to the judgment of the last schoolmasters who were brought before justice and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for putting together an explosive device that was used in the bombing.
In 15 years, he could be released on parole.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in attacking two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which there were 202 people left dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty in several other points of the prosecution related to terrorism, including a series of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded a life sentence, even though it may have insisted that a man with the nickname “Demolithion Man” (the destroyer) should have received the death penalty because of his reputation as an expert in the production of explosives.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Pertha, who lost her 39 - year - old twins Jane and Jenny during the devastating attack launched by Patek and other schoolmakers almost ten years ago.
She said with tears in her eyes that Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP agency, Mrs Corteen said: "It should be built before the execution squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see other grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari club was compared to the country when a strong load located in an outdoor parked van was set up shortly after October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, he died three times to doctors.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as three other members of the terrorist cell Jamá Islamija responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Mushlas and Imam Samudru – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one.
Keeping him alive... there's just no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others isn't that good.
Patek was court-martialed as the last of Bali's assassins.
The arrest was avoided for almost ten years, but in January 2011, he was captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later the US forces killed the former leader of Al-Qaeda Usama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated in his testimony that the intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect between the terrorist groups from south-eastern Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not volunteer," said Mrs Corteen.
Until now, he has not felt regret for how much grief he has caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"This year we will see a lot of tears," said Mrs Corteen.
Patek may appeal to the judgment.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technological products on aircraft (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices “from gate to gate” – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of the eagerly expected new rules issued by the Federal Air Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
As soon as the change will be implemented according to individual airlines, the FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at the press conference.
Air carriers will have to demonstrate to the FAA how many aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated training manuals for on-board crews and the directive to store facilities in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA claimed that it had already received plans from certain airlines to extend the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already handed over their plans.
" Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic equipment very quickly," the FAA said in its statement.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the plane are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches its altitude of 3 kilometers, and the captain has issued a warrant.
Passengers are expected to shut down their equipment again when the plane drops to land and turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and riding have provided the FAA.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adapted to enable passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
“As soon as the new rules are safely implemented – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success,” she said in her statement Glading.
Frankly, we're tired of being "guards."
However, surfing on the Internet, sending emails and texting or downloading data will continue to be prohibited under 3 kilometres of altitude, said the Agency.
Passengers will be informed to switch their smart phones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with Friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as well known, fired from the American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And harder devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored for fear that they might hurt someone if they flew around the cabin.
Phone calls from mobile phones will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones do not determine the FAA, but the American Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may cancel the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transport Safety, a National Transport Safety Expert at CBS News, said that mobile phones continue to be considered as a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but also from FCC data we know that in the air they can cause interference with the transmission towers," Rosenker said.
In order to examine this problem, the FAA Advisory Committee, last month, proposed that the government allow the wider use of electronic equipment.
In recent years, the FAA has been under pressure to reduce restrictions on its use.
Critics like Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, say there's no legitimate security reason for this ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget even the obligation to shut down their equipment or ignore it.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying FM radios, the technical gain of that time.
New airlines are much more dedicated to electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
Air companies have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at altitudes for several years.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should be adapted under the new rules for the greater use of electronic equipment, said Huertová.
Current electronic equipment generally radiates much less intense radio transmission than was the case with previous generation devices.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimum transmissions when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when the devices download or send data.
Among those who push to release restrictions on the use of these facilities by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the representatives of this company loaded the aircraft with their electronic readers Kindle and carried out a test flight, but no problem appeared.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities present any risks.
Douglas Kidd from the National Air Passenger Association said that he is convinced that interference from these facilities is real even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have stated that there are only fractional reports from pilots to support the fact that such equipment can cause disruption of air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow passengers to shut down their equipment while flying on low visibility devices.
The Group of the tourism industry welcomed these changes and according to them it is a reasonable procedure for the passenger public, which uses the technology to a large extent.
“We are pleased that the FAA has recognised that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the American Travel Association.
The bird was aired from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after he was found exhausted on the oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One quake last month was taken by helicopter to Aberdeen after the Scottish company SPCA had treated him at the rescue center until he was healed.
Colin Seddon’s operational center said: “This quake was likely to have emigrated from northern Europe when it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea. ”
Apparently, he ran out of strength and found refuge on the oil platform.
Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help. ”
At the time of the baptism he was released, he was in good condition and well.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to combine businesses and define what changes in relation to the EU want to see British entrepreneurs and job-makers.
To this end, we have entered into the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views regarding Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing UK companies of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see how the government favours new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than entrenched into a long and strenuous process of reforming European secret institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopolistic regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and businessmen said that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European area of trade – the consent was expressed by even 40 percent of large businesses – traditionally the most pro-European society.
Finally, our business research revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to pursue a change in the contract and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The finding that businesses of different sizes and major business groups have identified shows that the business sector is pushing for a “sensual change” that will bring back influence back to Britain.
There is a great deal at stake – achieving a change in the Treaty and a better agreement for Britain can amount to a profit of up to 16% in voting in the referendum for staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to revise the conditions of British membership in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mean a significant shift from the current balance of power back to Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and, given the way the euro area is moving beyond narrower economic and fiscal union, it is becoming increasingly necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and, as the results of our survey show, this means refocusing on trade and a major change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
John Kerry admitted: The spying went too far!
The United States has sometimes "too far" in spying, admitted according to AFP the head of American diplomacy John Kerry during a video conference between Washington and London.
But, according to the Minister, he served to reverse terrorist attacks.
The first confession from Washington, according to AFP, sounded in the middle of a sharp polemic on both sides of the Atlantic due to a scandalous revelation of a mass data surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), the target of which was also the American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President (Barack Obama) did, some of these events have gone too far and we ensure that it will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he was primarily defending his current practice.
In his opinion, the collection of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations, such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the USA, the assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented aircraft from falling, buildings exploded, and people were killed because we were able to be informed in time of plans," Kerry stressed.
However, he again admitted that collecting information "in some cases went disproportionately far".
The American intelligence affair, which reportedly followed hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.

Alexei Miller from Gazprom says that the pipes in Bulgaria are launching a new gas era
Opening the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means launching one of the largest European energy projects, said Director Gazprom.
“Today we are witnessing the gap: the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria, the largest and most important project in Europe,” said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream line should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, says officials.
Miller says that direct links to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "perpetually" removed.
Once the whole project has started operations in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says that the construction is to start at the end of this year in other countries.
The gas pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2,2 trillion cube feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
The decisive battle awaits them.
The Lebanon Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous region of Kalamun.
According to the ever-intentional reports of Israel on Wednesday's raids to two places in Western Syria, he destroyed the missiles intended for Hezbollah.
This Lebanese Shia organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its agenda is also a fight against Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but has clearly stated that it will prevent the transfer of arms to Hezbollah's hands in Lebanon.
The reports on Wednesday’s raids at the weapons warehouses in Western Syria are still being clarified.
Israel did not comment, but it was confirmed by American resources.
According to the Syrian web site Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean region of the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabel hit south of Latakía.
Al-Arabija News Station claims that there were two warehouses in which the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, the missiles of the Russian production SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but the military analyst Ron ben Jishai said that Syria continuously tries to supply Hezbollah with missiles and Syrian air force teaches members of the armed section of Hezbollah with missiles.
SA-8 are outdated missiles that the Syrian army has since the 1980s.
They're located on a moving chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, it is easy to hide thanks to mobility and small dimensions.
They're equipped with radar, which, however, shuts down after firing the missile, so it's hard to lock them down.
Latakía lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling alavates.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in Western Syria in the past.
He claims to help protect the Syrian Shia community, which the avalanche belongs to.
Now reportedly 15,000 of his fighters are ready to help conquer the Army back of Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army also strengthens its troops there.
Kalamún lies between Damascus and the third largest city of Homs.
The battle, according to the source of al-Arabija, is to be retaliated for the recent attack of the opposition to the Syrian Shiite Brigadier Abu Fadla Abbás in Shia, Damascus.
Hezbollah helped this year the Syrian army fight back the town of Kusajr at the Lebanese border.
Many insurgents from Kusajr just left for Kalamun.
More recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
The reasons were corruption, money dumping for overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases, and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the results of the elections, it can be pointed out that most citizens had this status.
That they didn't mind, and the state that was here (theft and indebtedness of this state) was actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I can't explain that 3 413 497 voters did not come to the elections, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted by ODS in total, i.e. 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is an over-the-counter majority.
When I add 1 016 829 to the above-mentioned parties ČSSD voters, the old order (because all of the above parties participated in "theft" and indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of the rightful voters actually agreed with this state.
In fact, the majority of the voters have shown that they are not in a position to punish the culprits of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who were involved in this were the right laws?
Is he even helping us?

The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Christian association of young men (YMCA) were charged with complaints against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Committee on Sexual Abuse of Children has learned that, before the charges were brought against child abuser Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian association of young men (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse of children.
But in front of the committee, it was said that in its opening statement to the Commission, this association stated that they had never dealt with a case of sexual abuse in their organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked when one of YMCA's employees was accused of offences related to child pornography, and others, when a gym teacher in Caringbah of the YMCA association was sentenced in 1991 for sexual harassment of children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the advisor to the committee, that he knew about the first case, but not the other one.
He admitted that the initial statement of YMCA was also inaccurate when it indicated that external audits were carried out in the YMCA, which had been valued as a leading advocate of the rights of children.
The evidence submitted by the Commission is that YMCA received the second lowest of four possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society of August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA association when he was 21, admitted that the downward leadership of the YMCA had failed in its own direction when Mr. Lord had adopted without ensuring that the staff were aware of the obligation to notify their child safety rules.
Previously, this year, Lord was sentenced to being sexually harassed by 12 boys who he committed during the two years he worked in the YMCA association.
He's been trapped for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare refused to claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that prevented the staff from reporting child safety violations to Mr. Lord.
The members of the staff provided evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including that the Lord was alone with the children, privately watching them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them that he liked them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, a subordinate to the Lord's training for child safety because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of the YMCA association in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to about something."
The Director-General said that he did not accept the evidence of staff that they felt unwitting if they should contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord has clouded their judgment, and that's why they didn't report the problem.
Mr Hare said that the Board of YMCA in New South Wales had given his opinion that the lesson from Jonathan Lord's case for the organization was that the staff “did not give any report,” and that the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to let the staff sign the confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges appeared, he made a general manager of child services at YMCA Liam Whitley's organization.
He said that the goal was to avoid infringing evidence, but it was "excessively zealous" and wrong-doing.
A child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smllbone of Griffith University told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that would be safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said that there were serious problems in recruiting, checking, working, training and running staff.
The hearing was postponed on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the Prime Minister's post, but he admitted that return was unlikely.
In a night interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, 59-year-old politicians expressed their views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when Mr Blair resigned ten years later, he mostly avoided British policy talks and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador to the Bizekkodkodnemním náměstí quartet.
When asked whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his answer to London’s Evening Standard newspaper was as follows: “Yes, of course, but it may be hard to say that, so...
While a crowd of experts gathered in Cardiff to show horses to fight for the Horse of the Year, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he doesn't go to school yet and only a few months ago he made his first steps, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland Pony Toffee, smoothly cursed three wheels to finally win the main prize and left 30 towing adult opponents behind.
This inseparable pair – with the same height – was praised for its appearance, behaviour and style at the Sunnybank riding centre in the village of Rudra near Cardiff.
He stood up against the masters and the ladies in elegant hats, put his barrel in a merry angle and let his two-year-old Toffee dwell around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to control horses far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest grades for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given to his third birthday in March and has been practicing daily with this Shetland Pony.
His mother Donna (30) said: "Fenton and Toffee work together perfectly."
They did not have great hope, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone considered him phenomenal, and strangers wanted to take pictures of him.
The boy from Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
“ There was an exciting atmosphere, ” says Mrs. Howells, “and everyone was cheering and applauding. ”
He ran through the sand throughout the arena and even though he was so small, he gave great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farm and has taken care of two chickens.
As he began, he'll soon be at the Horse of the Year competition, and I'm sure he'll be fine.
The spokesman of the annual horse show competition said: “The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control the pony.”
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they performed in the competition circuit.
They always watch how good teamwork is between the ponies and who guides him – and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton had some cute clothes for him, and he really fell in there with him.
Too many curious newspapers to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which requested the release of a reporter accused of slander, will be thoroughly investigated, said the press administrator.
The newspaper New Express, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public application for release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on TV that he was taking bribes to come up with stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The administrator said that the New Express newspaper will now perform a "full remedy".
The Regulation came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Kuang-tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper from the Yangcheng Group of Evening News published some false reports about Zoomlion.
“New Express’s editorial management was unsettled,” said the administrator in his statement.
He said that he had to decide "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of cancellation of a journalistic licence".
In addition, he "directed the Yangcheng Group of Evening News to complete a complete repair of the New Express letter and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express letter".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express that concerned financial irregularities in a company with building equipment called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, his newspaper issued two applications for his release on the front page and claimed to be worth his journalistic work.
However, Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and confessed that he had spent false stories in bribery.
“In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion, as well as to the entire media sector, and its ability to gain public confidence,” he said at the State Intelligence Station of CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was looking out for money and glory.
I realize I acted badly.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he issued a letter of New Express on the cover of an apology that said he failed when he failed to control his reports.
Recently, several closely watched suspects have made a television confession.
Experts say that the confessions are still being enforced on a regular basis, irrespective of the amendment of this year's law, which prohibits the authorities from forcing anyone to charge themselves.
A tunnel was found for drug trafficking between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railway
It managed to discover one of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the US and Mexico, supplemented with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel of about one meter [1 m] in size as one of the most sophisticated secret corridors they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which moves to the length of almost six football courses, connects a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses where trucks can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
The authorities stated that the tunnel was closed before the drugs could have been transported unnoticed.
The authorities, along with the discovery of the tunnel, also arrested eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to the court records.
Three men who worked as drivers according to the authorities were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute.
In the case of convictions, prison sentences from 10 years to a life sentence.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate extensive draining channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico, which in front of drug cartels raises a problem as quickly as possible to get its product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor in the length of some 650 metres equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Centre connect management.
For example, they offer joint advertising
A new integrated newsroom of Economics in Prague, Karlín.
Economia has taken another step towards transforming the Centre holding into its media house.
From Friday, Economics and the Centre have shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishers into the common media house," comments Kamil Čermák, Vice-President of the Economics Board, and the commissioned Director-General.
Čermak, who will be at the forefront of the single management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Andreas Demuth Centre.
Pavel Vopařil, a new joint director of trade, was appointed, under the authority of both Zuzana Tylčerová.
Stephen Burd became the new chief of information technology.
The joint director of the editors is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team is also director for the transformation of Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pitts was a newly established marketing director.
The department of corporate communication is now under Věra Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishers leads Petr Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will allow us to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, better linking the content of all the titles issued and, last but not least, make the company's business management more efficient," Čermák added.
The company Economia, owned by the financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a contract to purchase the Centre Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of this April.
The portfolio of the Centre Holdings consists of servers Aktuò.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands of Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najeso or portfolio of nearly two dozen other smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of the Economy Newspapers, IHNED.cz news server, weeklys Respekt and Economics and the amount of printed and Internet B2B titles.
Among the Czech publishers is the most successful in selling digital versions of their main titles.
This June the publisher moved to the newly built modern space in Prague Karlín.
CME is targeting television business.
They'll release almost a quarter of the people.
The media group CME will release.
By the end of the year, he wants to make up thousands of people.
A section intends all the side-actions and it only wants to focus on its main business, the television broadcast.
The group, which owns TV Nova in the Czech Republic and is also active in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs approximately 4,500 people in total.
That's how almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is the company CET 21, which holds a licence for television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will be touched by the Czech Republic, where the group employs approximately 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV leader, TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"This is premature, and we cannot really comment on it," said the Director of Communication Novy Josef Koukolček.
According to information from MF DNES, the significant release of the Czech Republic is certainly not avoided, but this should have the greatest impact on the personnel status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both the new bosses of the Novy Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined the long-standing director Adrian Sarbu during the Wednesday conference with analysts, spoke about how they wanted to limit all activities that were directly unrelated to television business.
It is therefore likely that it will significantly reduce the cost of producing its own programmes, filming and production activities.
In the industrial premises of ČKD in Prague, a cooling tower burned at night
In the industrial premises of ČKD in Prague, a large capacity store was burned, according to firemen apparently a cooling tower.
"The firemen were on their way to the fire on Thursday, 11 o'clock in the evening, and the fire was still on fire this morning," said the spokesman of Prague firemen Pavlín Adamc.
The amount of pollutants in the air in the surrounding area according to the measurements did not exceed the permitted limits.
The levels of damage and the causes of the fire are unknown so far.
About five dozen firemen arrived at Kolben Street.
"This is a fire of a large capacity tank, probably a cooling tower," said Adamc.
"There is no functional hydrant network on the premises, so we are using the transport line from the tanks," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, it complicated the extinguishing of a poorly functioning hydrants network, so the firemen had to deliver the water from elsewhere.
Fire commander has declared second degree fire alarm.
There are four levels, the fourth is declared in the most serious situations.
Chemicals went to the scene to verify the level of hazardous substances that could have gotten into the air during the fire.
"But they did not measure in the air the amount of harmful material that would exceed the hygiene standards," the spokesman said.
The British police delivered Assange's release notice
The British police today delivered a release notice to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard declared that he had provided a 40-year-old Australan with a "notification notice" asking him to come to the police station and that if he didn't do so, he could be threatened with arrest.
Assange, under the British law, exhausted his options when the Supreme Court repealed his appeal this month against the issue, thus facing the extradition to Sweden for sexual charges.
Since he was afraid Stockholm would release him to the US, he sought refuge on June 19 at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard “made a notice of the release of a 40-year-old man asking him to come to the police station on the day and hour that he was designated,” said the spokesman.
Assange is still violating the terms of bail.
The Embassy has refused to comment on the delivery of the notice of issue.
Assange is afraid that he will be released from Sweden to the United States, where he can face the charges of espionage, because on the WikiLeaks website he published 250 000 U.S. diplomatic documents.
Driver got a £1,000 fine for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist received a £1,000 fine for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree, Essex, was seen in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found out he had a drink cup between his thighs.
At Colchester Howie's police court, he confessed to the charge that he was running carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay for the cost of £90 and the premium for the accused £100.
As a result of the tax on owners of foreign real estate, the London bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the proceeds of financial assets, but awaits Mr Osborn's final decision, which in the 2012 budget introduced a charge of 7 % for the real estate transfer for buildings at a price above 2 million pounds and annual charges for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
The proceeds from the payment for the transfer of real estate in the housing fund in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which in the tax year 2012/13 reached 708 million pounds, already exceeding the total sum for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Cook said: “In view of the increase in real estate transfer at home of high value and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that high value assets are little taxed regardless of the effect of the outdated system of tax on the head.”
He added that “this step may have made some foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London, or that existing owners were reluctant to sell.”
The leading properties – 5 % to 10 % of the housing market according to price – in a rich belt reaching from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded an increase of 11,8 % last year.
The prices in central London continue to show a steady growth of 5.6% year after year, but were overshadowed by a thriving “home market” in which according to the Savills property survey, the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the increase.
Scientists have explained how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Previous research has shown that happy dogs drill their tail more right (from a dog's point of view) while nervous dogs have their tails largely left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can record and react to these fine differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Valortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are different from those that cause positive or negative emotions. ”
We tried to detect the same with other species.
He added that, as in humans, even in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information about how dogs react to the unsustainable drilling of the tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analysed their behaviour.
It may not take long for us to understand why their tails sometimes go on one side, and another to the other.
Professor Valortigara said: “We have shown dogs films about dogs – whether in a natural version or in the form of silhouette – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we have also managed to adjust the movement of the tail and to illustrate it more right or left.”
When animals saw otherwise unremarkable dog move the tail right (from the point of view of the dog drilling the tail), they remained perfectly calm.
However, when she recorded tail-painting mainly to the left (renewed from the look of the dog drilling the tail), their heart rate increased and the animals acted uncertainly.
Professor Vallortigara said that he does not think that dogs will communicate consciously through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs learned from the experience that movements must and may not be careful of.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and move their tails in one direction, it is repeatedly connected to friendly behavior and movement of traffic yields less friendly behavior, you will react based on this experience. ”
Scientists say that findings can help dog owners, vets and trainers to understand the emotions of their animals better.
Specialist in dog behaviour John Bradshaw, a university teacher at the University of Bristol, said it wasn't the first study to investigate whether the left and right side of the dog care center was important.
Last year, the Lincoln University team found out that dogs turn their heads on the left when they watch an aggressive dog, and on the right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another professional treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “With a dog robot, dogs were more likely to meet when he drilled the tail left than the right, when they became more uncertain – the opposite of the Italian study.”
According to him, the difference can be given by dogs in these different studies of animals in movies or dog robots did not appear quite like dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
“In the case of many different mammals, there are strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for various purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are not an exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it may not take long to understand why their tails sometimes go on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkeys moved a concert in Glasgow for Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved the concert in Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with larynitis.
The Sheffield group was supposed to perform on Friday at the town complex Hydro.
Alex Turner's main singer's disease, however, forced her to move her performance.
The announcement of the group came after having similarly been forced to postpone the Thursday performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys says: “After the decision to postpone today’s performance in the LG Arena in Birmingham and on the basis of a medical recommendation, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1 November.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately he will not be able to get out."
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will be held on 20 November and the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets to these performances shall remain valid.
We would like to apologize to everyone who bought the tickets for the inconvenience that caused them.
If you need more information, please contact the customer service at the cash register where you bought your tickets.
Pope Francis named the first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis first named the new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February.
Cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church immediately after the Pope and are those who vote for the Pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help select his successor.
Now it's 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, the Pope's election cannot be taken anymore, the group is reduced to 120 election cardinals.
In a statement that announces this report, the fifth Friday to Federico Lombardi, the spokesperson of the Vatican, said that before the solemn promotion of the new cardinals will be held the assembly of the current cardinals known as the Consistor.
"Papež František has decided to give his decision to convene the February Constituent in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices letter said the number of election cardinals is likely to drop by February.
He said that the Pope usually named as many cardinals as needed to increase the number of voters to 120, and as many cardinals as over the age of 80 as he wanted.
The consortium next year will be significant because it will be the first one after Francis was elected in March this year, said Valero.
At the moment, there is some orientation on Europe and, above all, Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis appointed the Cardinals' Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope has made all his own decisions.
"Now Francis chose these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said it was possible that these cardinals would ask for advice.
In this situation, however, we were not – it is a complete news.
Valero said that Popes traditionally promoted bishops from large places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is "full surprise – so we don't know who he is."
GM downloads some new light trucks in the US to repair seat backrests
According to a Friday notification from the U.S. Car Safety Authority, General Motors is downloading nearly 19 000 of its new (2014) light lorries Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to correct the failure with manual latching of the backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the mechanism of tilting the front seats may have a failure.
As a result, seat backs are not in conformity with the federal car safety standards for head restraints.
The notification on the NHTSA website states that “if the vehicle gets hit from behind, the passenger head restraint may not properly protect the passenger, which increases the risk of an accident”.
The downloaded models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
GM marketed the delivery in June and the most important placing of vehicles on the market from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the delivery of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the announcements to owners due to the 16-day failure of the government, which weakened the growth of car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra supplies, which were revised for the 2014 models, increased to around 20 % during the first 10 months of this year, on Friday GM declared.
In October GM sold 42 660 Silverado models and 16 503 Sierra models.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to 37.47 USD.

When I finish my patient reviews tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and expressed your breath.
The elections ended with an overwhelming advantage and the television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept the newspapers they got.
A young visionary team headed into the White House and the nation was ready for a change.
During the introduction to the Authority in 2008, Obama had an aid of 82 percent.
And this is where I close the book.
To go to the present is a rough awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It is hard to recall these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of wasted opportunities.
In years after I entered my first election ticket, there were really changes.
It wasn't anything I imagined.
I acknowledge Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse successes – from the Act on Available Care through the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy "for no question, do not say anything" after the murder of Usama bin Laden.
Moreover, I am convinced that the party's obstruction has reversed our nation's efforts to move forward: immigration reform among other things, the possibility of the public to choose health care and closure of the Guantanam base.
But after many situations where I have defended Obama's administration from my colleagues, I have reached an absolute limit in terms of explanations that they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
Constructions of Republicans cannot explain their consent to listening to foreign leaders or to raids of unmanned aircraft that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot be explained by the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans, nor by the fact that they are persecuting those who expose the government's misrepresentation.
They cannot be held responsible for execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without proper court, or for restricting public contributions and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
They cannot be justified by finding a message that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... from the Nixon administration".
And most recently they can't even excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the Act on available care of a simple website.
I don't know if there's anything to be expected of.
Whether I had any idea at 18 that government power might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded her.
The free function clearly does not have any predictable course and our public talks will form an opposition political party and accidental events such as the massacre in Newton.
However, all the examples that I have set out above seem to be largely the result of the administration’s own decision.
And that's what bothers me most.
I voted for both again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unbroken alternative and seemed to be unable to strengthen his policy and position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, freed from the pressures of the next elections, would fill the hopes we once heard of.
Nevertheless, the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
They make me remember the many promises that have gone missing.
This week, I read a chapter on how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton during the primarys in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that they had to get back to the pace and remain faithful to their mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest for the parental leave programme
The Billionary and Member of Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict with interests over the parental leave program, because his daughters can become pregnant and benefit from it.
Bánský magnate, which led to a dispute over the payment of a $6 million tax burden on coal, made this claim when he tried to put the question on the table whether he was in conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Chamber, which can play a crucial role in deciding whether coal taxes and mining activities are to be collected.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, and he added that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit personally from a given policy.
“He got into a major conflict of interest as regards paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters were pregnant, he would be directly interested in getting a parental leave,” said Mr Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral committee officially declared Mr Palmer a winner in the fight for a chair for the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast area due to 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for the electoral results to be reviewed to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closing of the electoral rooms?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately and have the results at 7:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark voting tickets.
Is it that the results can be erased if anyone doesn't like them?
These days and these days, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The electoral committee has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and has recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political agenda also applies to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
The Public Office is a public service.
“We are seeking no reward except that we can serve society at this critical time,” he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found out that washing your hands will change you and the power.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two had the task of solving an unresolved role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed her hands after failure was much more optimistic than the one where her participants didn't wash their hands.
Also, the "washed hands" group did better in the next test than the other one.
Yet, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who had not washed them.
The results of "washed" were at the level of the third group whose participants did not notice any previous failure.
According to psychologists, physical purity removes truly negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, the motivations are falling, the testing must be much more focused in the next tests.
If we were to transfer the research results to Bohemia, we would probably be the most optimistic when we came back from the toilet.
After use of the toilet does not wash hands only one percent of the Czechs and Czechs, but on the way through the city transport it is already a fifth.
Most of them cling to hygiene after work in the garden or in a workshop where 85 percent of the people wash their hands.
The absorption of a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after hand is given to a stranger.
In this situation, the hands will wash 28.8 percent of the Czechs and 40.3 percent of the Slovaks.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be in place, I'm afraid that reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," commented Dr. Claudie Komárková.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two known persons, the situation is suspended by the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) two traders in their foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by control authorities concerning suspected monetary market machinations is becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities to investigate the largest financial market in the world, where they change the owners of 5.3 trillion USD every day.
The mention of two traders would be the first employees of the RBS suspended in the context of an expanding investigation, which responds to the LIBOR rate manipulation scandal (london interbank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment, but confirmed that this month it received a request from the authorities for information.
“Our unscrupulous search continues in this matter and we work fully with the FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to this event reported that the RBS had forwarded records of e-mails and rapid messages to the British Financial Office sent from accounts and accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position as European Foreign Exchange Chairman at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European President of Cash Trading in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither one of these traders has been charged with any offense.
Mr. Usher's group for sending fast messages were bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said people who were engaged in this event.
This week, the Bank of UBS stated that, after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced that it had investigated the suspicious machine in the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, it had taken steps against one of its employees.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antimonopolitan Authority Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the United States and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong – are examining the claim that these bankers have agreed to move with the monetary market.
In addition, people familiarizing with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse initiated an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are sifting through years of old with fast messages and e-mails to track down cases of misdemeanors.
The investigation reports have alarmed traders in the area, which was one of the largest engines for making profits in the closures of investment banks in recent years, but which has been disturbed by the fact that small currency volatility has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation when they claimed that with a large and highly liquid foreign currency market it is basically impossible to manipulate, but high-level traders say that it does not necessarily have to be true.
The high-rise trader said that, despite the considerable volume of daily foreign exchange in liquidity fragmentation between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms, "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had released almost USD 6 million from its share trading department this week, which caused a loss of USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the competent authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
“We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been resolved,” said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded 1,000
Doctors in Prague have registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the follow-up in 1986 to the end of this third quarter, the tests confirmed the disease for a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
It comes from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, 2,063 have been infected throughout the Czech Republic.
Immunity failure has already erupted in 396.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic is growing annually in the last decade.
In 2002, the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later it was 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new diseases and in 2010 180.
Last year, however, the number dropped to 153, last year was record-breaking.
According to the lab, there were 212 of them.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200, which I think is no longer a doubt," says the AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavátý, who has led the Prague House of Light for Patients for Years.
From October to the end of 2011 the tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, said the Head.
In September, doctors recorded 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September HIV tests confirmed 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS disease occurred in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to get to know a town should go to a cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through a citizen's centre with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would reveal to a Bedeco.
Many people "read from graves".
The cemeterys slowly roam and gain an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities such as faiths, how big and coherent families belong to what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, their taste.
And from the condition of the graves they will find out how the dead take care of their lives.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Act
The Supreme Court in the United States has decided that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is consistent with the Constitution, a fundamental victory for Obama's administration.
Based on the 5:4 vote, the court held that the individual regulation of the Act on the Protection of Patients and Available Care – which it orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise threatens to pay a fine – it does not resist the Constitution on the basis of government tax jurisdiction.
The President of the court, John Roberts, stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining part of the Law on 2700 pages and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which requires States to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have filed an action to block this law.
During the 2012 primary year, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the envisaged candidate Mitt Romney.
The words "Mugabe Is a Round donkey" no longer threatens to be in prison, the court's law is over
Until now, the Zimbabweans had to pay good attention to the public talking about the nine and eighty - year - old Mugab, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, since the end of 1987, has been at its forefront.
According to paragraph 33 of the Penal Code, a fine of $100 to one year's imprisonment was a threat to the President's Office's abuse.
"The national representatives should not be keenly accusing people who comment on the President in pubs or other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court declared.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the decision of the court, the UK BBC has informed them.
A number of damaged Zimbabwans, among them Tendai Dang, who were arrested by the police two years ago for an alleged insult to the president in an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May he ended up in prison a opposition activist, frequenting Mugabe's public advising him with a "culse donkey".
In August, the prosecutor accused a 26-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The Court also declared that there is an anti-legislative law restricting freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be false," said the Deputy Minister of Justice, Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law has enabled a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to twenty years of prison time.
"The existence of a law allowing the criminalisation of someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to freely express themselves," said Malala.
Notwithstanding the fact that Mugabe has held the country for over 33 years, it has adopted a new constitution based on a referendum with wider civil freedoms.
Small steps away from the dictatorship of one man the country entered into in 2009, when the agreement between Mugab and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangiraj to the Prime Minister's chair.
However, the country continues to suffer from an economic crisis and until 2008, the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100 000 percent.
In 2009, therefore, the government completely abolished the national currency.
In Zimbabwe today, only currencies of other countries apply.
The impoverished economy is going to Mugabe's indiscreet agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
But most of them had no experience running the farm.
Central banks hold swap lines permanently
The temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument enabling banks to access global currencies whenever they need them.
The banks have stated it in their joint statement.
"It is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the leading international economist of London Bank Barclays.
"In the meantime, all of the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not in my opinion any surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, the Chief Economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers strengthen the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market first crushed.
Central banks' agreements have allowed access to the euro, dollars and other currencies of anyone who needed them.
Central bankers' decisions come at a time when the US Fed is preparing to complete its program to support the American economy, which could avoid the price of money on the global market even higher.
The Swap contract is used as a standard to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency in the current liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be understood as the repository of one currency and the borrowing of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) erases personal data.
Over a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz.
But I didn't finish it later, because someone who couldn't finish the Internet registration at the branch office was just sitting there.
And since I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration went down, and then I moved in, and that changed my address and my identity card number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told I couldn't do it because I had another OP number, an address, and that I just couldn't finish it and that I had to ask for data deletion and make a new registration.
So I did that and 24.10.2013 I wrote on technical support that I am asking for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
On that long day, she wrote the technical support that I should register at the branch office.
Thus began a marathon of e-mails for technical support, where after 4th urgans 25.10. they wrote that they deleted personal data at my request.
So you would think that you could make the new registration, and here again the problems began to occur to me first it wrote that my username was already occupied (the concept was not deleted - it is not personal data, but eventually disabled this).
So I used a different user name and jumped at me that my personal data had already been stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have something they claim to have deleted?), so I again contacted the technical support.
When I asked how it was possible to write down that personal data really deleted 25.10. and to send an e-mail with the error.
I did that (at around 15 o'clock yesterday) and they wrote to me today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that is why I cannot because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I've been in contact with technical support for a week now and I've been dealing with them that they can't.
What about the fact that if it was true what claims (as it is not) no one with the same name or the same date of birth could register if this is already registered.
By the way, I actually registered in those 13.22s, on the same name and date of birth, but I used an imaginary e-mail and a number and the world of wonders, there appeared to me a page that sent me a link to my e-mail to complete the registration.
But how is it possible when you cannot register with the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds the registration to an e-mail and phone number and just didn't disable the data as he claimed.
So again, I've told this technical support that they're just lying (be deliberately and don't know what they're writing) because what they're writing is not true.
I have demonstrated several screens that the registration problem was before 31.10 so the "false" registration doesn't simply affect this.
Tipsport wrote me a sharp sentence - I'm sorry, but by being re-registered, we can't verify your claims.
And the communication ended.
Respective repeats the same sentence over and over again that registration is bound to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and so it didn't actually take place.
So if I summarize it, Tipsport not only did he not erase the data as he claims, but he's still lying when he claims otherwise.
The worse it is that it is easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the error is on the client's side.
By the way, following the introduction of this matter on my personal blog, things got a little bit moving and the technical support came an e-mail that the matter was handed over for examination and I would be informed (after a week of urgenities and arguing and warning of the same mistake).
Music plays in the subway on the Bridge
Transport firm h.m. (DPP) Prague launched the music project in the metro.
The first vestibule, where continuously reproduced instrumental music plays during the subway operation, is the Bridge of Line A on the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double, band and three singers
Textist Michal Horáček brought his new Czech calendar to the hall of Kolínské Městského důměstí, but especially in the programme Among us the singers Lenka Novo, František Ségrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by the excellent Orchestra Matěj Benka.
After the intru and acting etude about the late musician Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of the last time they played in Cologne and the theatre and the electric current fell out throughout the city.
"Otherwise in Cologne, two kinds of cards were made, with which I came into contact," he recalled.
He also reminded President Zeman's native.
"Maybe we could do a tour of the Zákolans or Dúbravce in Bratislava," he joked about other presidents' family places.
A few times per night, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and, if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical work.
The calendar was also made by Josef Manes, who put it on the clock, about ice hockey, but at that time he had no idea how we would meet on the squares and who did not jump is not Czech.
That's the name of one song from the Czech Calendar, but we're not playing it here tonight," he entertained.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang for him a very good night's sleep, singing at night and accompanied him to the guitar.
Otherwise, unless he sang, he played percussion, all three singers then accompanied the band composed of keyboard, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang a little scrotum to the heart, which immediately blew up the auditorium.
"I am glad that the song was interesting to you, which did not surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček responded.
After the recollection of Petr Hapek, I recognize in the presentation by František Ségrad, in the original by Richard Müller awarded with a huge applause, Hana Hegerová again remembered the composition Dad liked Lída Baarová and the Horáčková explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baar's American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb again recalled the song Sebastián, and Ségrado sang a beautiful song from Prague by Jarda Svoboda, a sad native and former Kolínák.
But that was already the conclusion, applause in standings and additions in the form of an optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
One more addition was prepared for the playlist, but the fans didn't cheer up anymore.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire four seats were placed behind the table to sign not only the Czech Calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček's books and even the packaging from the legendary LP, and with any interested parties she also took pictures.
Berdycha and Štěpánek will be complemented by Rosol and Hájek
At the finale of Davis' Cup against Serbia was nominated by the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navrátil four to Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech trophy representatives are defending, but they are going to play on the field of the opponent to the Belarusian arena, where the match will take place on the hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
In the finals, Czechs are the third time in the last five years.
"We know we're going to the hot ground, it's going to be wild, and we need to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with one goal - win three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, the winner of the winning point in last year's finale with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bomb Syria.
U.S. Commandant in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Gulf.
The Israelis have demonstrated exactly what the bombardment of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary humbuk, threat, and millions of statements they sent planes, they hit the target and came back.
Without letting themselves be engulfed by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of confused and large-scale, acts of unreserved Obama's Syrian politics.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't let the media fool you with their claims that the Syrian base was bombed or "deliveries for Hezbalah".
I've recently written about the fact that while helping the U.S. secular insurgents in the country remains only on the rhetorical plane, Russia happily supplies Syria's weapons.
And just a fresh shipment of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latakija has become the target of an Israeli air raid.
Clear message.
And notice, Israel bombed Assad's regime again, not the insurgents, although it should be the opposite according to popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government has awarded 2 members of the spatial forces, probably Delta force.
It wasn't known until now that they stood out during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
There is a known heroic death of two former SEALs who were defending the CIA site in the city, and I think it was members of the CIA secret commando, which was formed by former soldiers.
It's been a long time to speculate what SEALs were doing at the consulate or even elsewhere located in the CIA residence.
It's clearer now.
In any event, information that the CIA has its office protected by machine guns (almost on one of the SEALs members perished after a minor hit) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising are the information about the two still unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. commando in Tripoli, and as soon as they received a report on the attack in Bengazi voluntarily volunteered to intervene and, along with five private contractors, they shot their way to the CIA site in Bengazi.
Obama's administration is embracing the fact that during the attack, the commanding officer was officially and whole and that it was simply hesitated to do so.
Commander, without orders, he'll probably release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that they operate not in the country at one time, but permanently American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors are quite interesting information.
And that's because until recently, nothing like this has officially been admitted, and even now it's just some kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's a good thing that the United States is trying half the time to fight terrorism in Libya.
Even though it would take much more help to solve the national situation.
The last secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It's not so long ago that the media almost sang Iranian air forces for prosecution of American drones.
But it is little known how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to discover your drone in airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
However, if Iranian drones are discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was persecuting an American drone in an international sea space when perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history occurred.
The guy flew up the Phantom to opt-in on his armor, without the Phantom registering it on the radar, or he just noticed it, and then, when he suddenly showed up at his place and called on the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened to it unreputedly.
It is no wonder that the Phantom is an aircraft of American production, but it remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare to Raptor.
We want to show Plzeň can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful lately, the defender or backupr Viktorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has the form that brought him back to his representation after a year.
He's got a shot, he's rotting, he's got a fine kick on him after the procedure.
Viktoria reached out in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice after victory, but in the end, one point took from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes his team in a fight with Jablonca will break an unpleasant series.
We want to show that we know how to win.
"I believe that we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is preparing for a tough game with North Bohemia, who are playing football, and is preparing carefully.
Everything is heading towards the game with Jablonca, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the game opponent.
"I believe it will be a great game on Friday night," attracts Czech fans to the Doosan Arena grandstands.
The last reptiles didn't come out as she wanted, but Victoria's defenseman rejects the word of the crisis.
That's how football goes, sometimes you're in good shape, and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis at all.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," says the defender of the West Creatures.
The Viktoria team will once again rely on support for the fans.
"He's playing Friday night and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them the victory," says Rajtoral.
Jana Péťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, it's a big jump - a jump a few years back, and it's into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash dishes, deluxe and do your homework.
Although these "compulsory" things were mostly just theories, parents' wishes.
The practice was completely different - running from school, throwing a bag into the corner and running out.
Play ball games with other kids, jump a shot.
Then on the TV show Helena and her boys sew up the gallows tablecloth for Grandma's birthday.
And then after several warnings wash the dishes at last, deluxe them, in the winter to apply wood to the tiles and tasks to do until dark below the lamp (or rely on the classmate and instead of the tasks to write the in love lines addressed to school love).
In the morning to have breakfast homemade strawberry marmalade (from real fruit, not those jams that sell now, whose contents beside strawberries and did not lie) and drink it with tea from dried herbs, which my mom and I were so happy to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when the grave silence was in the room when my sister and I recorded radio songs for tapes that were loudly filmed in the old tape recorder after my mom.
And then on the pencil, we'd do the tapes and play the same song over and over and over again, our favorite one, and they'd toast it with a siphon.
Or we telephoned through the table using cans that were tied together with a string - and while we were on the phone to get better heard, it was necessary to thoroughly clean your ears, then the tendon was match + watts.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents managed to live it so that we didn't miss it.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads or even cell phones or laptops or branded clothes.
The clothes were inherited from generation to generation and the best "circle" to the wardrobe was a baticed shirt of home production with the help of SAVA.
From electronics, we had enough to please the mentioned mom's tape recorder and, at most, Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which we used by the way only on the train on the school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hop or Man's hat, don't be angry, or how I already said to go "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, I'm sure his parents were saving up for him for a long time, but unfortunately he hasn't warmed up for a long time.
My little sister used to stick a splatter in him, said he'd stomp those tapes so beautifully, so she tried to see if he'd been sleeping.
Unfortunately, he was asleep, but it was his last bite.
Well, he still has this incident, poor guy, on his dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she was snuffed into a video and thought she'd play a recipe and she wouldn't play it, which is why she still can't cook it.
I remember how we all managed to communicate, make arrangements without a cell phone, computers.
My sister and I agreed on holiday with my grandmother's neighbor's granddaughter, when we'd meet again next summer at grandma's - and that's how it was, so it was true.
We met.
Now promise someone you'll see in a year!!
I also remember the winter when the whole village and I were running outside, building snowmen, riding a snowy hill by the church in bags stuffed with hay.
Then my family and I had dinner and talked about the last day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear that notorious sentence before every dinner: "Let's wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have soap attached to the tap in the lemon net in your bathroom.
After dinner, when my dad was working in the garage with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay on the floor, leaned on the duck stove, opened the door, and watched the flames, and listened to the wood cracking, which from the stone rope.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through different chats, text messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew much more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially if I complete these memories by looking at the albums, where they are closely glued by black and white images.
And if I didn't know how old I was then, from the back of the photo, it's always written a year to take a picture.
I'm looking at the fact that, although the cut-up according to the pot didn't look very good and we had two bigger pants after our cousin, no one had laughed before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd better get back to the reality of that step.
Until 2013, and I will wait for what modern times will come up with, for example, once for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me are now for a young teen generation at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they're losing a lot of it, that they won't experience this "pre-opic" time either.
I wish they had!
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being sued for Nortel's patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents lost by Nortel, filed a patent infringement action against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, a company which it overrated during the auction within Nortel’s bankruptcy.
The Rockstar company, which purchased Nortel's $4.5 billion patents, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations at the United States District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps to combine the terms sought on the Internet with the relevant advertising, states the action, which is the core of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately captured.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that work on Google Android’s operating system, which strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a starting price offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the Nortel patent fight, Google won Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partially motivated by Motorola's patent group.
“In spite of the failure to obtain patents which are the subject of the dispute in the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate patents,” says the plaintiff.
Rockstar is seeking increased compensation from Google because it claims that there is a breach of the patent by Google intentionally, as the plaintiff claims.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
She came from outside, out of four degrees Fahrenheits, which we're not used to.
First, she put her smile away, the one who kept showing off as a defense against her friendly surroundings.
That made her very relieved because that was a mask she decided not to put away in public.
He was honest at home only in the days when she was a grandmother, and she had the grandkids of Elinka or Adika around her.
And, of course, when her sons were on the phone.
She remembered very well the lesson from endless business skills courses.
Now they're really good at it.
So she won't grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a costume on a masquerade.
November, or another month, she can't do that miracle to make her smile really, like when they were on a trip with the one that hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt presents to the office of the first elected President
Muhammad Mursi took an inaugural oath, but his triumphary day is only hard to end political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Morsi promised "new Egypt" when he was solemnly admitted to office as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husní Mubarak, who was deposed 16 months earlier.
In his introduction into office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian Head of State since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges cast into black Tallars in a mansion built with views of the Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for better tomorrows, new Egypt and the other Republic,” said Morsi during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today set the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which has been, for most of 84 years since its formation, an illegal organization of sharp attacks by individual governments.
When Mursi arrived in a small car column shortly after 11 o'clock, hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the court to celebrate the President, and unlike Mubarak's presidential splendor, the transport was only a short stop, so that the column could usually pass through a busy road linking the city center with the suburbs in the south.
Morsi's personal prestige, derisively referred to as the "reserving tyre" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown rapidly since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists, but also as well as to those who wish to lead to the end of the rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Morsi, who was dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie to the judges in a wood-clad chamber, where he took an oath.
Mursí later traveled to Cairo University, where he was to present his inaugural speech.
While he was on the lookout, he received an official welcome from a military band that played a national anthem.
He was a military commander of the Field Marshal Hussein Tantava.
His arrival was accompanied by a scandal "armad and the people are one hand" from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the university's main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s it became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, a place where the revolution was born, which ended last year by the authoritarian government of Mubarak, and solemnly promised that he would once again take up the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council which took them from the disfellowshipped leader.
But by agreeing to the formation of an official oath before the court, rather than before Parliament, as it is customary, he submits to the will of the army, which suggests that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech on Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.
There'll probably be police specialists in the ghettos to ease the tension.
Police specialists should operate in the Czech Republic in the future.
They would spend up to half of their errands here.
They'd look after order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from the poor and the people around them.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Interior is counting on it.
According to him, the improvement in the situation in the country would mainly help to "absorbed social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were 300 poor houses and quarters in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, especially the Roma.
Adults in ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
She's a whiff of us.
According to the experts of problem localities, 100 has arrived in the meantime.
Relations between their inhabitants and others are getting worse.
There were anti-Roma marches in several places.
The extremists were joined by people from around here.
According to the interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in ghetto areas.
It is said that "consistent application of a level playing field in law enforcement" is essential.
But it is said that without detailed knowledge of the place and people it is not possible to achieve this.
A specialist would take errands at the ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, the rest of his life serving in his territory.
In the problem locality, he'd be overseeing order.
He would also know the locals, so he could solve problems or misdemeanors better.
"Thanks to their trust, specialists will be able to prevent a number of infringements more easily," said the inside.
Specialists in ghettos would get extras, 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas should be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about EUR 600,000 (now approximately CZK 15,5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the total, 85 percent of the funds.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being processed.
The project is due to continue until 2016.
The authors inspired themselves with their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements here," reports the authors.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis of the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money these members will be able to release to the police every year after the project ends.
According to the draft project, first selected police officers attend an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should undergo this training each year.
The best candidates will come from them.
Special training should also be created for police officers who will operate in ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
They say it should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the idea, the interior should have three categories.
Minimum standards would be met by hostels with exactly defined rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The medium standard would be in smaller apartments.
Higher standard should be social flats that are comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to carry out an integration plan to build up social workers with them.
They would have to comply with the rules of accommodation, care for their health, send children to schools, retraining and actively seek work.
If they tried to integrate, they would move on to a higher standard of housing.
The transition housing system should work for at least 30 years, according to the interior, until the next generation "in an integratedly motivated environment" is developed.
The model of social housing is prepared by local departments for local development and work.
They have to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Carbon hill - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The carbon hill is a noticeable hill 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Along with several others, it is recently a evidence of volcanic activity in Low Jeseník (in geological terms).
The last eruptions were here at the start of the quarter.
In view of the greater distance, the Baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary, built between 1755 and 1765, is noticeable on the top of the Uhlířské Hill.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The guest standing next to the church didn't behave.
Shortly after the church was completed, an alley was planted from four rows of Lip, a length of about 1 km.
The cross trip to the Carbon Hill is the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second one, from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
At 15 stops there are wooden plastics made by local art carving artist František Dommel.
He used various kinds of wood from the Low Jessenky area.
Similarly, the bases of the rocks from the local area form an interesting geological exhibition.
A sponsor's name is mentioned at each stop.
Carbon Hill is the rest of a young volcano.
Although data from radiometric measurements differ somewhat, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Rudný (older than 3.3 million years old) and older than Venus volcano (older than 0.8 million years old).
Sopka was born by explosion.
In the process, it casts out a large amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of the rocks from the ground which, by burning, gained red brown color.
At the end of this phase, it leaked to the surface of the lava - today it is a layer of porous jaw up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption cast red, brown red, and places up to black tuffs.
Their layer is up to 50 meters high and its part is accessible in the quartz wall.
In the tufes there are noticeable volcanic pumps of up to 1 m. Even the second eruption was completed by a outburst of lava.
At the end of the volcano activity, the lava leaked, which now forms up to 50 m thick layer of slag brow.
Volcanoes, which are rotated by the excavation of volcanic ash with lava discharges, are the most common types of volcanoes.
Because they're actually made up of layers, they got the name of stratovolcana.
The original volcano cone was subject gradually to erosion.
However, he was threatened by mining rocks in a quarry on the south side.
The most intense mining was carried out here between 1953 and 1962.
Tufas were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The mining managed to stop this unique place under the pressure of both the experts and the public.
The problem, however, is the porosity and small cohesion of the rocks, which are rapidly blowing, fall apart and slide down the slope.
Lom's gone pretty fast.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-oriented slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The repair is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
On the Uhlířský Hill you can reach the green tourist sign from Bruntál, or from Silesian Kočov.
Automobiles can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the Lip alley where a short educational trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a building with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts in Ořechovce.
Of course, the original owners of the house got it back in the restitution and the tenants had to move out with a little distance.
Ivana therefore quickly sought a replacement for herself and her older mother at that time.
She received a tip for apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"It was a shock at first, but a view from the fourth floor of an extensive forest park and the dam set me on the other side," recalls Ivan's first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a commission for, like, three years.
"Today, we've been living here for over 13 years, and I wouldn't change the owner for a gradual reconstruction," says the owner.
The mother and daughter moved from a 100 - foot - long apartment to a smaller apartment with a area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but the necessary adjustments, such as the paint of the door or the replacement of the windows, had to be made.
The previous owner crashed the core, but the owner was most concerned with the impractically handled and needlessly large hall, and on the contrary a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used the individual zones and the breakdown of the plasterboard room, which allowed for the new location of the lights.
The first intervention that she decided to do after a few years was to remove the bar in the living room.
This changed the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step towards partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor for laminate.
She didn't know how to handle Ivan's bathroom.
For years I've been picking up magazines about living and looking for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
So I addressed the young architect Kamila Doudírová on the recommendation.
"In fact, it was the most important step in the future," says Ivana.
Thanks to the remodeling of the bathroom it was possible to modify even the halls.
The architect connected the room to the toilet and bathroom and two doors with open wings replaced with one slides, saving the space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently barrier-free.
High quality tiles are imitationd by sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, a bidet shower at the toilet.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Douděr continued.
As part of the program The dream was built there was a quick but fundamental change of living room, which was also attended by architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping into the space, which was created by connecting two smaller rooms, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical separation, such as semi-precious or Japanese walls.
"That would violate openness and unity of space," explains the architect.
Originally, it was possible to separate the sleeping and living area.
It was enough to turn two sofas back on each other and put a custom-made dresser box between them.
The dining areas define the shades of floors and paints.
The architect used a high-quality marble on the floor of the kitchen and dining area, the sliding door revived the wallpaper with a pattern.
The corner, if necessary, covers sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor made of anti-allergic marmolea has a number of advantages compared to the previous one from the laminate: softer non-slip surface without the clutch and better sound insulation.
The system of arches and ceilings from a plasterboard highlighted in color is an example of how you can work in the panel with space.
I left the colors on the architects, I wished it were happy.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The plaster of the graffiti with the motif of the flowered magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
The architects selected a white tones to the warm energy tone, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment it was possible to store books, among other things, into space under window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably operated at a distance.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast of the new one works perfectly with the older ones, for example with the decades old crystal mirror and with the quality artistic objects Ivana collects throughout her life.
The last kitchen came in.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides and the owner felt a little bit like in the tunnel.
The architect took their number and postponed the deployment.
The furniture in simple design is custom-made, the white area softens the slightly pearly surface.
The washing machine, the dryer and the dishwasher fit into a small space.
In view of the small kitchen, it revived the whole glass lining of the walls above the workboard.
Unique graffiti with digital printed motif is attractive, and it is also excellently maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers that remind her of her favorite neighborhood in which she lived.
Now she seems happy here too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and washbasin, the new owner chose neutral shade of the frame.
Big shower has a glass door, Ronald.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the environment in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
We united the interior materially and colourly and tried its elegant, cozy, not too crowded look.
"Another condition of the award was a barrier-free solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the achievability of objects of daily need," says Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court has decided: Untime can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has decided that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can also be prosecuted for any criminal acts he may have committed before the Chamber of Deployment of Deputies in August.
It was only protected by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS Members Ivan Fuxi, Mark Šnajdra and Petr Tluchora, on the contrary, decided that they could not be punished for possible offences until they gave up their term of office in November, said the spokesperson of the Supreme Court, Petr Knötig.
The Court of First Instance rejected Iva Ištvan's motion to proceed in criminal proceedings with Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state firms for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in the approval of laws.
On the contrary, the former Prime Minister who offered them these posts can also be prosecuted.
They also arrested an anti-corruption officer with Wie Bart.
Bart's defense attorney, Oldřich Chudoba, who represented him in the case of alleged corruption by Members of the VV, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but he said: "Yes, I represent the client and on this matter, but, given the protection of classified facts, I cannot comment on it any further."
According to information, the General Security Councils (GIBS) are handling the case.
The server tn.cz stated that Barta could have bought classified information from the police.
According to the server first order.cz, the case could have been related to the case of former police president Peter Lessy, whose appointment he sought as Bart.
The last information, however, shows that the detention of Víta Barta is unrelated to Peter Lessy.
The spokesperson of the police Presidium Eva Kropáčová refused to comment on the case of the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson of the City State Office in Prague on Friday.
That is where the plaintiff oversees Bart's case, and its words indirectly show that the file or criminal proceedings are carried out in a covert procedure.
Reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vít Barta Kateřina Klasnová in the morning before their residence in Prague in Klarov.
She was just loading bags in the car and leaving.
She refused to express herself to the whole event.
On Friday morning, Bártov's arrest was expressed by the leader of the Dawn of Tomio Okamura.
According to his words, he has no idea what's going on in the case.
"Welcome to Bart was one of many candidates on our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Barta, who has failed to run for the Twilight of Direct Democracy by Tomia Okamura in the past early elections to the House in Plzeň Region, is known for his corruption against the bribery of Members of Public Things.
In April 2012, he was illegitimately sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Then the sentence was changed, and Bart was exonerated by the prosecution.
I want a contract at the NHL.
Juice, lust and enthusiasm I still have
For Prospała, family was always the first place, which is why she wants to be fully subordinated to it in her 38 years.
Either he gets a job overseas, and he's gonna extend his career, or he's gonna end hockey.
"I want to play daddy and husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who's still looking forward to the offer.
Despite the fact that he's a well-appointed workman who'll never fool anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on ice and can tear down his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player in the last season of Columbus.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," he says determinedly.
Maybe he will, and apparently New York Rangers stands for him, who failed to enter the season and have two wounded resistances - Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan's attackers.
How does it look when you come to the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on my paper, it's no good to deal with.
I know an article came out in New York Post that they should sign me, but that's it.
There was no more evidence that this really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
You haven't heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place daily.
That's where it's about getting into a situation where the treaty really comes in.
When a player gets hurt, or it doesn't work, and a manchaft doesn't work.
There's a lot of different factors that need to come together to get that contract.
But in New York, that's exactly what happens, isn't it?
The wounded is Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan, and the team didn't go to the season, so there's a chance there is, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The second thing is that you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality I have to live in.
Friday, you're leaving for America, and you're expecting something to happen?
I have the expectations since July 5, when the NHL opened up the free player market, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
No, I'm going to Tampa to see my kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun, and I'll see you again.
Do you have your program planned?
It's given that I'm a father and a husband, and that's what's going on.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play daddy and husband, and I'm looking forward to it.
On Sunday, yours has two hockey matches, it's a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking of doing this in full-time quotation notes?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
This could happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games for my knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it very much.
One day it gets to such a stage that all goals, victories and passes won't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could've happened to me besides my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play the NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, it's also a sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, I'm sorry, our children - mine and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we would love to see them continue in this trend.
Because what we're going to talk about, there are options in America somewhere else.
That's the chance we should offer them.
So you're planning on staying in America permanently?
We're going to practice it like we're going to.
This means that in summer we will be in Bohemia on Hluboká and in the surroundings of České Budějovice.
And in winter again in Tampa or where our steps will lead us.
It's perfect to keep warm.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say that I went across from him, it cost me a lot of strength and retribution, and it took away a lot of things I missed.
But hockey in return offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That we can choose where to live with a woman.
There are a lot of people in the world who want this to be so they can choose what they're gonna do and how they're gonna live.
How long will you be willing to work, train, and wait for your offer at your age?
Yeah, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how much longer it'll stay there.
I can't plan that.
So you could say you're gonna wait for this season to work out and then decide what to do next?
I'm at the stage of the day.
In recent years, CEZ Director-General announced that the decision to build 3rd and 4th block of the Temelín power plant was postponed by the end of 2014 or 2015.
It was justified by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and by agreeing to the Contracts of Difference by the Government.
These reasons enable CEZ’s current management to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. to the majority shareholder.
However, the qualified manager should give the shareholders a recommendation, not hide behind it.
The government alone with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš begins to accept that his movement ANO will not have time to learn a political craft in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government in order to create anything at all.
President YES admitted it in an interview for the Law, which will come out tomorrow.

CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The goal was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft bombed the military base near the Syrian port of Latakía on Thursday.
With the appeal to the unnamed U.S. government, the CNN broadcasted it.
The Israeli press has widely informed about the explosion in the alleged rocket warehouse, but the Israeli government has not confirmed it.
The spokesperson of the Israeli army, on CNN's question, refused to comment on the raid.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
According to the U.S. government source of missiles and related equipment, which, in the view of the Israelis, could be transported to the militant Hezbollah movement in Lebanon.
A.P.'s appeal to another U.S. security officer reported that the target of the Israeli air strike on the Syrian territory was the Russian missile SA-125.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the area of attack, however, according to the DPA, showed a battery of Russian missiles of type S-125 Nev.
In addition, they were told to have seen battery of SA-3 missiles, including a command centre with radar to track missiles and their targets.
According to the report, the missiles recorded are 35 kilometers [35 km] [35 kg] [70 kg] [70 kg] [35 kg] [35 kg] [50 kg] [70 kg [70 kg] [50 kg] [70 kg]]] [clause] [clause]]]]]]] [clause [clause]].
This year, Israel bombed at least twice the supplies of missiles inside Syria, reported CNN and AP.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly declared that it will intervene in any shipment of weapons intended for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to successfully resist this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic pre-tax profit to be between 325 and 340 million USD compared to 305 to 315 million USD from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12- to 17% increase in the record profit of USD 290.4 million from 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created an eight percent profit in the first half of the year, and the second half began with rapid growth mainly in Australian and British travel outside of business.
"At this date, our 10 profitable countries are profitable and several are heading towards record annual profit before interest and taxation," he said.
This is where Australia and Great Britain belong, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
During the second half of the year in Australia, recreational activities have increased, which compensates for a slightly weaker domestic market for business travel.
Similarly, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area in the UK, while business clients spent less.
America’s business recovered after a loss during the season’s weaker half-years, and is expected to yield a third full-year profit for the third time.
Flight Centre's shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at USD 38.20.
Greenpeace activists arrested in Russia transported to St Petersburg
Environmental activists who have been detained since September in Russia for protest against planned oil production in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St Petersburg.
Today, AFP has been informed of this by reference to the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.
At the same time, she claims that the original charges of her pirate activists have not yet been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women arrested in Russia after a non-violent action against the oil platform in the Arctic were transferred from the correctional facility in Murmansk to the Saint Petersburg prison," she announced in her statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are unclear; according to DPA, this was a planned transfer.
The environmental authorities first accused them of piracy, for which 15 years of prison was at risk in the event of conviction.
Last week, however, they announced that this charge would replace it with a milder riot, for which a lower sentence with the upper limit of seven years is at risk.
Greenpeace, however, pointed out in today's statement that the Authority's charges of piracy have not yet withdrawn as they promised.
That means that detention is now being charged with two crimes.
A powerful committee of investigation last week announced that the piracy charge would replace the charge with a rioting charge.
But when the 30 prisoners were brought before the committee this week, the charges of piracy were not dropped.
Instead, new charges were brought against everyone," she quoted the AFP from the Greenpeace statement.
The Russians arrested three tens of Greenpeace movement members from 18 countries on the Gazprom oil platform in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship that sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, everyone has been held in custody, against which they've filed appeals, but the court has rejected them all.
Green people complain about prison conditions.
Executive Director Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to AFP, said today that moving to St Petersburg will facilitate meetings with families and consular workers.
However, there is no guarantee that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they may be worse," he warned.
One of Faiza Oulahsen's detained activists asked for help from King Willem-Alexandra.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called upon him to discuss their situation during the scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It states that Maliki has a large share in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of the fights in neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
During English literature classes, at least one Shakespeare's game, the 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and the current British fiction will have to be studied.
The test will also include a "covered text" to encourage deeper reading;
The combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a language exam and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue new education tomorrow for English and mathematics – the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
For other essential subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office of Ofqual, which oversees the exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with the new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is "a broad consensus in terms of whether we need to reform our testing system in order to regain the confidence of society," and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation test be "more demanding, ambitious and stricter".
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison of schools in Australia, mathematics spends on average 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138 hours a year.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have stated that a comprehensive mathematics exam – together with greater emphasis on this subject in the results rankings – will probably encourage schools to provide additional education.
The teaching plan will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, a long-tilling dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava ČSSD was set.
It all culminated when Mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, turned to trial for the undemocratic drafting of candidates.
However, the case activists did not want to comment too much on this so that the party would not harm more before the elections.
But now the votes are numbered.
The head of the Ostrava ČSSD, on Monday night, called on Mayor Ostrava to step out of the party, and apparently pressures him to lose his function.
But Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What's going on and who's on whose side is described in an exclusive interview for the dailyist.
How do you feel about the election outcome?
The ČSSD certainly counted with a much better result.
She was damaged by the fact that before the election, there were issues within the media?
I imagine that social democracy could have a better electoral outcome.
But on the other hand, it matches the state in which the ČSSD is now in.
It's a party that has internal problems, is internally ill, and people feel it's not all right in it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the ČSSD?
In my opinion, the ODS has been going through bankruptcy for some time now, and unfortunately, things like this are happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their prebends at ODS, have moved to and influenced the people in the ČSSD.
It is then related to the fact that police and computer collection go to the offices of Ostrava Magistrate.
This shows that the ČSSD is not only composed of people who would like the good of all others, but many think of their good.
ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between Haskovec and Sobotkovci.
It's been prepared for a long time, though.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a prediction of what is happening now in Prague.
Haškov’s wing gradually occupied positions so that after the elections it could cause a situation that would weaken Sobotka’s wing.
One is in politics in a situation where sometimes compromises are required.
But everyone has an internal line where the compromises are no longer going, and that's my case.
I didn't want to run to the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaoralka that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotka's wing as Mayor of Ostrava.
The hasch wing gave it a stop.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michal Hask?
In my opinion, Sobotka is a person who always talks about the ČSSD programme and to some extent also about visions for the party and for this country.
I'll admit, on the other hand, I didn't hear anything like it.
Michal Hasek is fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to refer to the President of the Party.
This is a struggle for power no matter what and against the party's statutes.
In my opinion, Michal Hasek now put an end to his political career in Prague.
How did you feel about the ČSSD Ostrava leadership didn't approve of you for a candidate?
The political parties are based on a competition which will place itself among their members.
The competition should be largely based on programming visions and on the ability of these people to fill these visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have the capacity or visions in this competition, but the political side is for them an elevator to the money they would not have received elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start to get to the fore because they are unrepentantly breaking the rules, they are violating the laws of the party.
They make political parties to the mafia with their practices, and in my opinion they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
It is more important for me to draw attention to this problem than to consider whether Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties start to respect the Statutes.
Is that why you put a motion before the elections for a preliminary measure against the form of a candidate for the ČSSD in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of ČSSD in Ostrava strengthens its power by allowing organizations that do not comply with it to cancel, setting up a new organisation on purpose, gradually throwing out uncomfortable members of the party.
An example of this is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarik from the Club of Representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and then they canceled the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that it is the last possibility to enforce the laws of the party through the courts, but at the time when the other methods and controls within the ČSSD have ceased to work, it is the only option.
The effort to lead the Ostrava ČSSD led by MP Adam Rykala is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is a public secret that Mayor Lumír Palyza has the attention to this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then they strengthen their power on the side.
When I came back to the past, everything that happened around Banník Ostrava football club and buying Basel Stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could call me a man who puts money where it doesn't belong.
But the city bought property that has strategically great value for it.
How, then, do you see it further with your keeping as mayor?
The District Committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the ČSSD.
But I think it's just like when the thief screams, "Get the thief!"
When we look at the results of my work in the last eleven years, I see no one in Ostrava's social democracy, who would initiate and enforce, sometimes against the members of the party, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of a scientific and technological park.
Yet everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it any different than preventing others from sneaking into the places they want.
Are you going to fight these efforts any further?
Because if this Republic is to work well, political parties must work well.
It's hard for me to believe that any party will be able to manage the state effectively when he can't even drive himself.
So I'm not thinking about leaving the ČSSD right now, because I think whoever's causing cancer on this side is not me, but these people who are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc opens a public rink in the historical centre
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Sárý stated that the preparatory work on the ice rink was launched on 26 October and the aggregate for ice production is in operation from the center.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and the surface will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The pool has an area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
Both Brusselsers and passers will also have two punch stand.
"We expanded the floor area, enlarged space in front of the stand and almost the whole area of the podia is covered so that the skaters can easily move," he described.
Olomouc Streets are already resembling Christmas.
Last year, a rink was installed right in front of the main entrance of the city hall on Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could have taken off right in front of the City Hall in 2009, when the rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the Christmas market in the city.
The Christmas Markets, which are part of the rich cultural programme, will be launched on the Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlín will be resolved by a regional court
The Regional Court dismissed the charges of the 25-year-old Slovak and twenty-five-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men have denied the guilt.
They're facing 15 to 20 years in prison or an exceptional punishment.
spokesperson Petr Angyaloshy confirmed that the Supreme Court had repealed the regional decision and that the matter had returned again to the hearing.
The reasons brought about by the judge refused to comment on the fact that the decision has not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the prosecution, young men attacked a seventy-seven-year-old man in his home.
Senior died of a agony death.
According to the prosecution, the men strangled him, beat him, kicked him all over the body, as well as the metal object, probably with a gas gun, tossed about three dozen wounds in the head.
A man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures of the cranial bone, swelling of the brain, or bleeding into the brain that he was attached to at the site.
The youngsters reportedly took about 3000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14 thousand crowns from the house.
According to the Regional Court, they were the only direct evidence against the defendant's scent marks, which the expert assessed as not entirely established in the meaning of the legal guidelines.
The smell marks from the crime scene and other things were in more than ten cases consistent with the defendants, but at first the police treated them as material and not scented traces.
In addition, there was some doubt in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the defendants were not found without doubt.
However, the Court recognised that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
Neither did a distressed rescue doctor notice.
After a few days, CSI contacted the omnistical physicians who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police couldn't work with all the traces of the crime scene the relatives cleaned up.
No DNA was found on the scene of the defendants.
Mladý Slovák lived in Uherskohradištěstsko.
He is now serving a penalty of 8.5 years, which was confirmed last year by a competent Olomouc Supreme Court.
A man, according to him, was the head of an organized group of six youths with a robbery of goldsmiths.
The robbers happened in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopné.
Younger than the accused of the murder of a senior lives in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him in August after 11 months.
Znojmo starts with the stadium reconstruction
In the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.

The reconstruction of the urban stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages in order to meet the standards for the first football league.
The living legend Wayne Shorter will close next week's Fall String
The saxophone greatness and the legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make next Wednesday the 18th edition of the String Festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6th at the Lucerna Grand Hall together with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Pattucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, the spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia will be added to Shorter.
In Shorter modifications for the symphonic orchestra the song Pegasus from the novel album Without A Net, as well as its older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, which also shows that the Prague concert on the Sterns of Autumn will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music over 60 years ago.
The number of performers he worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitoush and Vienna's native Joe Zawinil, with whom in legendary Weather Report for more than one decade they gave direction to a new style of fusion.
For the past 13 years, he has been performing especially with Wayne Shorter Quarter.
Some afterparty after the festival will still be Spotlight Club Night, which will take place on November 9th at the Roxy/NoD Club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triany, the local audience will introduce the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-driven electronics and the young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, which will bring an electro-jazzian formation of Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
The ladies say UEFA forbids publication of penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairman of the panel of arbitration of the Czech Football Association, has stopped publishing penalties for barrels.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, as stated in the interview for the journal Law.
Otherwise, the FAČR would be threatened by sanctions.
Damková also refused to take sides with the footballers of Pilsen, where they come from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in case of a vote, I can lose 1:6," said Damková in response to the criticisms that erupted after Plzeň's recently played twice as much penalty as the other league teams.
Therefore, although the FAČR has ceased to publish penalties for referees in recent months, Damková assures that they are suing for their mistakes.
"Trust me, if the committee finds out that the referee has made a mistake, it will limit the delegation, whatever the game was," said Damko.
The reason why penalties are not made public is according to the Women's ban from the European Football Union.
"EUFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and punishes and punishes severely."
"We're very suspicious of us, and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We published the restrictions, but I received two very strong warnings that if we don't stop it, severe sanctions will come," said Damko.
The other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
If the disclosure continues, the commission may lose money from UEFA on the education and development of referees.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we couldn't be able to complete the program on the referee's education," Damková added.
Bárty's arrest is related to Januška and Bém: Is there an escape of wiretaps?
The President of the public affairs of Víta Bart was arrested by the police on Thursday.
He was arrested with him and head of the Anti-Corruption Police Department of Analysts and Informatics Jan Petržílek.
The detention is linked to the listening of lobbyists Roman Janušek and former Mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the wiretaps, with which the server Novinky.cz came, confirmed the Czech press office a trusted source.
The phone calls heard by Janušek and Béma last March, published by the newspaper Young Front Today, in which both men address each other "Mazanka" and "Kolibřík", show Janošk's influence on the steps of the city under Bem's leadership.
The daily noted that in 2007 the Security Information Service (BIS), two years later, had escaped from the security agency ABL.
That's when Bart owned it.
Server News.cz pointed out that CSI Petržílek was working for BIS just before his entry into the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek moved to the anti-corruption department, which was subsequently investigated, at the time when they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm anything at all," said the plaintiff Michal Muravský of the Municipal State Office in Prague.
He refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case does not want to comment or inspection for the same reason.
Six companies out of ten are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six companies out of ten have been preparing intensively for the upcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act since 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the companies questioned stated that they did not deal with matters related to the two key codes in their company at all.
This comes from an investigation by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal law, which was researching the views of 108 Czech companies.
With regard to the upcoming date of the effectiveness of the two key codes, at the very moment, a number of managers are beginning to realize what can have a significant impact on the business of their companies.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our view, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
The business sector has long lived in uncertainty about the lavender of politicians, whether or not revolutionary changes will come to an end.
"Now, however, they only have a few weeks left to move to new law for their companies without complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of 61% of the companies dealing intensively with the new laws, 26 percent indicated that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be ready in time.
In addition, 35 percent of the companies in this number are going to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, every fifth company has not yet dealt with the recodifications, yet has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent do not have an opinion and cannot judge the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that the recodification issues have not yet been addressed.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the largest number of companies questioned to conclude new contracts (21 percent), followed by a solution to business conditions (16 percent) and changes in the real estate cadastro and liability (ten percent each).
One of the most important news of the entire recodification of the contracts will take place in the case of contracts, only under the new Civil Code.
The current parallel adjustment in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, resulting in a more transparent contract law for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adaptation will offer many innovations with an emphasis on greater freedom to arrange relationships," said lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddaný.
In the context of the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue to be the most important topic of increasing the responsibility of the statutory authorities.
The topics related to the changes in the convening and the general meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent) are also followed.
The new legislation means tightening up obligations and possible consequences for the statutory authorities, especially in situations where companies are at risk of bankruptcy or entry into bankruptcy.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the board of directors and the directors of companies do not deal with the care of the good owner and does not reverse the threatened collapse of the company, they may lose the benefits obtained for the performance of the function only in the last two years," added Spáčil.

Put through the mud, river and jungle and provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team will save almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not too many doctors in Western Africa; only one in 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates for the 2013 CNN Hero Award.
In the 2013 CNN Prize competition, you can vote for him or for any of the 10 main candidates.
The winner will get $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle has watched his father again and again go into unconsciousness and goes to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde.
First, he was only treated with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread to his brain, and there he created a haematoma that caused him problems his whole life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwell says.
You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., hurry to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients in there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died, the situation hasn't changed much since 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon per 5,000 inhabitants.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if Doctor Cameroon could visit, many would not be able to afford it.
Two of the five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the health care expenditure in this country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
They can't enjoy their lives because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his compatriots suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers did 700 free operations last year.
He became a vascular surgeon himself at a central hospital in Yaounde.
And founded a nonprofit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on the weekend where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, almost 32,000 people have helped their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people inflate themselves in supplies, attaches to the roofs of medical needs and travels through rough terrain to villages that need help.
They're not always accompanied by happiness.
Sometimes the vehicles must push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get welcome as real heroes: reception, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
In these villages, medical care is really a free reason to celebrate, and Bwelle, with his wide smile and unbridled energy, is very willing to join the local joy.
The next day, the team's starting to treat hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every expedition," says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many treat with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or gifted glasses or free birth certificate – a document that requires school, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
The team is doing simple operations under local anesthesia tonight.
The surgery is usually done in the school building, the town hall or home; after the surgery the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to release the room for the next patient.
Using the light from the generator, the operating room and the hygiene equipment of Bwelle and its volunteers work in the early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay awake and continue to work, they play drums all night," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired, but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of chamber doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
One man said that after the hernia surgery, he would be able to work again.
"It will change the future of our family," said a man.
In addition to organising these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works for private health clinics around Yaounde City at night.
He says that this second job is financed by about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she’s asleep,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He's always either in the hospital or he's trying to get money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For students of medicine and nursing services like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle's mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We washed hands and removed blood stains or held tools for Dr. Bwell," says O'Malley.
That's like a second year of medicine you'll never have in America.
Students usually pay their way to Cameroon alone and often come with donations of medical supplies.
But once they arrive at Yaounde, food, transportation and study provide them with Bwelle.
"Unquestionably he's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is infinite.
For Bwell, constant denial is not a burden.
To help others live happier, to fulfill their promise to their father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I'm doing this job," Bwell says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
Smile people, ease their pain – that's why I'm doing it.

Minister Holcát renewed the position of Chief Sister for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 000.
"I consider it essential that these functions are clearly defined and formalised so that the health nurses of their representative within the structure of the Office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary", explained Martin Holcat, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of a nurse, and I think that the nursing department deserves to be given proper attention from the Ministry.
In carrying out this profession, there is a need not only for a high professionalism, but also for a human approach and personal conviction.
"Rejoice and with full responsibility, I will try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent sisters in our health care, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who, with their approach to patients, do not help us to perform their calling with all empathy and help us to improve the image of our sister in the public's eyes," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Chief Sister Alena Šmídová, on the occasion of her introduction into office, also stated that she wanted to address various aspects of the health nurse's position and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medicines and doctors.
"I certainly don't want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to me, with everyone having their skills and, together with other health professionals, forming a team of staff who provides health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the work of a sister, I see these difficulties and I intend to contribute to solving them."
These include, for example, the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"From my own experience, I know that some of the sister's administrative actions are unnecessary and take time to give patients more time," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas to which it intends to focus include improving working conditions, finding ways for better mutual cooperation in the team and managing healthcare providers, adapting competences as well as employment issues such as compliance with the Labour Code or not overloading sisters their insufficient number at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous trails, which, however, are not documented for fear of a possible penalty, on a specific case where rules might be violated.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, so the position of the Chief Sister of the Czech Republic could serve in this case as a guarantee of maintaining anonymity of such complaint and of letting the relevant authorities examine the particular case," concluded Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Central Medical School in the field of Health Nurse (in 1978) and the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague in the study programme of Pedagogy (in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been the head of the Department of Health and Other Non-Surgical Areas and the recognition of qualifications for the Department of Education and Science.
During her professional career she worked as a nurse at the bed in the internal department, continued to act as a teacher at the Central Health School, where she was also an eight-year statutory assistant director.
From 2004 to 2009 she worked as the main sister of the prison service of the Czech Republic.
She published several specialist textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, devoted herself to lectures in the field of nursing.
She's not a member of any political party.
♪ So I don't cling to hatred ♪
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to write after twelve years.
After many years of reading, he lived, but did not write, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) published a new novel Wind, dark, present.
The number of parties comparable to that of the most famous version of the Houscan (Petrov, 2001) is not going to be a flexive volume.
For the Salon Kahuda confessed another prominent Czech writer today - Emil Hakl.
What happened after 12 years of silence, where did you write a novel?
I did it - so I wouldn't hold onto hatred.
To see around each other ever new and new clones of this human foolish littleness, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
We don't even talk about the elderly, the faces ruined by the helpless lust, the vexlanic soul and the opposite polo ideologists who try to sell their "product" with the expression of a little sales whore.
At the beginning of the millennia I bought a small digital camera and filmed my Judicrous friends, freaks and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from life on this planet.
I like to go for walks, and then I read books at the lamplight tonight.
You're talking about feeling wasted, hate.
Was there some kind of break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old, like all of us?
The break occurred a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, that's what I've been living for.
There's still a quiet boy in there somewhere.
I see other lonely trainers, everyone in their own tornado of anxiety.
It saved me from writing books.
I'm participating in this huge, thousands of years-long movement of the system of life on this planet - the spread of this incomprehensible future.
This huge, breathtaking complexity of life, when each stone is a direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when the path of experiment-omyl arises another generation of beings, which in billions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-speak, or better said, a dialogue that leads right and left half of the brain, sometimes sails to the surface and forms itself into a book.
Like the times of peace, intertwined by silently sleeping metastases of wars, which may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I could feel the mute avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I didn't do anything, I'd get hit quietly one day.
It is a set of questions that the brain has formulated and lays them down to layers that are stored in the darkness "under the level of consciousness".
Necortex, a gray brain cortex, asks the older evolutionary units, goes to ancient arks of the brain tree.
He talks to the furry beasts, asks snakes, searches for an answer in the flight of birds, lifts his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry heaven above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain keeps in its billions of connections and electrochemical ties all memories, experiences and experiences that the person concerned has experienced.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branching with trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to a constantly variable presence, in a relentless attempt to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes overload disorders occur.
Analogically - as if your PC fell from the program of a speech emulator and translator from foreign languages, you would first get caught in an operating environment, such as Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts ended in the dark green-bloating Biosu screen, in a basic system that manages functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about, I am talking about a psychospiritic crisis.
You mention her a lot - why do you care about this kind of regression regularly?
Because it's a pit.
In the meantime, the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - appears a breakthrough.
Here it is good to find Nietzsche: "So long he looked into the abyss when the abyss looked into him."
It draws the feeling that man is lost if all hope disappears, mentally "deaths" and new quality enters.
And why do I care personally?
I will answer the parable.
Once one fell into the dark and drowned, ran days, months and years, he was still drowning while reading, and those books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He became a diver.
Perhaps a written sentence will help someone, like the texts of Hrabal once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the particular person who will read your text?
One who can't say anything meaningful about it is called consciousness, another super ego, but I think it's what Arthur Rimbaud best described in a letter to a friend:
"I am someone else - this reader participates directly in the process of formulation of words and sentences."
From the early youth he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nem's submarine, running around the Shades in dark streets.
In the end, behind all the branches of the authors and their message, the sun of the bright worlds of the other Karl Hynek Mácha.
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
In retro-reflection, which will come to you through people who can read the book, will he get it?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who will take 300 crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in their difficult life choices.
Books are actually "life" or better said "worlds".
They are encoded into the characters of the letters, they have experience, the history of the regions of the language.
Whenever we can wake them to life, if we let their sentences flow into the brain.
In fact, in a way, something forbidden by divine - awakening other and other life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is stored in a line - according to old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After publishing the book you - as it happens - are waiting for a chain of readings.
I remember you used to like reading.
Are you going to be happy again, or are you feeling differently after years?
I'd rather tell you today.
And what did I find out?
Good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they're inconvenient, they don't look at each other, they're friendly, you don't feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived (and I hope that he still lives) one frivolous bookstore (named at random July), a merry friend and a good girl's bull.
At one time, he introduced me to the individual articles of readers of my book, the Houstina.
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown a bold, read copy of my book.
I was embarrassed to put off the recently split morning and cried briefly to the man.
We were all standing there, snooping and crying drunk with milk.
Then the young blonde bowl couldn't stand it, and he jumped out of the window to the snow.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran to the night country and fought with the happy rage of the sensitive, the painful souls of the compatriots and the steaks of the fallen patriots - went out and pampered as werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is also formally different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text of the Wind, the darkness, the presence?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel Suchodol, inserts the words of an old Russian myth in the mouth of a people's healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujanu.
It's a dog, it's a gray chest.
It's terrible, it's scary, it's a secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps we used to be devils in hell and draw - what role will we play in this country?
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to let that happen again in the free tide of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and nameless, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depths and in such a wide range that completely goes beyond our horizon - and so we do with absolute self-evidentness exactly in the intensities of our programmed task.
We are rewarded by the influx of dopamine, mixtures of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a disorder, and we'll show compassion.
Only then do we have a right to call ourselves human beings.
That's the answer to your question-- the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the ocean's coast of unconsciousness, and it's caught inflows of wet wind in a hollow sail made out of a dirty tissue.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama retreats from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama withdrew yesterday from his often repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health program, you can keep it".
With reference to hundreds of thousands of notices of statements from Republican providers, the President has been accused of cheating on the American public in recent days.
He knocked Obama off his original promise yesterday.
"The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called the “discretion in the media” of statements, Obama called upon the Americans who received these notifications to search for new insurance policies on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration claims that it should not be surprising that 5 percent of the population that bought the insurance for themselves may be forced to change the scheme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on Available Care.
"I say this to these Americans: you deserve better," Sebelius said in her statement to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Available Care Law, said that the launch of the Internet market went "poor" since October.
"I am disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
The irritable Sebelius said that sentence, which was caught by a microphone, yesterday, towards an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a Missouri representative, who was also involved in Obama's care program.
More than three hours during Sebelius' hearing, he repeatedly asked why the "architect" of the Available Care Act did not voluntarily give up the government of sponsored insurance and did not buy the program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you be calling next year?
Kellner, owner of PPF Group, wants to buy operator O2.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations, and according to various sources from agencies and from behind the scenes, the hand is already in hand.
The transaction notice should be received in November, probably before the start of the auction for LTE networks, which is before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns KKCG.
The one with the branded Sazka Telecommunications has been auctioned for LTE networks.
And to a general surprise, until then, there was no mention of the company's taste in telecommunications.
But now Sazku is leading a very experienced telecommunication mascara Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing boss of Radiomobile (now T-Mobile), then became the head of Sloven T-Mobile and he was the last to head the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The sazka plays a few cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she admits she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafona.
And it makes sense.
If the auction succeeds, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would probably not like Vodafon under normal circumstances, but according to the Hospodářské noviny information it may be part of much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from an agreement between competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender on the LTE network (as a newcomer can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there is not enough frequency for all).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
The Vodafone will release the Pouch into its 2G/3G network (respect of the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
In between, the bag will build a cost-effective LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The saved money could then spend Vodafone on some hard internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of the Czech) immediately acquired a full operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, he's a big moloch waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would already get Kellner behind O2 and very likely in synergies with T-Mobil.
Both companies have already declared that the networks will share.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not enough with the high amounts to which the state budget is looking forward.
Since next year customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafon, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárk.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Does the Czech Television ever pass without signing events?
It is not difficult to listen to complaints that gather evidence of the harassment of the castle type.
In the past, no one has documented the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Hardík, let alone sign it.
That's right, the editors stopped by.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where certain journalists’ acquiescence to the zemans is taken - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of unsolicited empathic favorability.
And once we assume general depravity, it is not possible to forgive the question of changing television conditions is whether others, no less unscrupulous power interests, which have not yet been given the opportunity.
The truth is that in developed countries, there are no attempts to intervene politicians.
The truth is, however, that does not mean that there are no complaints about public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they mainly criticise what they consider to be a tendency that is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and this situation isn't in our place.
But perhaps also in a country that thinks it's the most corrupt in the world, the black and white stories of evil politicians and good journalists spend more conveniently than the most complicated descriptions of an unsightly situation in which many imperfect human beings come to mind.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: Presidents on the edge of forces
It is almost a rule that in the key moments of the country, the head of the State was not in such a form as to fulfil its national obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to the end of his presidential period and events around Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after symbolic resistance, the Air Force could fly abroad, heavy weapons could have been destroyed, and the government could have fled to London right away and not fought there hard for their legitimacy.
And mainly from this surrender, the nation should not have hangover until today.
Benes was not a statesman, and he was still in shape in Munich, but in the war he began to go downhill with him and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
He could have gone into exile for the third time to break the legitimacy of the communists and their puddles.
It's a shame about Hah.
They chose him to say, "Mr. President won't be able to make a decision."
But he had to make a big decision with a knife on his neck at Hitler's chancellery.
Section of Intelligence František Moravec, in the last days in March 1939, said what should be done to ensure that the occupation, which he knew for the day, did not run so smoothly to the Germans and with such profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government didn't do anything, but they didn't trust him, and they were afraid.
The human wreck of Gottwald had his older comrades executed, as Moscow commanded him.
Ludvík Svoboda definitely prevented himself from participating in normalization and had to put him down, which was already quite illegitimate.
That Husak was powerless and sick depressive old man in November 89 made things easier, but that's the only thing.
Havel was lucky that he hadn't been met in office in the last few years, and he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his works make him suspect that the mental processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, here's what we've got.
Head of State and Head of Armed Forces looks like she looks, and we don't know it all yet.
Fortunately, now there is no risk of an external threat to the Republic.
Or maybe it's threatening, it's just not so obvious.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, it is not (in historical terms) good that the President is not entirely in strength.
But it's not normal.
Couldn't we have elected a president in this country once again with acceptable thinking and acceptable health?
Remote planets, black and white movies, or a little fantasizing about extraterrestrial life on earth are not themes that the American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would only throw up.
In the concept of his quartet, which on November 6th in the large hall of Prague ́s Lucerny will complete this year's String Festival, everything is related to everything.
A part of the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter quartet is the momentary feeling of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues have to play what they're experiencing right now.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber matter and think not of harmony or rhythm, but of film images.
This principle, however, is a fresh 80-year-old Shorter – an extraordinary composer, wearer of nine Grammy, former teammate Miles Davis, and today apparently the biggest jazz saxophonist – he doesn't like to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my 80 ’ s, I found it best to let life surprise me.
"To many people are planning everything, and then they are disappointed when things develop differently," says Shorter.
How the insects from Thailand raised the sales of the Paris bar
You may be snooping around with an insect and not knowing that you will eat it at least half a kilo a year.
Like ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trends: it is ecological, nutritious and you also have a unique experience taken care of.
The insect offer was included first in Paris on the menu at the beginning of October by Elie Daviron, chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, for which the name was inspired by the book William Burroughs Naked lunch, would be found in a fashionable 18th district near Montmartre generously visited tourists.
With fresh avocados, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, guests can enjoy not only different larvae, grasshoppers or water bugs, but also scorpions.
Carefully and specially packed deliveries (so as not to damage the wings, to distort the legs or to damage the eyes) send Daviron from Thailand.
Europe only learns to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of a pioneer menu in Paris provides several reasons to consume insects.
The first is an ecological benefit, because insect production is much less costly for our planet (as far as finance, space and water consumption is concerned) than for traditional meat.
"The insect is an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," said Daviron for Reuters Station.
At the same time, the young chef will not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes you enjoy, feel sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm merely providing a new experience," he explained.
Far from everyone would be excited about how they consume a bug decorated with a pest, but the response of the customers of the Paris bar to served insects is very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics say they'll finally taste it, even if they start with the smallest bites, and when they finally pick a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Union of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, Czech construction has been struggling with a continuous decrease in the volume of contracts and the state's interest to address the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the program The new green savings were a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
There is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the measures have been implemented, will save considerable amounts for heating, but also opportunities for construction companies and building materials producers.
Every billion invested will bring to the state more than 2700 newly created jobs.
From the point of view of state fiscal policy, leverage and multiplier effects are important, and they are also one of the most significant growth measures.
The union of contractors in construction in the Czech Republic therefore strongly disagrees with the government's resolution and asks for action to be taken to enable the programme to continue so that further calls can be announced within it.
Law, 1 November 2013
The dog summed up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up in crutches.
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on the bed, and left for the castle in Lány.
What kind of health is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage “went too far ”
John Kerry suggested that the US's defence attitude regarding its surveillance programmes should be improved, and in an unprecedented confession he said that, in some cases, espionage has gone too far.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as an "autopilot" in the light of the angry apparition of NSA's espionage activities that appeared thanks to an informant named Edward Snowden.
Public information has triggered diplomatic storms between the US government and its allies.
Through video-connection at the open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that have taken place because this possibility has been, with reference to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, September 11.”
So he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that America’s espionage crossed the border, but stressed that it had not been violated by anyone’s rights.
He said: “In some cases it has gone too far. ”
And the President is determined to try to explain this to people, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there is abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA's organization was seeking good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are struggling with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up. ”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is determined to kill and blow people up and attack governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented aircraft from falling, buildings have been blown up and people have not been executed because we can already learn about these plans forward.
On Thursday, the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said that American legislators are preparing for Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged US espionage and to convince Europeans that there is a need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he spoke to the members of the European Parliament and others and that he was concerned about their threats that he would stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations because they were disappointed by the follow-up of the National Security Agency (NSA).
It is indeed important for the US's national and security interests that Europe should remain with us on a single ship, taking into account joint efforts to combat terrorism, in an interview with Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the President of the Senate of Foreign Relations for European Affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA's programmes.
News in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe, disrupted relations with some American allies, even though the Head of the Agency said this week that they were imprecise and reflected the misunderstandings of metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
The following revelations were quoted by documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA followed Angela Merkel's mobile phone and other 34 world leaders.
The Director of the National Intelligence James Clapper espionage of allies has defended as necessary and has said that this is a common matter on both sides.
In the middle of the moaning Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary journey that should take place this year and hopes that the delegation will be attended by members of both sides and chambers.
In the coming days, the names of other legislators who intend to engage are to be published.
He said he was still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the goal of the trip was to help make things right, he added that "the well-meaning measures" would be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people as regards the espionage programs they have been using for years.
"While we are adapting our surveillance programmes to better protect European rights, they must also realize that we are not the only ones performing espionage here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is heading to the Middle East this weekend and to Poland to respond to the invincibility that has already caused the American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US tracking activities.
Australan has appealed against staying in Thai prison
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to a 15-day prison on Phuket Island, when she falsely claimed that she was attacked by a taxi driver, she appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused by an Earth Court on the Phuket island of perjury when the Thai police said that a taxi driver along with two other men who were holding her had attacked her in the morning on Sunday, June 10.
However, the industrial television footage later revealed that she returned to her hotel safely after she broke up with her Australian friend.
The Phuket police interviewed Bamford two days before she confessed to making up an incident.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low security facility in Phuket, instead of being put into adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who, in his daughter's case, asked for the help of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canbera.
Tunks told Sedney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about the fate of her daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
“This is obviously a difficult period, but we hope that he will return to us safely as soon as possible,” said Tunks.
Bamford appealed against the judgment and was released on bail of 50,000 Bahts.
In the meantime, Australia reports that she has spent her holiday in the Krabi Recreational Area in the south of Thailand.
Legal resources in Thailand claim that Bamford was representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and lead her to a prison for adults.
However, following the recent murder of the Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to correct the shattered image for tourists, which may have just been behind the liberating verdict.
Jagr joked: Goal from a brooch?
He won a puck in the defense zone, and no one else caught him.
Moreover, he turned the leak after a fast forhend button.
Jaromír Jagr scored against Tampa at night on Wednesday, on Thursday night then 119. winning goal in the NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petra Svoboda heard from the director of the Czech Railways and asked him if I would be interested in making a commercial for their most modern train Pendolino!" he wrote on the introduction with an exaggeration of Jagr.
They say we're a lot like each other.
I guess I'll have to quit my night training so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid that the Minister of Defense might then speak up and want to do an ad for the jet!" he added smiley faces.
In addition, New Jersey scored a second victory in a row.
"And above all, you have noticed - Mary Rottre's treatment works," Jagr concluded.
Post-electary candlehead
October elections rather than winners have brought a bunch of losers.
They are not only parties that have not even reached the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SCOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD due to its inner dissolution.
Instead of holiday candles, the politicians served us on a weekend of election goulash.
Andrei Babiš's election has become the jumper that promised the voters to change their political style of governance.
The fragmentation of the electoral outcome and dissolution in the winning party is recorded by the political (from) will of President Milos Zeman, irrespective of the wishes of the voters who publicly supported Zeman, nor have elected to the Chamber of Deputies.
Although the President lost a strategic lead in front of other politicians due to an unpleasant event, he still has a few ways to get it back - for example by choosing the future Prime Minister.
While the ČSSD has the chance to get a prime minister's chair in my eyes, businessmen Andrei Babiš are coming closer.
The election development is a long way from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the electoral scenario of the left-wing government of the ČSSD supported by the communists, this development is only a better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy.
Due to the loud resistance YES to join ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL coalition (total 111 Members).
Due to the conflict in ČSSD, which has become an indelible and weak foundation in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be quite daunting for the ČSSD.
The Minoristial Government of the ČSSD, composed of "non-Seconds" at Castle, is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government that will participate in the ČSSD will be threatened by the unsatisfactioned ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead to further dissolution on the side sooner or later.
So I ask myself, "Are we not going to fall to the next early elections?"
The next election would be a referendum on the power of the voter's mandate of the YES movement.
The ČSSD's plans to introduce sectoral taxes, to increase taxes on income or to build a state bank have hopefully fallen below the table.
On the contrary, the Parties to ČSSD, YES, KDU-ČSL and Ústít will agree, for example, to promote entrepreneurship, a moderate fiscal policy (a government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote the employment of disadvantaged people, to reduce the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
Third areas are most common in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
YES is now on top, so the program so far the most likely coalition YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would tend to lean to the right.
Which, in my point of view, is a better result than the left-wing tax program on anything that moves in the economy.
