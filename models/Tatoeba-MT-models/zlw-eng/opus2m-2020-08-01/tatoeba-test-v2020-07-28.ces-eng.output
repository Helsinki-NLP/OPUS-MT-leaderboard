What does TATOEBA mean?
Where were you all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before eating.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.

Tom left a tip on the high table.
There's nothing like a glass of beer after working all day.
She doesn't know any of us.
I'm satisfied with my work so far.
Do you really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to that meeting, even though I was invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you were probably dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for it.
Tom's clearly lying.
So straight and then right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why is there no food in the fridge?

Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer in our house.

I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are dying out fast today.
Tom's still busy.
You better go now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I'm sorry to interrupt, I just came by to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train must have stopped because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What did Tom scream at the crowd?
He's an ideal husband to me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a 17th-century costume party.
Are you happy with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?

I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom going to visit?
It's Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you take me out for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I cannot answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
It doesn't surprise me when it happens.

You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.

This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything bad about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own.
Once we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a laugh attack.
Tom's wrong, right?
Better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.

I borrowed that ridge.
I'm boring.
I'm writing my will.
