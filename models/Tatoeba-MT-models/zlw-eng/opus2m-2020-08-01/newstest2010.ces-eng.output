Barack Obama gets the fourth American President of the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will be arriving in the Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth American President in history.
Diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million will be awarded for, among other things, exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between the nations.
The White House's boss will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with Michelle's wife, and he'll be busy.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet five members of the committee who selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations for the first time in October.
The presidential couple then have a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will be concluded by the ceremony, to which Obama will take over prestigious awards.
He'll get it as the fourth American president, but only the third to win the prize directly at the office.
The White House has already seen Obama talking about Afghan War while taking over the awards.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that he is taking over the price as the president who is currently fighting in two countries.
War effort a few days ago has increased the second deployment of troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to stress any of its critics.
At Obama's ceremony he will also receive a gold medal, diploma and check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
You're going to give for charity, but you haven't decided for a particular charity yet.
The charged program will then lead the president with his wife to a banquet, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, the Prime Minister and other 250 invited guests will also be present.
Obama, from the beginning to the price, was more of a restraint.
For example, he stated that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not only a price for him, but for all those who seek the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that he was "a challenge to action".
A Protector of Nature Accused of Extortion
The Litoměřitic Police accused the President of the Civil Society of Nature Protectors Litoměřice of extortion.
In a few cases last year, he referred to some construction proceedings, for withdrawal of appeals he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said police spokesperson Alena Romová.
Lubomír Stud is the chairman of the Litoměřik Society of Nature Protectors.
He's in custody now, and he's been in prison for up to three years.
Controlling containers of Brno don't smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort the packaging from drinks, and in South Moravian villages you will meet the sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There, you can reserve a few minutes before you can find the right garbage cans.
I don't mean to say that there's nothing left of waste in Brno.
But it seems to me that the fact that we are the second largest city in the Republic, councillors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest league of sorting waste not only by throwing only paper, glass and plastics as citizens here, but above all by the number of bins on such waste.
Have you ever tried downtown, for example, to throw a PET bottle in a collection basket?
It's all finished, it's all about time and nerve.
The only place I've encountered so far is in the Moravian Square opposite Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I feel like a hell of a lot.
Not to mention, even in other parts there is no honey sorting.
A number of my friends don't like running garbage like that.
It's lazy.
They're a long way to the ashtrays.
I don't blame them.
I offered myself after the party to throw away a couple of glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colorful bins on Kounice Street.
Fortunately, I ran into the right place on the way to the shalina.
But the garbage was overflowing.
It's still the center of Brno, which the city most represents, isn't it?
But ecology and some aesthetics probably don't care much about Brno socialists.
They'd rather buy the city a hockey extraliga, which would embarrass us all over the country than buy some extra containers and offer sorting of other ingredients for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could confirm my suspicions after a while on the Internet with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst in the South Moravian region.
"Paroubk's" budget took money for pensions and sickness
After the left has added money to pensions, sickness, and construction savings to the government’s view.
But also interest on government debt or international lawsuits.
It will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists promoted an increase in some groups, they relied on the government to borrow additional loans for sensitive expenditures, pensions, or sickness. "It's just a delay in problems for the future, putting mines," says Janota.
In fact, the borrowed money pays more and more interest and has to return sometimes.
Not much choice where to take it, not a state.
If it does not reduce the social benefits or costs of running the State, it must raise taxes.
To everyone who has now added the left to the fire department, to the teachers, to the farmers.
And later on, their children.
Pensions or sicknesses, out of which 1.8 billions have disappeared, need not be feared, will receive them.
However, at the expense of becoming more indebted – next year it will not be missing only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and more quickly, along with him and the cost of interest.
The State will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternally, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Five billion will also be missing next year because of the cash transfers in favour of several electorate groups.
These are mainly already competitive and distributed sections that are not redesignable and, where appropriate, affordable.
It's not free, it's not free either.
This means that 30 large buildings are delayed or stopped, and European money is also being used at risk, warns the spokesperson of the Transport Ministry Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD has proposed that the loss of money will solve Solomonian – it reaches CEZ dividends, which the State owns most of them, and it will put the transport fund down.
The problem is that the dividends are never certain, and it's not a bottomless source at all.
Last year, CEZ entered the budget of 18 billion.
Every year, dividends are paid for environmental damage disposal, the pension account is added or used as a pension reform reserve.
Moreover, this trick, under EU rules, is increasing the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, this does not end the carnival of movements.
Almost three billion have remained in the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crime or for expenditure on judicial disputes, even for building savings.
If it goes around without this money, it's not certain.
That's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay anyway, says Janot.
The Minister will then have to save money within the Ministry or at worst touch the government budget reserve.
A hundred million is also missing from the already launched two billion-dollar State Treasury project, which is supposed to allow them to track what they spend on online.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance can't find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, the sanctions will come, warn Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
The Americans will count to the future with a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
Revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and you'll be transferred from Windows Mobile in seconds to Android.
This is exactly what the U.S. VMware aims at, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We'll allow you to run two user profiles at once on your phone.
You can switch between them, you can split them into homemade and work.
Both will work at one and the same moment, suggested Srivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented last November and was first presented a few days ago.
The market will be in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated a smartphone test sample to journalists with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran alongside each other.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware works with European and American operators to test virtualization of smartphones and customers should get their devices in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains troubles hoteliers
The old slopes don't only worry about the Krkonose lifters.
The missing snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Giant Mountains, rooms are still available for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a big visitor on our site.
People go through offers, find prices, but so far they're afraid to order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask whether we think they're going to be in the snow this year or in the mud," said the information portal operator Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants to stay in Špindler's Mill exactly as they imagine should no longer hesitate with the order.
Who prefers saving money and the quality of accommodation is in his second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
As far as New Year's Eve is concerned, Špindlerov hotelers offer more than a week's stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to turn them in for a while, but then they'll let go and go for a shorter time.
And then the rooms will be fast to rest," Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates still offers the Vrchlaba travel agency Ingtours.
Now we're most interested in a Christmas week that isn't sold out yet.
Even half the seats in our offer remain available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said Director Ingtoursu Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still offer a tourist agency, but the available places are less.
Well, the first 14 days in February go well, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
Nobody wants to spend the rest of the year in the mountains without snow.
If they are snowy during the week of the convention, Christmas will also be sold out," means Schiefert.
Rather than last year, the Horizont hotel rooms in Pec pod Sněžkou manage to accommodate.
We're about five percent better.
We have the last few places for New Year's Eve and New Year's Eve.
A great deal of interest is about Polish holidays in January and it is also well sold in February," Karel Rad informed the director of the best bakery hotel.
The hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janské Lazne has 80 percent of its stay.
On the contrary, half the beds are still available at the latest hotel in Japan.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, which we are already occupied by about 60 percent.
A little weaker is February so far, but once it comes to snow, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly rise, said the director of the hotel Omnia Erik Sporysch.
However, for the larger part of snow, Krkonoše hotelers must have a taste.
It's supposed to cool off on Thursday, if there's any rainfall, there should be snow on the mountains.
But then the warming is to come again, informed Jiří Jakubský of the castle work of the Czech hydrometheorological Institute.
USA: Repeating Is a Mother of Wisdom
It is very comical, with what kind of schoolwork Barack Obama, president of the smartest reputation, repeats his predecessor's strategy in the Afghan question, which he thought was the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly expected Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he described it through a copier from Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" in the text itself several times, but he did not even hesitate to use the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward".
However, he criticized Bush's idea three years ago to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq under the civil war as "incompetent and in his wake of catastrophic decisions".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy based on the recommendations of the field commanders was the only possible and successful enough to talk about Iraq today.
Bush did not improve the reputation, but objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that miracles are repeated.
He was asked again by the field commanders, especially the chief commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his sub-ordination practices, harshly criticized the valiant shooters in the White House.
He asked for 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't think of anything better, so at least he tricked the general by 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to expel another 5,000 from Europe, although he was originally counting on at least 10.
The most problematic of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to start downloading troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process within three years. Obama's entire doctrine raises more questions than it answers.
Many doubt that half the increase will give the same fruit as the process in Iraq.
Despite the murderous wars of recent years, Iraqi society has been relatively well organised, its leaders honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied on and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are getting used to changing their master every day, depending on how appropriate they are.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a potemkin village for which the Patriarchal Tribal Relations will continue.
The balance between the interests of the various ethnic groups is extremely complicated given the lack of transparency of the conditions that are even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the construction of an "accident state", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation, does not seem to be too real.
Obama's time horizon is invading its voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that the soldiers sent to the war sores for the purpose of "bringing home" will cause a miracle here, only the soul can truly romantic, untouched reality.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is a clear irresponsibleness, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect confession of the American defeat.
NATO's last summit showed that Europeans' willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is going to a minus.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of the Hindus.
Another factor capable of radically affecting the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the enhanced sanctions on Iran do not act, an excessive question will arise before the United States whether it does not attempt to solve the problem by military force.
She's gonna need to be answered at the exact time where Obama said America is going to go up for a victoryful withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left in the presidential elections, and that is, there is still enough time left to come up with another strategy if this is shown to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers no longer receive cash rewards
High executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs do not receive cash rewards this year.
It was announced by a company that so responds to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive, instead of money, a share that can be sold in five years' time.
Moreover, the shares can be taken away from managers if they risk excessively.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to combine rewards on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the wider direction it needs to go, said the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank became the target of criticism after putting almost $17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) aside for rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
In spite of today's announced measure, the total remuneration in the company for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion.
High rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in many countries with the arrival of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to charge 50 percent of taxes to bankers in excess of £25,000 (about CZK 712.000).
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
Today, five women in Stockholm took over Gustaf's Nobel Prize from the hands of Swedish King Carl XVI. This year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature.
In addition to four scientists there was also a German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for research in chromosomes.
Israeli Ada Jonath, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, received the chemistry prize for clarifying the structure and functions of the ribosomes.
The last laureate was the Nobel Prize for Economics won by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for an analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without the holder this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao took this prize for research in optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyl for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each award received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a financial reward certificate.
The amount for each category is 10 million Swedish crowns (about 25 million CZK).
If there is more in each of them, they share the reward.
Traditionally, the most expected Nobel Peace Prize was won by the American President Barack Obama in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he recognised the controversiality of his appreciation, for he is only at the beginning of his path and, moreover, is at the forefront of a country leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defending his policy, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to fight peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering the demise. Klaus invited him to Castle
President Václav Klaus will accept on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janot, who is considering the government’s continuation, because he does not agree with the state budget for the next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and perhaps even Janot's continuing in the cabinet will be the themes of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, he has too high a deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president's spokesperson Radim Ochvat informed about the meeting.
Janot wants to deal with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday about his next post.
Under the law on the budget, which Klaus will now get to sign, the Czech Republic should manage CZK 163 billion with the deficit.
On Wednesday, however, the House agreed to the Left's proposals for money transfer and increased the money to the salaries of state employees, to the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has made proposals for social democracy that they secretly increase the budget deficit.
There was a sharp interpolitic dispute between the left and the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, which led to a question about the further action of Fischer's official cabinet, on which the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party agreed in the spring.
The critics argue that the budget, as the House has adopted it, essentially eliminates the package of austerity measures that Fischer's government has put forward in autumn and which it believes is about to stop the debt of the State.
Klaus, which the State Budget Act can, but also does not have to sign, said for today's discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected "a serious problem", which is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
Today, according to him, he no longer has a good solution.
Only a strong government, which could, moreover, rely on a broader consensus of political parties, means the President.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is scary and the government should consider another existence.
Vice-President of ODS Petr Nečas told the Czech Republic that the concept of an official cabinet with support from ČSSD, ODS and greens is clearly no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer in response referred to similar words as "strengthening statements".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek on Topolánek responded by saying that the budget deficit that former Topolánka government has prepared for this year and will exceed CZK 200 billion.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD indicated the approval of the state budget for the next year for success.
People were also satisfied.
Mandel played Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's news
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie Invictus: Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggle and victories despite some criticisms that America’s actors play their main roles.
The story is about sport, racial conditions, and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless warrior against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and her first black president Nelson Mandel in his life story represents the Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that a 19-year-old Mandela asked him if he could make it in Eastwood.
Matt Damon plays another major part in it.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
For example, the 20 - year - old actor who won the Eastwood drama award from the boxing environment of Million Dollar Baby has already made a leader of the slave-resistance movement, which eventually became a slave, a fictitious president of the United States and even a god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active work on ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released for freedom in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is the Latin word for the undefeated and it is the title of the poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him
The picture is a true story of Nelson Mandela joining forces with Captain South Africa’s Rugby team Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains both racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can link his people through sports, so he decides to unite the ragby players who belong on a global scale among the outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman has been working for several years to get Mandel's story on the canvas.
I had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as close as possible to reality as possible, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, having dinner with him, being behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel's hand.
I found out that when I printed your hand, I took over your energy, it was transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, the captain of the National Rugby Team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of ragby.
A big surprise for him eventually was when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember the doorbell ringing, he opened it to me, and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in actors' characters compared to their actual models under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus was given: Undefeated positive reviews and ambitions for Oscar are also being discussed.
The movie critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summed up his ratings in words: "He was a very good story, very well made film."
In the movie reviews on the Rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secrets of the glowing of Norway are solved: the Russians tested the missile
Over Norway, a special light effect of unknown origin could be observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only yesterday admitted that near Norwegian borders tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
But the start was once again a failure and a missile called "Bulava", which was originally meant to be the pride of the Russian army, slowly became the black murmur of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimír Putin.
Even its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have an appropriate effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava usually didn't fly at all or was damaged in the air.
The Russian newspaper already refers to "Bulava" as "a rake that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but shines
This in order has already been the 13th attempt at first.
Until the end of the flight again there was a technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently, the engine blew up in the third degree of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" began from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donskiy, which sailed under the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows firing from a vessel that is in motion at the same time immersed.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unbelieving flying object was actually broken "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time and claim to be unequivocally impossible to speak of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident hit only three.
In previous cases, engines have broken right in the first step.
Although not even one test start took place without a mistake, only six out of thirteen are considered unsuccessful by the Ministry of Defence.
That's why almost 50 percent of the success rate is filled with optimism and still claims that "Bulava" will one day fly without any problems and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed the annual contract in CSKA Moscow in 51 years
Legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will again be present in a professional hockey game in 51 years.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and the Stanley Cup holder will assist in the need of their team CSKA Moscow and will appear to be in the KHL duel against St Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov, who ended his career in 40 years in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulyas was injured, we need another defenseman.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to help the team.
We just need to finish some formality, quote the agency AP coach of the Moscow club Sergei Němčinova.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only apply to one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of other players, said the German.
Fetisov thus becomes the oldest professional in Russia in the event of a return to the ice.
In the NHL, he played the season for Hartford as the legendary Gordie Howe and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven world champions, triumphed at Canada Cup and junior world championships.
In the second part of his career he collected successes even in the NHL, where in Detroit he doubled over Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hall of Glory hockey.
Hyundai satisfied the union, cancels all overtime
The management of the Hydei carrier car has agreed with the trade unions to cancel all overtime.
It was because of the often ordered overtime that the union declared a strike emergency on Monday.
It was confirmed by the spokesperson, Hydei Petr Vanek.
However, the board of directors wants to agree on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign on our production plan, it is essential, so it was proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, said Vanek.
Server Seven.cz wrote that the company of employees who work Saturday's shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
They'll get people back on Saturday November 28th.
According to Vanjak, the company decided to change the way employees were motivated for the proposed overtime.
They either get to pay overtime fees or they can choose a spare day on December 28th, thereby extending their Christmas holidays by the day, Vanek said.
In addition, all Saturday's staff will receive paid fares and lunches.
Since overtime was the most turbulent and hottest point in terms of comments and complaints by the trade unions, even the protesters, which effectively stopped production last week, the management decided to cancel all overtime for December with immediate effect yesterday afternoon, Vanek said.
By the last week, car workers were practically forced to work two more hours of overtime every eight hours after the eight-hour shift.
After the agreement has been signed, strike emergency departments will withdraw
Further negotiations between the management of the car and the trade union are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The union chief, Petr Kuchař, said on Wednesday that if they agreed to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they were ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The car situation went up last week on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously attacked because of continuous overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management objected that overtime must be done by the employees in order to meet the requirements for the supply of cars.
Experts also requested that no penalties should be imposed on workers who interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions demand that the overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay 5000 crowns for it this year.
It's now 2000 people who are employed by the head-car manufacturer, Hydei.
Serial production started last November.
By this September, it has produced approximately 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects the 'insufficiency' of HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the organism.
The main advantage of an improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity against medicines.
In some cases, this outweighs the fact that the compound on the normal variant of the virus does not act as strongly as some of the medicines already available.
AIDS has not yet been cured.
However, patients may significantly extend the life of a mixture of medicines that prevent the proliferation of HIV in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of the virus results in the development of so-called resistent viruses against which medicines are already ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called meta-carborates have an effect on the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metallocarborates are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists come up with new “better” compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of their molecular mechanism of binding to viral protein.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case a cobalt.
Deceptive and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of HIV that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV, the protease caused by HIV fission would not result in mature infectious viral particles.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, scientists explain in the press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medical Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically amended.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of HIV protease substances has been tested in the test tube and against its resistant (resistent) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalcarborates on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the clinically used drugs, but does not lose its effect for resistant alternatives to which medicines are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and also its other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical adaptations thus makes interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the laboratory of Structural biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The fight over the budget, the ODS went to Fischer, it's a fight to defend itself.
Head of ODS Mirek Topolánek referred to the approved budget for next year as "daunting" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider another existence.
The ODS’s statement called the Prime Minister a strong statement.
He's keeping time to analyze.
Vice-President of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is no longer working.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the House, which is to combat a growing deficit, or whether he is to remain in office with the help of a parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, noted Nečas.
The House adopted its 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with the left-wing amendments for more than CZK 12 billion.
The House increased the money to the salaries of civil servants, to the operation of social services and to direct payments to farmers.
The government’s claim to the social democracy proposals was that they secretly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the ODS room before the vote, so it satisfied the government's wish that the revised budget was less wrong than the budget commission.
Disappointment and vanity
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of vanity, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the current situation would still be evaluated by the government.
Inconsistencies are convinced that if Janota were to seriously threaten his departure from office in case of amendments, the situation might look different.
According to Czech Television, Janota ordered the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
He indicated that he considered further in his duties.
The reason for this is his disappointment from the budget negotiations.
If Fischer calls himself to continue the fight against the budget deficit, they do not, according to Nečas, have anything to do with the nominees of the ČSSD, which the changes in the budget have made.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will give a demise if the House approves other laws that increase deficits, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or to the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers of nominee ODS were not guilty
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated ODS did nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in the U.S. text message.
He recalled that there were people who voted against the budget for TOP 09 in several ministry positions.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of combating the high deficit of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he will lean on the left majority that is currently in the House".
He says he can't count on the support and tolerance of civil democrats.
I have not thought about it, and when this is being done, I will deal with it, said Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was nominated for the government by citizens' Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer left for the meeting of the European Council in Brussels this afternoon.
At the request of Prime Minister ODS, she resigned
At the same time, he stressed that ODS would probably vote against the revised budget on Wednesday in the House if the Prime Minister had not specifically asked for the adoption of the budget to be made possible.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, and he responded to the question of whether ODS was burdened by the absence of the President of the party in the Parliament and the Czech Republic in political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
When I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be the Bolsheviation of the House and the destruction of everything positive, he responded himself Topolánek.
According to the new order of ČD, less trains will be taken for almost the same fare
The Czech Railways will cancel or limit some less loaded speeds and localities as of 13 December, while other connections will, on the contrary, strengthen.
The total transport volume shall be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
More options for connecting to the capital will be obtained, for example, by the people of Ostrava, and one pendolino set will be added to this route.
On the contrary, the speed train will stop driving to Bratislava.
Less rapids will also take place on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the direct connection of Praha - Letohrad will be substantially limited.
The regions are planning the largest reduction of transport in the Králové Region, a total of 8 percent, while Prague and its surroundings can be enjoyed by an increase.
There are also two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and the operation of several fastlíků on the track Praha - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, and today Milovičtí must be transferred to Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the suburban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of electrification of the line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovice.
Remote connections to the capital will end at the destination station Praha Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperka/Jessenky will go at two-hour intervals.
From 13 December, passengers will no longer be taken to Bratislava.
This year's regional railway account: 200 million more
Fasts are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total to cover what is known as proven losses will give expensive CZK 4 billion next year, as will this year. The localities are ordering the regions, they will pay CZK 8 billion in total for them next year, with less than three billion of regions contributing to the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The roads have a newly concluded 10-year contract for locals and fasts, and the contract has always been for one year.
The system is praised by the railways, which is why it is not likely that the price increases have affected the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will take place only for one-day network tickets ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLišky will be new from the distance, so far it has been uniform for the journey between any regional cities and it has been 160 crowns.
The Philippines' armed forces are still holding over 50 people, the children are free
Today, armsmen in the south of the Philippines kidnapped 75 people, including several primary school pupils and their teachers.
It was reported by the AFP agency, which had originally informed only 65 of the abductions.
All 17 children in custody were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 gunmen say he's using hostages as a live shield to escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to agree to issue the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP Agency, the kidnappers were originally persecuted because of the violence that required the handling of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, a recent massacre, where 57 people were killed, was declared martial law.
There were 30 journalists among the victims of the massacre of 23 November associated with elections to the governorial office.
For suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippine province was arrested and his father Andal Ampatuan, the Patriarch of the influential family of the Ampatuan.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
But on Tuesday, they reinstated peace talks with the Philippine government.
JAR story applies to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (official name in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated) is coming to American cinemas, which captures part of the life story of former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa.
The role of a world-renowned fighter against apartheid was made by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose for his performance years ago.
The male side roles of the legendary South African champion in the rugby Francoise Pienaara were made by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the film, both critics and public are raised
Nelson Mandela
The full name of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in South Africa Mvez.
In 1988, Sakharov received the prize for his freedom of thought, and in 1993, together with the de Klerk Nobel Peace Prize.
The President of South Africa was from 1994 to 1999.
great expectations, for it comes to the public at a time when preparations for the world championship in football are peaking in the South African Republic, but at the same time the media shakes up worrying reports of increasing racial hatred and discrimination against the people by the black ruling majority.
According to the intelligence agency, the new film in JAR has been positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations regarding the main roles of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of his words for a new film.
I've been dreaming about that part for years and I've been getting ready for it.
I have also met Nelson Mandela in person many times, so that, as they say, I could use his energy, he spoke in an interview after the Los Angeles film premiere.
I think it's good if we can remind Mandel's personality and message with the film.
It's the story of the South African Republic, but it's about every man, he added.
In the national rugby team uniform
A book-based picture of British writer John Carlin with a freely translated name In the role of enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave birth to the nation portraits South African human rights advocates during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman, for years, has been trying to keep two racial and mutually defined groups of the population and, like in 1995, Nelson Mandela, also enters his acting role in the South African national rugby uniform on the field of the World Cup, which JAR won at that time.
For entering the lawn in a uniform, which is understood almost as something sacred in JAR, Mandela collected a large oat mostly of the white audience 14 years ago and gained recognition of the white population.
Football Championships may be able to reconnect people into one nation, said the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in JAR is improving, it will only show up.
The White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as a member of rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled to Britain in a recent interview for LN.
The championship will begin on 11 June 2010.
The transformer is burning in Louny for tens of millions of crowns
The fire captured the transformer of Čeps in the district of Vyskov in Lounsko in the morning.
At the fire, according to the spokesperson, Lukáš Marvan is six units of regional firemen.
Originally firemen wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later they re-evaluated their opinion and fire by fire a mixture of water, foam and special fires.
The reason was technical failure, internal transformer shortcut.
No one has been injured, the accident according to spokesperson of Pavela Mandát does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions crowns, it will be calculated precisely after the fire is over.
The destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new one according to Mandate.
In ten years, the activity of Čeps has not happened, the faults of this type are unique, completed.
According to the spokesperson of CEZ for northern Bohemia, Soni Holingerová Hendrychová was not interrupted, the functioning of households, authorities and companies did not affect the fire station.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as the exclusive transmission system operator, 400 kV and 220 kV electricity lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 lines with 67 transformers converting electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and a line length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will file a criminal complaint for the slander of three Czech-SSD captains
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will present today a criminal announcement for gossip on three socio-democratic hetmans.
On Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubic Region and the captain of the Olomouc Region of Martin Tesařík.
Jančura said it in 20 minutes.
The complaint is related to the company’s efforts to operate regional train services in certain regions.
All regions, however, finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three captains are attacking us and talking about our choice of roses, while we only brought an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the Czech Railways prices that were closed last week.
So we're left to defend ourselves.
It's for gossip against the Student Agency, said Jančura Radiožurnálu.
He also stated that he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the submission of a criminal complaint to be a further continuation of the media show by Mr Jančura, which serves as an unpaid advertising by his company and its own persons.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of myself and of my region, and I will also challenge the other captains.
I assume that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr Jančura, who, in the case of regional rail transport, is manipulating the public and using false and false arguments, said Hašek.
Jančura has announced last week that he is investing several million crowns in advertising, which will warn about the disadvantages of the regions.
The radiojournal said that the campaign will stop after Christmas and want to continue after New Year's.
He specified that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign started by Jančura after the region agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Railways and to order about 150 billion crowns did not write tends.
According to Jančura, similar proceedings are illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Jančur, according to him, was already threatened by a member of the ČSSD because of the crisis of train transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't let it go, we could lose our bus license.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know which gentleman he is, I will not say his name, said the Radiojurnal of Jančura today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
The pneumococcal vaccinations from January will break down the experience.
It's supposed to be the first for families free and optional at the same time.
But there are already voices saying that vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal vertices.
The medical institute already sets out the maximum rates for vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are also clearly in the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free vaccinations for August children
From January, children born on 2 August and later may be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal pneumococcals.
The condition is that they haven't received a single dose of vaccination yet.
Anyone who started vaccination last year or earlier has to pay for another revaccination.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, she volunteered to vaccinate her children against a quarter of families.
Parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose and more.
Four doses are required for vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will issue CZK 300 to CZK 450 per year for vaccination doses.
But it saves for the treatment that children without vaccination need.
So far, the state has given about 500 thousand a year for all the child vaccinations.
The vaccinated vaccination was introduced by a so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including inflammations of the brain blans and blood poisoning.
For pneumococcal infections in our country, 28 children under the age of 10 will die from an investigation in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, fenced vaccination of children against pneumonia was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, however, there are views that this vaccination could be compulsory in the future.
From January to January, it should be covered by insurance and optional.
The compulsory vaccination would be better, for example, the head of the civil association Naloud Rudolf Kalovský.
Its association has long been promoting pneumococcal vaccines.
Experts at the international conference that our associations took part were not entirely satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed to enforce at least this.
I think that's the way we have to get on right now, said Kalovský.
But the Health Department doesn't want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point we do not consider it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, says the doctor
Chairman of the Professional Society of Practical Children’s Doctors, Hana Cabrnoch, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it might be considered a reduction in the number of revaccinations "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand to the political decision that the vaccination was launched as voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect their infants to vaccinate against pneumonia from next year more than 80 percent of their parents.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also groundbreaking in health insurance companies, not state, as the first area of vaccination for children.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving them for further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy substances themselves.
However, this is related to the concerns of the practical children’s doctors regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to their original intention, vaccines should buy insurance companies and doctors would receive them as much as the state supplies them for other vaccines.
However, some Members were concerned that insurance companies might "get money out of health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance company to pay them back.
According to estimates, individual practical children’s doctors will invest 40,000 a month in the vaccine, which is a significant sum.
It's not going to be easy, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist 's been stealing from a museum'
The son of a renowned American fantasist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to rob paintings worth $20 million (12 million) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr Frazetta and the other man used to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains bagr region.
Mr Frazetta senior, age 81, became famous for the creation of the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, as reported by the Press Agency Associated Press.
AP quoted the nameless police officer who said that Mr Frazetta's younger could have been motivated to act by long-lasting family disputes.
Before the police, Mr Frazetta issued a younger sworn declaration, age 52, that he did so on the instructions of his father, "that he would get to the museum in such a way that he could and would move the images into the malting space," as the agency said.
Mr Frazetta senior denied the granting of any such permission as the Agency said.
Labourists are opposed to the planned increase in taxes
Ministers were defending the increase in taxes and spending, as announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, Tory's "poor" possibility to show that they are serious postponement of the decision to reduce the deficit until the time after the elections.
The chancellor got under fire because of the disability of low- and medium-income workers.
According to his proposal, it is mainly an increase of 0,5 % in social security and 1 % of the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Consistency with regard to social security
The unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not blame and warned in advance of "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of around 3 trillion pounds a year - which has upset the community of entrepreneurs who have said it is employment tax, while the focus should be on economic recovery.
This increase, limited to these revenues higher than £20000 per year, will affect around 10 million workers.
PBR KEY BODIES
Social insurance will be increased by another 0,5 % since April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected, by 4.75 % this year
New taxation 50% of bankers' bonuses
Increase of 1% company taxes for write-offs for small companies
Tax reductions for electric cars and wind power plants
Increase in pension measurement by 2,5 %
According to a government financial administration estimate, some revenues of £30000 will fall by £90 per year and some revenues of £40,000 will fall by £190, while some revenues of £10,000 will increase by £11.
Ministers announced that their deficit reduction target by halved by 2013 meant "compared decisions", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall on 5% of those with the highest income.
The finance minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and reductions in expenditure would be an "tip in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to cut the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said he was convinced that the economy would grow at the turn of the year.
But developing a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In his opinion, the decline in the economy was 4.75 % this year - much worse than the decline of 3,5 %, predicted in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Wasted opportunity'
Conservatives, who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warned about the "crisis of indebtedness" of the Labourists, indicated the planned loan of 789 trillion pounds in the next six years for insufferable.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan, as could be paid, to add, "cynically" this decision until the time after the elections - which must take place until June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," said the Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, as opposed to Tory's proposals, who would like to reduce deficits faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats claim that the money obtained by increasing taxes and cutting expenditure should be used to support expenditure next year and not to reduce deficits, and argue that the plans are "sand-based".
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson mentioned the timing of the communication - for example, the above inflation will increase and there will be inability to pay benefits in next April - that this could lead to the charge of the Chancellor in the election campaign if the money would be difficult to get back a year later.
But Labourists insist on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised on September, 2010.
Suspect budget'
Although the ministers did not publish the details of the expenditure after 2011, the economists stated that it is clear that the reduction of public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The recognised Institute of Budget Studies has reported that Chancellors' figures indicate significant cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really very painful so far," said Director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the election if we win them," said Roger Bootle, economic advisor to Deloitte's reviror's accounts.
"This was a report on a suspicious preliminary budget.
The FBI is investigating the US prisons in Pakistan.
The FBI is investigating five Americans in Pakistan, suspected of connecting to extremists.
Men were imprisoned for attacking a house in Sargoda in the province of East Panjab, as the BBC told the US Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI has reported that this is an investigation into whether these are the same men who have been declared missing in their home in Virginia's U.S. state last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are mentioned as originating in Pakistan, one of which has Egyptian ancestors and others came from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they were staying there," spokesperson Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit reported that agents were informed of the incarceration and were in contact with families of missing students.
"We work together with Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their actions here and whether they really are missing students," she said.
Pakistani embassy in Washgington reported that men were arrested in a house that belonged to uncles of one of them.
He said that the house was always at the heart of the interest of the local police and that the charges had not yet been brought against the men under arrest.
The Foreign Secretary Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, said Reuters press agency, but said that the United States must "co-operate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in spreading the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejection of amnesty for Iranian abusers.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, as stated in the Amnesty International report.
The report describes in detail "the ways of torture" in the regime before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened by rape.
Iran denied the criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran and dozens were killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejadad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Tens of them were placed in custody, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five people to death.
The BBC writer in Tehran John Leyne, who is now in London, stated that previously, in protests, the supreme leader Ayatolah Ali Chomejní declared the inadmissibility of certain methods of torture and prohibited their execution in Karizak's corrective facility.
But since then almost no criticisms of the rule of law have been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
A false confession.
Amnesty International quoted 26-year-old student's report on the computer technology of Ibrahim Methari, who reported that he was accused of "work with Facebook" and protests against election results.
"I was often punched in the face," he said in his statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, he said Amnesty.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was arrested after the protests after the elections and was tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian senior civil servants denied rape charges, but admitted that torture was involved.
Amnesty also reported a case of a former prisoner who said he was held in a container with other 75 persons for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognised that the Iranian Parliament and the Justice set up committees for the investigation of the government's electoral unrests and reactions, but stated that the mandate and powers of the institutions were unclear and that the findings of the parliamentary committees had been published.
The group said that at least 90 people have been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow has been used to turn the monument to Bristol into a downhill race.
The downhill track for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prices.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park's downhill downhill, a short jumper bridge was a long downhill road 100 metres ago.
The student of the fourth year of medicine John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the downhill track, but it was really depressing.
It was a wonderful view of the city's flashing lights downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talent," he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the slopes.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can he be a Muslim French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters called for a ban on the construction of miners and, in general, the alarm messages about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, the American academic wrote and informed and intended whether the Muslims could integrate - and whether they are integrating - into one of the most open secular societies of the continent.
After reading this book, some readers became admirers of the author's last work, "Why the French don't like scarfs on their heads" (2006), this elegant and debated study on contentious issues that they divide and employ the country for 15 years and whose impacts are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a wider and more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the core.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now care about 5 λ 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproduces debates between teachers and students about issues that are most concerned.
Should Muslim join the marriage union in the mosque or the city hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about gay development and rights?
Is Muslima able to marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslima have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
These seem to be the worldly contentious questions that are being discussed, and which are part of everyday life rather than political drama that employs the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other generally known persons, not including Tarik Ramadan, Arab, Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen at the modern secular society at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists who Mr Bowen has interviewed are referring to the belief that it is the counter-police of Selafi—the supporters of the purist Sunni Islam, gathered in Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but affects the European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adjustment requires compromises on both sides.
It raises the question of how far French politicians (and intellectual elites who defend the lay public) are truly devoted to the idea of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims are likely to have less experience on matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republics.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he discovered "touching of value screws".
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say, "Yes, but not now."
The Most Consolidious Perspectives in the World
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet's environment.
Bordering ice hides alarming speed, which affects animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural resources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In the book "On the Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the North icon, a polar bear.
Well known for its complicated history and methods of whaleism, it describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to capture a white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a courageous 14-year-old lifeguard who only fought a collaborating musket is a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming for their mothers just killed were caught and sent to the zoo and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed at the same time in one circus tent.
Even today, the zoos in the zoo are typically a million times smaller than the area that adults have at their disposal in the wilderness. Climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the holow hair of its cat.

Mr Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters are threatening the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where it is hunted from helicopters and Indians on skis, and they are all armed with powerful attack manuals to shoot off their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the biggest.
In his new book "After Ice" by Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, he offers a clear and uncomfortable responsibility for science for the Arctic and an enticing view of how the future can change it.
No, scientists have answers for everything.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have adequate response to the speed of change.
It's for a lack of tests.
Fridtjof Nansen's research routes at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century first indicated how the floating ice is moving.
The subs for the Cold War then charted the shifting divides when they sailed them.
Satellite research and extensive probe fields in floating refrigerators are a useful addition, but many are still taking place thanks to unhazarded individuals camping in winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the fallout system inside the Arctic ice, created by running saltwater, which is shrinking when it freezes.
But from the herd of that bear to the microscopic wonders, all of this is doomed as the summer ice moves, which will happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.

Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he never met.
For him and the other footmen who took the journey from camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington, to decorate the graves, that was the day they gave up tribute to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, said Robinson about fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me, to show me respect as I try.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to put wreaths at the cemetery veterans in several departments during the petition act in Arlington.
In 1992 Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during the petition act in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition when Mr. nMorilla and his wife Karen are making this trip every year and stopping in different cities along the way to honor the memory of soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcestesters do not seek profit, the wreaths across America, which they lay in other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 prisoners in the Arlington Cemetery, in the territory of the Pentagon, on the graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City, and at the monumental point of flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart Foundation has devoted over $150000 to the purchase and transport of dowries.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, stated that she had taken a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, the late member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way back to return what the victim was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
The volunteers walked through the cemetery through the surrounding lawns and hills of the warm cloth.
Volunteers headed to the older graves of the First and Second World Wars and from the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive when the kids played and held hands together when they were transporting a young pine to cold tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arc of the top part.
In section 60, where most veterans from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there is indeed silence.
The organization of services dedicated 1000 prisoners to the decoration of the department, but the gloomy mood of the wars that were taking place was filling this area.
Some were earnestly crying, others were praying, and families and friends were holding on to each other in the cold air.
Some read out out loud names, carved into stones, while others leaned down to see the little black and white names pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who would wipe tears from their eyes in front of their son's grave.
It was eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the last resting place of the Deputy Artillery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're single. My son paid for it, she said.
"Though I was long gone, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned the U.S. government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as reported by Foreign Office officials on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consultary officials, along with the American interest section in Havana, sought access to a detainee who was imprisoned on 5 December.
Certain charges have not been published, but under Cuban law, Cuban citizens or foreigners may be imprisoned for almost anything that is referred to as "hazardous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, are at risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and rumors are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to take over the prices, but the permit has been denied.
The detention of the U.S. supplier may be the result of an increasing tension between the communist Castro brother who rules in Cuba and Obama administration, which has been watched as "continuation tactics" in improving relations with the island.
They first reported the New York Times incarceration on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, the united states will take until further notice.
Cell phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in the country where the average wage of a state employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used after sending text messages because a 15-minute call would cost more than one daily wage.
The use of the internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign up must notify their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of US citizens in a prison in Cuba are behind bars for tedious acts such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, press office of the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
Prison and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say the free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, the director of the American human rights group program, which has recently published an adverse report on freedom in Cuba, called "New Castro, the same Cuba," as an indication of the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country and the replacement for the turbulent older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that all solutions would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative response in the United States, just as these two countries are moving towards greater dialogue.
Pakistani civil servants are spreading a conspiracy concerning the transmission of men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities revealed an alleged conspiracy leader regarding the sending of five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops there, and said they hoped that this case might help spread an extensive network of terrorist recruitments that hunts the Internet and searches for radicalized young men.
The investigators stated that they were searching for grey insurgent personalities known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men published a comment approving the terrorist attacks has an internet video site YouTube.
Saifillah took over the leadership of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get to the remote area of Pakistan in the native tribes of Pakistan, home of Al-Qaida and her terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaida commanders and that men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern Sarghody district, far from the horrific mountains in the northwest, which have become a refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
That's why they were dropped, said the officer who talked about keeping anonymity in the light of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that men were not intimidated and still tried to obtain permission to access Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the exercise of Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - emphasises the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, much more importantly, determining who is trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence has assigned the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaida.
Organization recruiters act as guardians, excluding those who are not sufficiently serious in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
American false recruits were subjected to a special examination at al-Qaeda, provided by analysts.
But they were also considered to be extremely interesting in the group, because given their potential approach to American objectives and their promotion value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older analyst at the Nefa Foundation based in the USA, said that terrorist groups have also become significantly more careful in recent years, allowing the rooster to approach them, because US intelligence agencies have acquired experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been followed so much?
This model is one of those that is far more web-based.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding a climate action.
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets this Saturday and called for a stronger action on climate from the negotiators at the Bella City Congress Centre.
The protesters reported the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police are pushing the number closer to 25000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists placed several small loads near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day when a small event happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city and carried banners with the English inscriptions "This is not a planet B" (i.e. a secondary) and one in Spanish, which reported "The Earth says 'enough'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensena, who stated that she had traveled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided me with information on the relentless state of the country in which the impact of climate change is still taking place.
That's a partial reason why we decided to join this big march -- walk through the world and appeal to the world's leaders to make a fair, ambitious and binding deal, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided.
The police prevented protesters from coming close to Bell's centre and said that they had arrested 19 people, primarily because they had either masks or pocket knives on them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate horns, activists masked as athletes and in black suits put several loads near Copenhagen's main channel, located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, said, started with lights, but then followed by "some big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate key officials, such as Su Wei, the Chinese's main climate negotiator.
When asked whether or not the demonstration had a constructive impact on international meetings, he replied to English "Currently, that is something that I was not aware of" (in fact it is something I do not realize).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is vast, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on the prospects of each.
It is visible the focus of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that this is a breach of behaviour or the freedom of others.
Date of test revealed persistent racial differences
The Federal Certificate from last week on the achievements of mathematics was a welcome element of good news on the public education district of Columbia.
Although the district is far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate has shown more progress in fourth and eighth grade pupils in the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the last figures of the National Certificate Centre for Progress in Teaching are persistent differences in knowledge between African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
In the last two years, the average result of white pupils in the fourth grade of Columbia County has increased from 267 to 270 points (from possible 500), but their African-American peers have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the difference in knowledge has increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress with African-Americans in eighth grade remains substantially balanced, with a deviation of one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white pupils was not included in the test results as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils of fourth classes in 2003, when the first NAEP in the district was implemented, was 60 points of scale (262 to 202).
Even though the results achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference was hardly close to 58.
Some educational defenders in the district have expressed in the last week that the results, celebrated by the mystery of Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more extensive with the white students where they were already high.
That would suggest that we have increased the sum of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality of participation in the district.
I don't jump up and down because of the distraction of two or three points, said the member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large) committee, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton elementary school.
Often criticizing Mrs. Rhee's governance style, Mrs. Brown stated that the test results report means secondary education in the city is in desperate condition and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the hammers, and I respect that.
But what's terrible is that we didn't spend almost any time and energy that we needed to devote to our secondary education.
Mrs. Rhea said that the effort of the district is to continue to look for better ways to focus on the needs of low-income students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in using new schools, Wilson's reading system, focused on students of higher classes of primary schools and students of secondary schools who were unable to handle the basics of reading earlier in their knee careers significantly fall behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics and mathematics education into the sixth grade, emphasizing games and experience of real life, which came to the district as former director of Clifford Janeyi, can be added to the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I think that we should continue to work and do the best possible intervention with those students who stay below the level of the class, said Mrs. Rhee.
The others stated that the results of NAEP explained whether Mrs Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain winning dilemma of Mrs Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of teaching at the University of California in Berkeley where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to target the resources and administrative reforms of schools located in the worst parts of Columbia district.
In this way, focus can bring political insights that are directed against an important agenda.
But the fine also belongs to other city directors who are trying to keep the middle dimension between the white and the black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We need to strengthen our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can rely on their children to give excellent public lessons.
Mr Janey, now head of school in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to exercise the right of schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to enforce changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his teacher's association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers as a "symptom" for the search for a larger increase in the next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
The bus entered Gettysburg College with a loud breath.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, got off and for a moment lay on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gracielini's parents hardly graduated from El Salvador High School.
Up until now, Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the track.
Now she and other eighth grade students in the group studied Gettysburg, where the school staff amounted to $38690 a year, their position was rather than scaring visitors to the enthusiasm of potential students.
Yes, that's it! she called Gracie, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the knowledge building.
Wow, really, she said thoughtfully when they gave them a low-level ratio of professors to the students.
Pennsylvania College was one of the seven who visited their three-day tour and were now completely interested in the future report: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is from where.
However, this is a bearer problem regarding the high number of born children of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from higher education or who are pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive secondary education and thus enter middle class.
In fact, the fifth of this "long generation" of Spanish college students - the remarkable results achieved show that many of their migrant parents, most of them Mexicans and the inhabitants of Central America, came to the United States without completing their college.
Their success story is important, researchers point out, because it underlines their point of travel forward for a generation that played a marginal role in the field of labour forces of the country.
Those who achieved higher education say that they had a natural affection for school and a natural perversion and an effort to succeed.
Many had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to go to college - especially if they endure in time.
If we take into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have experience and ability to help them orient themselves in the system, any simple intervention at each point does not solve it, says Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing these kids with a preschool network of all ways to clear up college.
The federal program that financed Graciela's dormitory tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems for the launch of railway training programmes, which start for students from groups with small secondary education incomes and continue until these students complete the school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, more than % of whom have entered the college, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education data.
Iraq's oil ministry has reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fear of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get significant oil companies to reconstruct their poor infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements were concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in restoring the Iraqi oil industry, paralysed by decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies have left with capital participation in just two of the 10 plundered fields.
Seven American companies paid for the second auction, which started on Friday.
Only one submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on a field that was crushed in June.
An analysts were surprised by the comparative participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry.
Iraq has finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here in the first place on the way of Asia and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online intelligence.
It'll be a long time before something else is available in Iraq.
Fears of security, highlighted by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely to discourage US companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has proven to be the third largest raw material reserve, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies were at a disadvantage, especially China and other governments controlled by energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more likely to risk because they do not correspond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that made agreements with the Ministry.
The leading American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintained close contacts with the Iraqi oil department and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts allocated at the end of this week.
The State National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers for more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts to two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become the main economic, as well as technological force, said spokesperson for the oil industry Assam Jihad.
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and will comply with its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were provisionally selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared by the Ministry by the price for barrels and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level on each field.
A top-level al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
With the impact of the U.S. rocket at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, a top al-Qaeda operative was apparently killed, as announced on Friday by officials of the U.S. counterterrorism department.
As confirmed, this could be the second fatal attack on one of the highest terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several missiles fell on their car near Miran Shah in the province of Sevver Vazistan, according to American resources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have described the missiles being fired from an aircraft without a crew type operating with the CIA in the zone of illegal native tribes.
These were led to a white car, which was headed towards the Afghan border when it was hit, by an official along with a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency who was on the phone from Miran Šah.
The official said that the local gunmen got to a point and quickly confiscated what was left of "totally destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. anti-terrorism officials quoted an unspecific witness who stated that Somalia was after death.
Somalia was listed as a high-profile planner for al-Qaeda military operations, who was responsible for the operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in renovating around the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be appointed, who indicated the sensitive nature of American air strikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was instructed by Al-Qaida's supreme leadership and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another U.S. official said that Somalia quickly proceeded in the hierarchy of al-Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a generally known person for some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, said another official.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaida or Taliban who should have been killed since September when Najmudin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the native tribes band, and three other top post-perceptive leaders were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using unmanned aircraft has been reduced over the years from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to the record of Long War, the website, managed by a nonprofit group.
The reduction may have reason for the improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also relentlessly killing people who suspected of being informants, set the page.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Kabul has resigned.
The United Nations High Representative in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would want to resign from his post in March to end the turbulent term of office, which has been wasted by charges of widespread corruption in the election of the President of Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure is taking place because Obama's administration has decided to send another 30,000 American soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegation stated that it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US time schedule for reducing the state that started in 18 months should be a challenge for governments of other NATO countries to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and send the right message to Afghans that they are to have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitments entered into must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed against the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian workers helping in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the part of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, said.
Eide said he was not resurgent, but that he simply fulfilled the promise that he had made to his family in March 2008, that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now stated that he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's high time to look at the successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban started looking for a replacement.
Officials indicated that it was a decision between Staffan di Mistura, who had Swedish-Italian origin, and had previously conducted a UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, French, who had previously conducted UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzam, who won the presidential election from masking the presence of massive electoral machines.
Eide denied these claims, but he said that Galgraith's accusations -- which was released -- "definitely damaged the mission because there was a high degree of scepticism with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide said that he proposed a meeting with the Supreme Representative of citizens to coordinate the easing of efforts to lead the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted on the UN leadership to enable its successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, therefore, he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide was disappointed in limiting his efforts in Afghanistan and said that the UN regulations on hiring undermine its ability to exploit its abilities.
The UN rules are that I had the opportunity to obtain only one person from May, he said.
It's a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon be imposed on Iran "another significant penalty" because of a lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in Northern Iraq during a week's journey across areas where they fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, has marked the prospects for armed action against the Islamic Republic.
That's not a good choice for Iran, said in the answer to a soldier's question of probable development.
One of the things that depend on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [this] is unthinkable in the war.
Obama’s administration decides on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that a "pack of incentives and restraints" would require "that the Iranian government should really feel less secure with nuclear weapons" because "the inhabitants of them will be extraordinarily subjectively" to sanctions.
According to the opinion issued by White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the administration has given warning to the European leader that Iran will have serious consequences unless it brings its nuclear programme into full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its Supervisory Authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In interviews in Geneva on 1 October, he suggested that he wanted to go back to talking about restricting his nuclear programme and that he would provide a substantial part of his stock enriched with uranium in exchange for the urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration found itself to be such an agreement as a way of establishing trust between the two parties and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems that Iran has withdrawn from the provisional agreements - partly because of this, the expert reports, because the Irish leadership is divided into views on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, as far as the Iranian stubbornness towards the international community is concerned with some of the proposals that he actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think that this has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together, on a journey which is not about terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, to Gates.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including monitoring, which the Foreign Secretary, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called 'degrading sanctions'.
In an opinion issued in New York City, the UN mission condemned on Thursday what it called "unfounded and unfounded charges" to some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and stated that it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solution".
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before he flew to the region of Kurdan, rich in oil, to meet the troops in Kirkuk and the Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
There is a high tension between Kurdy and Iraq mostly, especially due to borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts in order to prevent the abstaining of U.S. plans to limit the number of American soldiers from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to suppress the Kurdish anxiety of persistent depression. The official places of the US quoted Gates when he told the Barzaan Massoud, the President of the Kurdish regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, changing course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, on which they read that "the mother of the earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "one child also means an extra grave".
Then they learned that when the official government places in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth rates and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reactions were immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We haven't kept anything for others, says Wang, 31, the Human Resources Manager, who has a son of 8 months.
For more than 30 years, China's ongoing policy of having only one child has been introduced and thus created by two generations only notoriously bouldered and depraved children, and effectively named "small emperors", the country threatens the population crisis.
The average birth rate decreased to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the political community came into force, according to UN figures.
The distribution of the population, where the population aged 60 and above is predicted to rise turbulently from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the total average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is more rich coastal cities with higher education populations, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and above formed almost 22 percent in Shanghai of registered residents, while birth rates were less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning said, many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of ageing population and reduce the workforce in the future".
He says it's about being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden.
Gradual calming
As it was put into the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably still the most controversial mandate established under the communist Party's government.
The doubles that violated politics faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in certain areas -- and discrimination at work.
The Chinese official sites promoted a policy that helped the country to prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned in promoting politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortions during a second child.
Moreover, many couples had to undergo sexual selection abortions leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have gradually been milder in their opinion on the policy of one child.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions - including the inhabitants of cities, members of national minorities, and cases where men and women were single -- and in 2007 they mitigated their password, promoting a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the institution of population research of the Peking University, said that central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters, encouraging parents to have only one child, replaced by copies of regulations, detailed descriptions of how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officers and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and to put flyers under their doors.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, reports family planning officials.
A Sustaining Response
Even though officials in one rural town in the Shanghai area have seen an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the launch of the campaign, most city districts did not report changes.
Huinan County with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai stated that despite the campaign, the number of born in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in the Shanghai City of Caol, said that the financial considerations were probably the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like two children and was legally allowed.
But as many Chinese who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a digital network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the politics of one child as a disputed legal question, says Yang, a construction engineer whose woman is in the seventh month of pregnancy in connection with the first child.
Yes, we were willing to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just politics.
It's about money.
Other couples state the psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, says they only want one child, because she was also an only child: "We were the center of our families' attention and we were all cared for.
We were not used to provide care, and in fact we did not want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old translation company, expressed this much less than anything else.
For two career parents in the middle class who reduced birth rates, he said that being successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20 and 30 - year - olds look at their parents as the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism, and they do not want this way of living for themselves, says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on parents' time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still contentious questions about the propsor -- "You must rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You must have a resumption prepared at a time when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, says Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher nutritional standards, says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group has issued an emission reduction plan.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching undisciplined attitudes and mutualisation -- refocused on Friday on the release of a document that proposes ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialised nations carrying most of the burden in the near future.
The text, which can provide a starting point for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But it was seen that there was significant progress in negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who would arrive in Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text makes no doubt how much money the rich countries should give to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of key issues choices, including how to develop and control emerging economies, so that they can limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of the increase in global temperature, which policymakers will still be able to tolerate.
This adds a large dose of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, the head of the Washington club Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutahar, who proposed a six-page document, a removal from 180 pages of the text from the negotiations to focus on what the top climate official at the UN, Yvo de Boer described as a "big picture".
It outlines the outline of a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent by year compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
On Friday, the European Union has agreed to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adopt adaptations to climate change -- from flood and drought control to against deforestation.
Still Friday, however, he introduced the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed during the talks last week.
The U.S. Special Envoy on Climate Affairs, Todd Stern, rejected the call for binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries as compared to the volunteering of major emerging economies, unless financed by the developed world.
The shift indicated that Obama administration had established a tougher line towards China, while Bush administration officials were just two years ago.
The United States will not enter into the contract without the transfer of the main developing countries and the implementation of the actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure the restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of He Yafei told the US Chief Climate Negotiator that either the lack of "sel reason" or "excessive irresponsibility" had led earlier in the week to the announcement that the United States would not financially help China to deal with global warming.
With the future of economic pathways of major world powers at stake, tossed out both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States regarding the fulfilment of their respective obligations, while poorer nations point out that the two tens of the world's most influential countries are ignoring scientific imperatives to take stronger action.
Ricardo Ulate, the Costa Rica delegate, said that it is not surprising that major powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers from being responsibly responsible in their actions.
It is clearly a game of developing new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who also serves as regional advisers in the area of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to promote a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The alliance of the small island states, which has 43 members, has created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who conducted international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that the enforcement of small island nations "included a political pressure on the whole political process" partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations gave rise to new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the Heads of Government reach an agreement.
High-level officials, such as the Indian Minister for Environmental Protection Jairam Rameš and the Chinese Deputy Minister, have stepped out of the airplanes and run through the halls of Bell to the closed doors of the meeting and the new conferences, so that they could determine the demands that will be assessed next week.
The total extent of the assembly - when 13,000 people moved from every day to a convention center, to guitars playing activists made an ironic look at the countries they thought had sent them, and there was a hand-to-hand transmission on paper rather than an electronic mail - controlled challenge.
Intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier in the middle of 60 Heads of State.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for Global Policy on International Nature Protection.
Heavy weights are coming.
The British first train at 140 miles an hour felt this Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness on the sign of the departure of the train, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford in Kent to St Pancras of London and overcome 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed personal set outside of llndýn.
He hopes that the new service will bring Britain together with the international network of fast, reliable trains and will connect the great agglomerations of the Midland, the North and Scotland to London.
The abandoned standing waters should reduce traffic times in passenger transport and on business routes and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate traffic congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties were given the opportunity to gain this vision.
But the tens of pounds that are needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental damage now slowed down the construction of British high-speed lines.
The High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a viable study, forwarded its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as reported by the Times.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned high-speed network.
The new route between London and Western Midland was proposed in five metres in urban areas and neighbourhoods where it could be problematic.
In the open landscape was planned within 25 m of the final route.
HS2 also foresees identifying three choices for a large-scale high-speed network leading northward.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped conformation, where one high-speed line should lead to western Midland.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that there has been the most powerful choice," said the railway expert.
As soon as it's done, driving times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could enable passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals should allow trains to travel at 2250 miles an hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe.
The starting line is already being proposed to carry trains of 400 m long which would be able to transport 1100 persons.
Up to 18 sets could operate on the London-Birmingham track every hour.
This means that the London Terminal would be able to operate up to 20000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that existing stations would expand to the concept of a high-speed network.
Railway experts argue that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but the extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be passed before general elections.
Even if it puts the wheels in motion, the network should be built in pieces.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but already existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain driving times between London and Scotland for over three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial point of contact to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, an indicative point for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers paid a mortgage of £75000 on the Tories Oranges
Alan Duncan, holder of the front seat bench Tory in the Chamber of Deputies, paid the taxpayers thousands of pounds of expenses last year for the orangery he built in his house in the constituency.
spokesperson for the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs lived "from allocations", increased their mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-filled extension in their second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, in total hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The local authorities approved the claims in time, so it was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legg who carried out checks on the Member States' expenditures. Last night Mr Duncan said his demands "it made it better or easier".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
There is a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the financial office has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is referred to as "Orangerie".
The neighbors describe it as "a glass for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide some explanation for the increased loan during the last check by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last settlement of the mortgage.
The committee informed him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pupillary security to a mortgage of £271406 from his estate in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, the year before he became a member of the Chamber of Deputies.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan was entitled to £1400 a month in the interest of mortgage until March last year.
In April, his demands increased to more than 1,800 pounds per month.
The interest of Mr Duncan's RBS mortgage payments could not have changed at this time, suggesting that all of this was intended to finance a loan of £75000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage repayments decreased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, but remained.
The last document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1250 per month this May.
Mr Duncan left his work as a shadow leader of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed him and said that the MPs had to survive on the allocation after the spending scandal.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to live on the ration and treat you like you're with**t."
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and my claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
A Member, a millionaire from a former career as an oil dealer, was first invited to explain his editions in May, when it turned out that he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before the approval of the financial office that "it could be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug up a pit in the form of a pound in Mr Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he was entitled to £4,000 for a period of three years.
When he was questioned last night for an increase in mortgage, Duncan said, "It was because of an increase in capital, which was approved by both the Financial Office and Legg."
He added: "It is not a disputed matter of hiding and clapping or breaking the rules or something else.
It is absolutely equal to the line down, according to the rules, justified and that's all.
That wouldn't make many other ways cleaner or simpler."
Come and take a close look at the cabin on the Brightonian coast with an adventure calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton found a new meaning of life in the winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that stimulates dubious exploitation by creativity, called on 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas collets as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December when it allowed visitors to see the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishop's bread and cooked wine, provided free of charge.
The selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cottage represented the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, assistant to television marketing from Howe, is a priest without scholarship in the Chicago Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion much more important for people in the Christian society.
"Why should we expect that people will come to a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in a awakening way.
"Idea of the adventure calendar in the cottages was created just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and pulsating place and we tried to try and present it the spiritual way."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out to the streets requiring a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should have been accepted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police resources and one hundred thousand according to organizers manifested in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference to adopt an agreement on Friday, which could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilisation, which is clearly evidence of current manifestations, had contributed to the fact that the 'political tax' of any failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to the AFP journalist, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the parade, when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break the windows with paving cubes and hammers.
The police immediately hit the police.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of "Blacks Blocks", ultraradic separate groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals "no difference" were arrested and stressed that about a hundred were in bonds and in the sitting " held in the streets on Saturday night" despite extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade moved in peace towards Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate the building.
The podium was built for the speakers, before which there was a spiritual encounter in candles with the participation of the former South African archbishop of the Cape Town of Desmond Tut.
Most protesters came by bus and train from major European cities, and besides the Africans there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Korean.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue capes, formed the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning, at the call of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for a "righteous climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of environmental debt for the south, explained to the people of Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say, "It's time for that," said the Benen singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and waterflows are drying up, we can walk in them today, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the fighting movement for another world has approached environmental organisations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the characters of the fight for another world said that he had come to Copenhagen with the aim of "linking climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world".
The first manifestations began in the Asian-Turkey region, in which many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming are located.
In Australia, according to the organizers, some 50,000 people came into the streets.
There were hundreds of people marching in Manila, mostly students, in red clothes and with scarves that provoke the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada several hundred demonstrators have gone out on the streets requiring a strong measure against climate change.
In France, the protests organized by the "350" movement were attended by hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
A few dozen people met in Geneva.
Separatistic Abkhazia has chosen her president, Georgia condemns it as "frack."
Abkhazia elected her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognised this pro-Russia separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this step "frass".
About 131000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The election rooms closed in 17 hours GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhaz electoral committee, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closing of the voting rooms.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday on Sunday.
All five candidates, including the President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "is sorry that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian rule," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgalaze.
In addition to Russia, they recognised the independence of this territory with 216.000 inhabitants only Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After a conflict between 1992 and 1993, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia tries to show through elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, told AFP Kvarčija Světlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagapš.
She was one of those who came to vote in the election room at the school in the capital of Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the main topic of presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea shore, which can boast beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country with 216.000 inhabitants, huge billboards are distributed with Bagapš next to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials, who came to oversee the successful course of elections, had a warm acceptance by the district mayor Beslan Arsba.
"We Abkhaz, we are grateful" said during a small ceremony, in which we mean the support of Moscow and, in particular, its decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexe Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament and drank a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimbou and two traders Zausem Ardzinbou and Beslan Boutbou, criticized the contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract that allowed Russia to control the Abkhazia railway network for a period of 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he doesn't support the current government or the opposition.
A 50% plus one vote is required to win the elections.
If none of the candidates achieve this result, the decisive fight must take place within two weeks.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, events in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out to the streets requiring a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should have been accepted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and a hundred thousand according to organizers manifested the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, dealing with an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade moved in peace towards Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate the building.
The podium was built for the speakers, before which there was a spiritual encounter in candles with the participation of the former South African archbishop of the Cape Town of Desmond Tut.
According to the AFP journalist, there were incidents shortly after the parade, when a group of several hundred demonstrators dressed in black and armed bricks and hammers began to break the window.
The police immediately surrounded them and hit them without waiting, while several manifestos hit the ground.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of "Blacks Blocks", ultraradical separate groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
In the late afternoon, one police officer in the jaw was injured by a pavement and four cars were lit near the squat near the incident, which had about 20 people arrested for the result according to police sources.
We focus on the extremist groups, warned police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the police blew up again.
The majority of protesters who came by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were a lot of Asians, including several Chinese and Korean or African.
Almost 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue capes created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for a "righteous climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of environmental debt for the south, explained to the people of Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bová, one of the characters of the fight for another world said that he had come to Copenhagen with the aim of "linking climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world".
Oxfam has called on several well-known personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensena or the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson to speak to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asian-Turkey region, in which many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming are located.
In Australia, according to the organizers, some 50,000 people came into the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people manifested before the City Hall of the Philippines, mainly students in red clothes and scarves of the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta several hundred demonstrators also met with the demand for strong action against climate change.
In France, the protests organized by the "350" movement were attended by hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
A few dozen people met in Geneva.
The items of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general high school, said Chatel.
The Minister of Education Luc Chatel said on Sunday during the interview for the JDD magazine that history and geography will be "strengthened" in the framework of the reform of general high school, although their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of high school with a focus on exact science.
Now all students will have a second year of four hours a week, and for everyone there will also be the same program from general culture, confirmed Chatel.
According to the Minister, "it's necessary to end hypocrisy," because according to him, specialization S is no longer focused on exact sciences" but "in principle, there are the best students in it".
EC and L specializations cannot be for some sub-specializations, continues and emphasises: "I did not come many historians and intellectuals who would have complained that they did not learn geography and history in the last year of professional gymnastics".
The Ifop survey, which published the Humanite daily on Saturday, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) did not agree with the government’s project to cancel the compulsory history and geography teaching in the senior year with specialization S, which is why many intellectuals and teachers criticised this cancellation, both the left and some right-wing Members.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "no account is taken" to cancel philosophy in the program of specialization with the senior year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel prevented reform in teaching education, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for participation in Tuesday’s mobilisation against this project, which they consider to be offering pedagogy education to future high school professors.
In the framework of Master's Study 2 (M2), the Minister explained, at the beginning of the year, the admission test aimed at their field and at the end of the year.
He will participate in professional internships during the second year of Master's degree and the first year in front of the students will perform as a professor-student.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered before the admission procedure, you will gain more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, continued.
The Minister has also announced that he will propose "personal right to education", which is not yet in national education.
He confirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At École University, experts have 15 minutes to convince about climate.
Fifteen minutes to deliver the Copenhagen Summit's goals: this is the challenge announced in the Council in the morning by Jean Jouzel, a multi-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) at the initiative of the University of Ecole Normale Supérieure on Ulm Street.
As reported by one AFP journalist, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the 'Ernest' conference, which is a one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute contributions from experts to be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and based on which they would be more willing to learn more, explained on the occasion of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this seminar, who received a name according to the fish from the local lake, which the students named as such.
About 20 contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines will be selected and specified that the choice is based on their charisma.
About the warming of the climate "we can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic objectives in a few minutes" said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke to 50 listeners before without advance notices, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, stressed with the hope that listeners will know that "the Copenhagen conference is based on very highly prepared scientific foundations".
The videos shot at these lectures will be placed on the school website from December 15th.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February and the next one will follow the regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: anger of prison overseers, planned measures
The prison overseers' departments announced on Friday 'general mobilization' because they demand that premium and overtime be paid for their holiday, which for financial reasons was postponed for January.
The prison FO (2nd Departments of Supervisors) asked employees who would not have a service to participate in demonstrations taking place on Tuesday morning before prison facilities, and to "block" them and thus alert them to "theft of their wages".
The CGT for prison overseers (3rd Divisions of this sector) has called for "to convene meetings in individual prisons and start a fundamental mobilisation" with the fact that it is "disgusting and unacceptable" that "times and allowances for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays" worked in October are not paid in December.
The first Department of Supervisors, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "Calls for overall mobilization... in order to demonstrate dissatisfaction and indignation".
The Directorate-General and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased considerably in 2009 and not all were included in the financial budget, but ensure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The Chancellorship stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a message to the prison overseers' unions, in which it was assured that the payment would be made next month.
I know about the effort that the prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes to the Minister in his communication.
I ordered the prison administration to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation, which resulted from the poor evaluation of the number of overtimees, has never been repeated in the future, has been delivered to Secretary Alliot-Marie.
The December wage will therefore be low, with the exception of managers who receive the famous bonuses for performing their duties and achieving their goals, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those " always find a place in the budget".
It's just a scandal that got angry with the FO interregional union in Marseille and announced its decision to boycott into the appeal of "all meetings and appeals".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or on holidays unless they will be paid for these days of October in December, as well as at overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
At a time when they're giving us more and more jobs without giving us more staff, it's sad to let them pay the lowest position of employees, says the CGT prison overseers in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, financial resources are little, noted Secretary-General Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he's giving "better gifts" to Christmas than the ones he's getting
The American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, has entrusted himself with the "Goddess" of Oprah Winfrey's screen that, as far as gifts are concerned, has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get."
The President and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the series, which will be broadcast on Sunday night at ABC station about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious housing.
Even Bo, a small four-legged companion of the family gets his duel.
Jesus loves Boa too, said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog also "of course" will get a gift, as it follows from the short-term broadcasts of the show.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband's claim on the subject of the quality of gifts that she gets: "I certainly didn't, I gave you nice gifts last year", she teased the president.
Well, that's right, of course, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after that, he showed his finger on the pearl necklace of the first lady: "Who gave you this?"
In this one-day very relaxed show, a famous moderator, who has been actively supporting Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, spoke to Obama's husbands about their most popular gifts they have received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a round with a ten-degree transmission, but also a basketball ball, which dedicated to him at Christmas to his Kenyan father, who he only rarely encountered.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and the president told me about the basketball ball.
Only long after I realized he gave me the ball, actually.
The first lady remembered the doll house again.
I didn't know how to organize all this in my house, so I settled all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little doll house, remembering Michelle Obama.

Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles because of the "deception" caused by the larger operation he had performed in France, but the situation is according to his closest "control" while the RTL station stated that the singer was in a sleep to prevent pain and complications.
A 66-year-old rocker was re-operated at night from Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, after the American physicians reported "the betrayal resulting from the operation" of the spores that he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, he told his press department in Paris, requiring "correct surgery".
However, the press department of the singer tried to calm the public down and indicated that the situation was "controlled" and announced that a new medical communication would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was introduced into artificial sleep to avoid "pains and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll have a little more certainty, he'll deliver the RTL.
The press department, on request, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that according to "some sources" no training was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for a fenced fence.
The surgery, which was planned several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well-known in artistic circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the information of the RTL.
After this operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection after the intervention.
Singinger Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, said on Thursday on the RTL radio that his boyfriend was just going through a "bad time," but he added that he's not worried about rocker because it's a big fighter.
He called me right before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation there's no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on antibiotics", and that the infection was "stop".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laeticia, a singer's wife, and that he did not notice any particular concerns.
The health problems of the singer have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after he fell on his yacht.
Two months later, to surprise everyone, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small, thin intestine tumor" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
Since then, however, every health problem has been closely monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to comment again on the new hospitalization report.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Cup in a large pool, won the 2009 European Championship in a small pool in Istanbul, which he particularly likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, on which only three world records were last allowed, although many more were expected.
One of them overcome the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová for 200 m of position race and two other Russian male staff for 4x50 m of position race.
A great sorrow for Bousquet, who made a world record of 50 m freely, which he already holds in a large swimming pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m free way, the 28-year-old French won the final 20.53 seconds in the finals, in which ten swimmers were premiered instead of eight ordinary swimmers.
Bousquet defeated Croat Duje Draganja (20,70) and Rus Sergej Fesik (20,84), but he failed to overcome the world record (20,30), as he assumed.
We can always dream about something better, but I said if there was a world record within my reach, I'd try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing suits made of polyurethane, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
The combinations helped from February 2008 to 238 world records, and their era ended in Istanbul, which was the first to host them at the same competition in 1999.
This time, even the Germans of Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in a large summer pool in Rome, which had a world record to reach hand.
The young swimmer failed to overcome the record that holds at 400 meters free of charge (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew this time I wouldn't be able to beat the world record, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: the record of the Roman sarcophagus belonging to Zola was auctioned for $1.5 million
The board of the Roman sarcophagus, which belonged to no one other than the French writer Emil Zol, was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, which is much more than estimated, said the art dealer Sotheby's.
The price of this two meter long and 63 cm high frontal plate, originating in the third century of our year, was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "presenting four Dionysian scenes in a elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satire and baccanta is a rare piece, similar to the world is very little, perhaps four or five," said AFP on Tuesday, Florent Heintz, Vice-President auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby ́s.
The work was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still taking place, but it is an object that has been put on probably the most, told the AFP spokesperson Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The fact that Emile Zola purchased this marble was detected a few days ago.
The board was almost 300 years old in Rome in the famous Borg family collection and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorela, who decorated with it a bath in her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and shortly before Marshal Petaine's accession to power.
It's been overshadowed for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered in searching the museum database in Louvre that this album was part of the "remains of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the frescoes "Rougon-Macquart".
A busy attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions for the transfer of deposed President Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, were not met, which the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure.
After the phone call that I had with President Zelaya at night, all the evidence has been that there is no way to make this shipment, she said to the Mexican Foreign Secretary, Patricia Espinos.
The Mexican government aircraft that flew in on Wednesday to Salvador for President Zelay flew back, said the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The government of purgatory wanted to force President Zelaya to "demisi" and to apply for political asylum abroad only by giving him the opportunity to leave safely.
But the deposed president refused these requirements because he wanted to go to Mexico as the head of state exile.
The government of pustrates " experienced another failure when she wanted me to surrender my function..., wanted me to give a demise", said Zelaya radio Globo, in which he often expressed himself on the political crisis which has been taking five months in this central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar, he's delivered a deposed president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, and he's played a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept this because it does not contain an application for asylum, said on Wednesday, the Minister of the Interior of the Pučist Government, Oscar Raul Matute to the Hondura Radio HRN.
I will not ask asylum of any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for the station Telesur, which has its registered office in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I'm going as president of the Dutch people, he stressed.
The reports of the departure of Zelaya have mobilized on the Wednesday of a supporter of the deposed president who have come to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army has strengthened protection.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the Puchist government's attitude.
This shows their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who approached the Socialist President Hugo Chávez, was abolished on 28 June, the day he organised a public consultation in preparation for his re-electation, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica he unexpectedly returned on September 21st and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of here, he's going to be arrested and he's going to be responsible for the crime of treason, which he's charged with, says the pucistic government.
Mr Roberto Micheletti was able to organise the presidential election on 29 November to replace President Zelay.
In controversial elections recognised by the United States, but condemned by the Latin American countries as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil won the Porfirio Lobo.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelay's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street picks up, U.S. trade balance moves to optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and US trade balance results show an increase in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closure data, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68,78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological domination from 7,13 points to 2190,06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 Index improved 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from various parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added it, because the market is focused on "half of a glass full."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors mainly focus on US trade balance numbers, "which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October, to 32.9 billion dollars, compared to September.
On the contrary, analysts expected an increase in the deficit.
Imports as well as exports increased.
The great news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment has increased against all expectations and the number of job seekers has reached 474.000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "at the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also dropped.
The proceeds of state treasures with a view to 10 years increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday night and the return on 30 years increased to 4.492% compared to 4.408% on the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of supporters of the regime sang "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime sang out on Thursdays of the wife of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of the World Human Rights Day and prevented further manifestations, on which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Dam in White", wives or close political prisoners were chanted directly on the street by supporters of the Raul Castro regime in their march towards the center of the capital, requiring the release of political prisoners, a journalist informed.
Away with the Yankees!, "Zolds!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" chanted with a raised fist supporters of the regime for dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came to "secure security".
The day before that, there was a similar manifestion in Havana against "Ladies in White", but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, police officers were arrested in civilization of about ten dissidents, who were also about to manifest on the occasion of the World Human Rights Day on Thursday, informed the AFP journalist.
According to this journalist, the police have imposed dissidents who have been quenched by government supporters in civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours out of the rule.
Sakharov Prize holders of the European Parliament for 2005, "Laura Pollanová, whose husband Hector Maced, is serving 20 years in prison, has organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all of them, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners".
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of which still remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider opponents "olds" or "agents" paid by their mortal enemy, the United States.
Finished wonder, Cuban television has brought a report on the quarterly manifestation of government regime supporters against "revolutionary opponents".
Cuba and the Communist Party are regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disrespecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
Crazy guy killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the time of the peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary findings of the investigation, an attacker at the age of 28 reportedly attacked two knives and, for unknown reasons, an 80-year-old male in a pharmacy or in front of him, 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, this is the version of the police and witnesses.
A heavily injured old man, born in 1929, died of an injury in the hospital, according to the Alliance Police Syndicate.
In this pharmacy or in front of her, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband about 30 years old began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80 - year - old man died.
The life of the other injured is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently hit.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was transferred to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as the police source said, then fled to the street, still on the Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two more people, probably by accident: a 30-year-old and 40-year-old man, seriously the other one.
How it all happened is not entirely clear because it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher's knives carrying the cross behind his back, said the head of the Alliance Syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers, including young people, tried to stop and disarm a madman, according to the testimony of the AFP collected.
I saw a 30-year-old in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on Alberto's situation, a waiter from a nearby bar.
He was thrown by a crowd, including one city police officer, who broke his wrists, he added.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to detain a armed man and were injured by their fists, reported a police source.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
The people around here came to tell me that there's a injured person outside.
I went out there and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor, put him in a safe place, and I noticed great abdominal wounds, told AFP Frederic Allione, a 30-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, the second person, who also had stab wounds with a knife, came in.
A man who didn't have I.D. on him was arrested by the State Police.
The D.A. at Nanterre referred the case to the county police department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
Suspected attacker was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for questioning.
The police source did not exclude his location in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said that it needed six police officers to handle him at a police station in Clicha, where he was taken.
He was "excellently out" like "all the lunatics of this type, whose force in action increases tenfold."
USA: Polanski's lawyer once again asks for an end to criminal prosecution
Polish-French lawyer Roman Polanski applied again on Thursdays in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) to halt the prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to the moral aphéa that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney of the film director "Pianista" criticized three judges of the second county appeal in California for serious errors during the trial at the time of the 1977 events.
I demand to put an end to the prosecution now, and now, a lawyer named Hummel, added that from the behavior of the judge who decided at the time, Laurence Rittenbanda "was freezing in the back".
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) was supposed to have dealt with the state's attorney who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious offense against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and destroyed" (Roman Polanski, sought and requested), from the mouth of the district attorney himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared by the end of September that he "lied" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to bring an end to criminal proceedings, Hummel's lawyer will require a trial trial where he can present evidence of his claim.
The applicant repeated what was already said in the first state, namely that no serious examination of the application for the suspension of criminal prosecution will take place until Roman Polanski comes before the court.
A 76-year-old director fled from the United States in 1978 before the court ruled out a judgment on "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a minor girl aged 13.
Since then, he has never entered the United States again.
A deputy prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "to be there to attend a trial".
In this case, we want to tell not only Romana Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs Asayama.
He believes that the director "supposes kindness in court and despises his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision also stressed that there are other alternatives to escape.
Hummel's lawyer wasn't alone who asked for the suspension of Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, has also asked for the prosecution to be terminated.
She recalled that her client could no longer bear the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case was developed and added: "No one in this room can say that the process was fair".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26th in Switzerland at U.S. order.
After more than two months in prison, he was released to a house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is waiting for a possible statement.
Wall Street ends in no direction, it's stopped by a dollar rising.
New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market is thrown between indicators that are better than expected and rising dollar price: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closure data, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological domination he left 0.55 points and ended up at 2.190,31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in close range, the volume of trade has decreased very much, and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected, and which "helped to improve the market mood as regards the stability of economic recovery," an analyst, Charles Schwab, summed up.
In November, retail sales have increased by 1.3% in the US, and this has been the second month after and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the trust of American consumers also returned and increased strongly in December to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
Indexes, however, were triggered by a new increase in the price of the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "presses down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology shares are thus losing land under their feet.
The securities market has dropped.
The proceeds of state treasures with a view to 10 years increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday night and with a view to 30 years increased to 4.497% compared to 4.492% a day earlier.
Miss World's choice again in South Africa.
After a month of travel across South Africa, 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday are going to cross the finish line to achieve their dream: be chosen by the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion television viewers.
This great beauty celebration has been held for the second year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, and for the time being five candidates have gained progress in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Maová from Canada were elected Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real vortex of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth,Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had so many experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone shares.
The competition, which takes place in the Republic of South Africa after the ninth, will be broadcast directly from Midrand, North Johannesburg, from 17 p.m. (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country in which I would wear a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy I could have experienced it twice, and I've had Miss Sukhin's world in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was in a spirit of numerous encounters with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "land of breath".
After a month of performances, trials, meetings with the press and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes that she will go in the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, which also took part in the election of Aishwarye Rai, winner of 1994, who became both the stars of Bollywood.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is the dream of every woman, but it's not just the appearance.
We're embassies of our countries, and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, 59th year will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimwear.
The presentation will be presented by Chinese television moderator Angela Chow, former queen of the beauty of South Africa, Michelle McLean and chairman of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with the warmth it is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World Competition.
The candidates, like last year, attended safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on the bike, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual to the president, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010 and which helped the country with a little more support.
I could've met people I didn't dream of.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Tatachi.
According to David's son, Hallyday's status reports are "very positive."
The news of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive", as David's son assured us at his Friday arrival at the airport in Los Angeles, where he arrived to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday in his performance from the plane, which arrived from Paris shortly after 13 o'clock of local time (21st hour of world time)
The singer's son, who acted calmly, stated that he would "go as quickly as possible" to Cedars-Sinaï, Los Angeles, to which Johny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to an post-op infection following an operation of the unwarranted intervertebral tablet, which he had undergone on November 26th in Paris.
According to the press release, the singer was introduced to sleep in Los Angeles this night to prevent pain and ease treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was physicians of the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles already entered an artificial sleep. Hospitalization took place due to infection following the operation of the warmed-up intervertebral disks carried out on 26 November in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated again at night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a French lycea school performance in Los Angeles, which is attended by their daughter Jade.
The priority of the department of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology of the hospital la Pití-Salpêtière, Yves Catone, announced that he was leaving for the singer to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer accused Dr. Stéphana Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the Clinique internationale du parc Monaco in Paris on 26 November.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were upset, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes Johnny Hallyday's gone to Los Angeles too quickly with the permission of his Paris surgeon."
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone, and he assured me that this journey was no problem, which surprised me a lot, as I had suffered twice on my own from the threat of intervertebral plaques, he added.
A while earlier, radio RTL said that the singer apparently flew away after a Parisian operation without a drone, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintigant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic, which he was working on at that time.
In 2007, actress Charlotte Gainsbourg also operated to remove the haematoma caused by bleeding into the brain.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, condemned several times in cases of neglect of medical care, tax evasion and fraud.
The lawyer of the medical chamber Olivier Metzner referred to him as "a man without contrition", who is called "regularly" in front of a medical chamber, and which cannot be "really recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday about the matter through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure had "excellently good course" and post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic, therefore the introduction of the drone was not necessary", he added.
The health problems of the singer have been growing since this summer, and in any case it seems that his next tour remains with the question mark.
It is clear that the deadline for the renewal of the scheduled tour on 8 January (In Amiens, note red) seems too close, declared Camus.
UDF increases the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre not to continue to take their shortcut.
The UDF, controlled by the MoDemFrançoise Bayerou, reacted on Friday to the attempt by the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin to take the shortcuts of the former Giscard Party, with the fact that they must not use the shortcut in any medium under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to own UDF's shortcut, with the fact that François Bayrou does not deserve to carry her inheritance after he handed his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose side is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by a member of the Hervé de Charetta (ex-UMP now under the NC), who is crediting the property of the UDF brand because he first had it registered at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la proprieté industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday night, the committee of the UDF-led friends of François Bayrou, who did not intend to get their hands on him, came out of his silence and made a formal request to both the Minister and the Members to stop using the shortcut and hand over the ownership of the trademark, under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised an alarming statement that you will propose your political movement +to take over the UDF shortcut, writes the Association in its letter signed 19 those of 24 committee members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoD or Senator Jean Arthuis of Alliance Centrale.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place the name+Nouveau centre+ on your promotional material and on the welcome website of your movement, with the slogan +UDF today+, also notes the letter signator.
As you know, you have no right to use this shortcut, explains the UDF committee that requests the NC movement"and immediately remove all UDF names from all promotional materials including (your) websites".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over the ownership of the trademark to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will contact the courts in order to respect the law and legitimate rights of members of the UDF, they will warn the signatories.
In their letter UDF "is a full political movement since 1978 "and reminds that Mr. Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others in 2002 to set up an UMP.
Thus, the Nouveau movement has no right to use UDF (Union pour la democrate française).
They also point out that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoD for three years and to establish a committee responsible for defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the committee continues, "when he registered the trademark," he was no longer a UDF member for three years, but UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used the non-existent registration of an acronym to do so on his own account.
This indiscretion begins to turn into a crime, they declare themselves, and then they express themselves with irony to the strategy of the NC: "We feel that both in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to make a name for ourselves than to speak out of anonymity with a fraudulent acceptance of a name we do not have a right to".
Liliane Bettencourt case : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the condition of weakness.
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier and to sentence him to take advantage of the weakness of the eighty-year-old billionaire to take her for part of her fortune, from which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames her.
A photographer (62 years old) known for his photographs will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the abuse of the condition of weakness, a crime for which a maximum penalty of 3 years is imposed and a fine of EUR 375 000.
This Decision confirms that there will indeed be a case-by-case process, which can be referred to as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are attacked and fought for the management of the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
However, 15. Criminal court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, who should conduct a college of three doctors.
Grandad and the principal shareholder of L'Oréal have always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State's Office in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time submit a statement as to whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and during which period.
I think he's going to go through with it.
I'll speak to her about the matter, after the hearing, Mrs. Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman, stated.
As regards Advocate François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the decision of the court.
It's an excellent report(...). The expertise will show that with this old lady who needs protection, he manipulated (M. Banier), he confirmed.
It is two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter began criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-artists, who have blamed for the fact that he has spent years using her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in cash, life insurance contracts or masters' paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be a photographer, whom she considers to be a long-term friend, to be manipulated.
While the court had to assess the jurisdiction of the action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the Friday lawyer's trial turned into a family hour of truth.
Liliany Bettencourt's lawyer presented three letters to his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she expressed her distrust with Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to the lawyer, adds: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
Ever since she married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The Natterre State’s office once again found that the complainant’s actions were not justified, even more so, that the custody judge rejected her application to initiate proceedings for legal protection for her mother these days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is completely able to participate in the trial, is not under protection, nor is she in custody.
No one else will act for it", confirmed the prosecutor's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would speak at the time of the initiation of the trial.
The Manager Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence was unnecessary...
For more than ten years, the management behaviour of large companies vis-à-vis employees has been a reminder of the company's approach to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about identifying with "values" from the mountain, as was the case earlier when it was necessary for consumers to force products that came from the ideas of the head of factory technicians.
By becoming the centre of business companies, the customer has compared the marketing revolution of the market's strategy in the right direction... even when authoritarian efforts to force products, different from customer preferences, are regularly returned!
A passive approach of employees can lead to mortal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telcom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that affects mostly managers.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI "requires all stakeholders... an active approach and ability to predict" and requires employees to commit completely contrary to the authoritarian management revenue.
That is why we are calling for a management revolution to bring workers into the company's centre of interest as well as clients.
Relative usefulness of internal public opinion surveys.
Internal polls of public opinion - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will contribute to revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that the structure of the new situation will, after the different turns, return to what she's always done!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases proportionally with the severity of its failures.
Finally, because most of the managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of engineering colleges, they have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of their mental comfort, they adopt an old behavioral theory, currently re-invigorated by the U.S. neuroscientists and widely distributed without greater knowledge of scientific institutes and media.
With the possibility of moving "bars" (sic) the involvement of managers, Ipsos showed a recent survey of the agency on Figaro.fr, which merely confirms the managers in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating fundamental insight into all intentions and practices of the procedure: For employees, the commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation only deals with studies Motivatively functional analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a pre-defined dox that enables them, by means of a picture which tells them about the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, managers can control, predict and anticipate on their "social performances" and indicate their management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a living land for the development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
By speaking from Oslo, Obama earned right-hand praise.
On Friday, the American Right welcomed the speech presented by Barack Obama the day before in Oslo, happy that the Nobel Peace Prize holder for 2009 defended the concept of "righteous Wars" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who first mocked the award of the Obama Prize on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, former Vice President of the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, Palinová, a museum of the right-wing republican wing, for the U.S. newspaper Today, and she added that she herself expressed "sometimes necessary" war on this subject in her memoirs that are just coming out.
Of course, war is the last thing Americans want to do, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to be held there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessors, George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo, justified the sending of forces and used his speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Obama's next opponent, Newt Gingrich, evaluated that the president did "very good work" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was indeed a very good one, the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech quite historical, said Gingrich during the interview on "The Takeaway" radio show.
The former Member, whom some consider to be a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the 'left President' to remind the members of the Nobel Prize Committee that they themselves would not be free and would not be able to pass the peace prize if the use of force did not exist.
According to Michael Gerson, former author of the speeches George W. Bush, now editor of Washington Post, Obama presented a "very American speech".
Not only did he introduce himself as a "worldly citizen" as always, but "he spoke as an American president" and reminded Europeans that they live in a safe bubble that they did not themselves create, and that they do not do too much to preserve it," Gerson evaluated.
A few dissatisfactions from the right line include the Bush era hawk, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, who referred to the speech as "unitive, inflated and without inspiration", as reported on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, such as the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich, is horrified by looking at Barack Obama, how he justifies the use of force.
"When the war is wrapped in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the mid-left press holds a commendable view of the President.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the Peace Prize to Obama as premature, it assessed its output as "excessive performance" even for a speaker known by his talents.
The speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression," says the California daily.
Obama "speaked what was needed," evaluated the New York Times, and called the speech "for simple and informative".
Road carriers: three marathons to an agreement to save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three meetings of the marathons, road hauliers and TLF, the only organisation of employers that remained until the end on Friday night came to an agreement that ended the challenge to strike and the threat that was hanging over the supply of Christmas supplies.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau on Friday’s signature, expressed "joy" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the discussion, the negotiators broke up early in the morning hoping that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) resigned.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting that began at 11 o'clock to all agree and to sign an agreement at 18 o'clock.
This conflict "will hurt businesses very much" and "the danger of disturbing the holidays at the end of the year" said Bussereau.
The text contains a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (national transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wage increases from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we'll give our members orders not to lock up, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was hard to admit the increase in wages due to the international competition."
According to him, there will be an increase of EUR 170 per month for the lowest wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest ones.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a "advantable compromise".
The Agreement also foresees a 3% revalorisation of travel expenses and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the issue of 13 pay and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "reduction of EUR 100 million on corporate wage taxes" which was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on on the night of Thursday at the National Assembly Friday.
The government will ask the Senate for a "similar" vote.
The signature allows for this agreement to apply first to undertakings which are members of this organisation, later to the whole field, in case of enlargement by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "at the shortest possible time", assured Bussereau.
The entire process can only slow down disapproval by employers' organisations.
The FNTRs talk about "bad trade" because €100 million "has already been offered to the sector in the context of the compensation of part of the carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport has forced us to take emergency action, not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to anger turkey eaters at the time of Christmas holidays, she complained to Unostra.
For the Otre organisation, the agreement in the next 12 months "will bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field".
RER A suburban trains: weekend traffic interruptions, unsatisfyed trade unions with RATP's design.
The interruption of traffic on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, as Friday’s negotiations between the unions and the RATP management on the second day of strike did not lead to any specific results on the issue of the premium request.
On Saturday and Sunday, which is the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only travel between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation), each second train will ride, except for this section only one train of four.
The connection with SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train.
Trade homes Galeries Lafayette, which expect over 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP sought to ensure connection with large business houses".
Line RER A leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP managed section leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train of two was in operation and virtually no set was running at the time outside the top as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France managed differently and there was no confusion at the platform.
So early this morning, Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less people than usual, including because students and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he had risen about an hour and a half earlier to make sure he would arrive in time.
Saint-Lazare Station was not crowded, it announced the state railway SNCF, for it predicted a greater number of operators and guards order.
RER A suburban trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare Station with metro connection.
The next general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the management of the trade unions will be evaluated as 'weak'.
The Management of the RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains on all sides, adjustment of working time, career progress, etc.
That is not what drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (Jih Committee).
RATP has even put aside proposals on the premium for the time being, which worsened CGT with the fact that management "was not able to solve the problem while SNCF and travel carriers were able".
At the new meeting, scheduled for Monday, "the conditions for the performance of the profession shall be reviewed", stated RATP.
Which is why the trade union thinks the business is making fun of weekend passengers.
In the morning, about 150 drivers took over the business committee in his Paris headquarters.
The management, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, has therefore, in the interest of calming down, decided to meet.
There is a danger that the conflict will be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independent have announced a strike emergency.
The trade unions request a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, of which 30 euros of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Indépendants (independent) apply and complains about the deterioration of working conditions on this line, which transports millions of passengers daily.
RER suburban train drivers earn EUR 2200 to EUR 2700 to EUR 2700 gross wages and EUR 600 to 650 premiums for irregular working hours and for working on Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice has dissolved for the Kurdish party and this decision has serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to cancel the main pro-kurd party in the country. This decision immediately triggered a protestary demonstration in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can considerably complicate the responsibility of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end the 25 years of conflict.
The party to the democratic society (DTP) was dissolved because it became "a nest of activities that threatens the independence of the state and its Sunday unity," said the chairman of the Hasim Kilic Supreme Court after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when most-seven votes were needed for the dissolution of the party, Kiliç said and added that 37 party castors, including its President Ahmet Türk and Aysela Tugluková, were prohibited from taking part in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the assets of the party by the Ministry of Finance.
DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (from 500).
The Party's leadership has already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political jurisdiction.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Cassation Court, Abdulrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Party of Workers of Lebanon (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political vibration of the rebels from PKK.
The party assures that it has no "basic link with PKK", but refuses to refer to it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and attempts to limit the support of the Kurds towards the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP's management confirmed that dissolution of the party could lead to the restoration of tensions in the south-east of Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions under which the leader of PKK Abdullah Öcalan has been detained in conflict with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the decision of justice, thousands of demonstrators have gathered before the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakira, a large city in the south-east, mostly Kurd.
The police used tear grenades and water cannons, the demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails again, or they shot the stones from the washing machines.
She also demonstrated a hundred people in Istanbul.
Following the verdict, Mr Türk stated that the decision of justice was only 'prolonged despair'.
Turkey cannot solve this question (Kurdy, note red.) by banning the party, it said in the press.
The government, a party to the Islamic movement, also condemned this decision.
We are, in principle, opposed to the interference of the parties.
It doesn't solve anything, declared the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete blowout of democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can look forward to the reaction from PKK, he added.
On Thursday, PKK signed up for one of the most deadly attacks in northern Turkey, who killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow can come
Pretty chilly, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the FES technical services winter department.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time on the weekend, according to the meteorologists.
There are over 300 employees and 120 vehicles ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES shall proceed according to the precise plan.
Once it snows in Frankfurt all over and temperatures fall below zero, it explains Brauburger on the 20 so-called sections and big-scrapingers.
These sections include the main and passageways such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firemen, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and low-fall sections like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES will start at 3:00 in the morning.
If necessary, wet salt, which is better held, is about 1040 kilometers [1040 km], must be soaked in a maximum of three hours.
That's why FES starts at three o'clock at night, "to make the roads available when transport to work starts."
It's not easy when it only starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the leading winter department of technical services, 'cause nobody's willing to make a place for the sleepers'.
Only when it does not snow so much, are there a series of arrival and interconnection communication, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is by the side and by the side.
Brauburger knows they'll complain there.
At 5:00 a.m., footmen of the FES will take their way, and dangerous places and passages will be cleaned first.
Most of the time, the FES cannot take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which monitors from 22 to 4.30 above all bridges, says Brauburger.
As the ice is fast formed on them, the fuses go out as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
The police will also call them if necessary.
A bag of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: Animal long two meters and 1.50 meters high ran two strong back limbs, had a long skull with sharp, bent teeth, short front limbs with rough claws and long tails.
If this species were to live a few million years later, there would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday edition of Science magazine writes that Tawa hallae was but one of the first dinosaurs with these physical characteristics.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry area of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa is opening a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about related relationships, extensions and early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt began and other paleontologists began digging in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, it's an unwelcome for triassed settlements, informs a member of the Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identified scientists quickly as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected remains from a total of five individuals.
The finding confirms the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an unusual find: "The Triass dinosaurs are very rare, usually only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
Especially sensational this finding is not, but confirms some theories about early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, therefore the assignment of pradinosours is mostly disputed.
Experts are discussing, for example, when the lizards were divided into three most important development lines: carnivores of terror, which later belonged to Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor as well as birds, "long-wings" of four sauropodi and their relatives, and herbivores of Ornithischia (birds), including the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is after analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues the original terapod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae researchers found, for example, evidence of air bags, which also have descendants of the terror birds.
Airbags make breathing birds more effective than mammals.
The bones of the spine were partially filled with air at Tawa hallae.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive terror with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related lines of giant sauropods had later also air bags and light bones, he created this useful innovation already probably a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because so far known as the most primitive dinosaurs have lived in South America, scientists have been bringing out the lizards for the first time.
According to this, three development lines were divided early and spread from South America to all the continents, which at that time, as the supercontinent of Pangea formed a uniform ground mass.
The fact that the team found two other remains together with Tawa hallae, not particularly closely related terrors, would also speak.
The three can't come from one common immigration forefather, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of scientific studies.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One more older species, Silesian, who belongs to the group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonsky paleontologist Martin Sander.
His conjecture could put together a distorted image, because in South America a very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs remained, with rarely ever found on other continents.
As the dinosaurs proved that from a relatively rare sideline of the reptiles family, they evolved to the ruling vertebrates on the earth during the time of the Middle Ages, it remains a puzzle.
During the triassum, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the triassus, dinosaurs have spread around the world and many new species have evolved, while relatives have died out and the triass and jury interface.
History of success did not last forever.
There are two hypothesiss to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been mass extinctions that the dinosaurs had accidentally survived, but not reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs got better adapted, so they could push out the competition.
The story of success has not lasted forever, in any case.
150 million years later, the impact of meteorite on another animal group, which has also evolved in triassum and has lived in the shadow of mammals since then.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley, California.
They joined professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin, or Brem.
The police decommissioned Frankfurt's Goethe University casino took care of the global commotion.
278 professors and teachers of Goeth University, but also universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America have solidarity with protesters on Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "not approve" by the presidium motivated by police intervention.
Since the walls and works of art were tainted, the university president Werner Müller-Estler let the building be cleared by the strikers and lecturers last week.
At the same time, five students were injured.
The damage to the case, the signatories, do not justify "violent dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and police commanders".
Clearance represents an unacceptable intervention into freedom of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves for "unauthorizedisation and criminalisation of protest" and distracts from content.
The Presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The speakers call for the suspension of criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikers did not support material damage.
Authorised protest
Youth trade union organisations Verdi and the German trade union solidarity with students.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for your own future, says Verdi Alexander Klein's mystery of Earth's youth.
So far, the Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is defending the practice of the university president and police.
We're grateful to the university president.
The destruction and cast are completely unacceptable means, said on Thursday in Aktuellen Stude (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Land Hall.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said the member of the Earth's House for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fraction of the SPD, the Greens and the Line saw it.
The CDU takes the painted walls behind the pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and requirements of the students, there has been a decomposition.
Linke put forward a proposal that calls on the Minister of the Interior to report on police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For years it's been paid for a secret city, not accessible to visitors from the west.
Zenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly guarded location where secret military research was carried out.
Today, this district with 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, is considered "Russia's Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, the Greengrad representatives have established contacts with the French scientific centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FAZ).
There have been many mutual visits, and on Wednesday they signed a "The Protocol on Close Cooperation" in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg.
The Russian delegation was led by the Moscow Multistarist Yuri Rosljak and the prefect of Zenograd Anatoli Smirnov, signed for Frankfurt by the Head of Planning Officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FDIs and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
The FIZ companies will be allowed to be placed on a growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The county was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist planned city" for military research.
Zenograd (a literal translation of the "Green City") obtained its name according to the wooded hilly landscape into which research facilities are established.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be sufficiently prepared.
For project supporters this is quite simply a 'new heart of Europe'.
All right. S21 is more than starting a station, more than a monstrous building, which will throw the capital of Baden-Württemberska for one decade into desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
The railway head stations, which ended in the city centre, were then considered to be the 19th century's transport-technical fossils, which act as brakes of modern rail transport, because it took enormously much time to push the locomotive from behind.
Come on, stop for a second, move on - that's how it should work.
That's why the main station is disappearing: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the crossing station, which lies about halfway through the trans-European railway bus line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that's why the slogan about the "heart of Europe".
It really starts with S21, although visions from the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves have learned that the start of the construction is almost unfunded in the city of Hessen and Bavaria.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, the main station has no longer been difficult to ride and drive.
Yet: It begins with Stuttgart 21 including a new line of ICE to Ulm.
Earth's and communal politicians put it through.
The railways cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State company.
Urbanistically, the project can still be excused in some way.
There will be a new city space, which - if we trust computer images of designers - will contain many greens.
S21 is harmful for the rail transport system.
The railway station and the construction of the track are designed for passenger transport, which, typically in the 1980s, attributed a huge increase.
There was no cheap flight in that time.
However, modern transport policy must first of all be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains because of a sharp climb.
More importantly, S21 is indirectly touching many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros was to be buried in Sweden.
That's an official number.
Experts consider it a real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be no funding for other node points and close network locations.
There are 60 major projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of approximately 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, at a slow pace on this route.
You'd need a hard push here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The route through the Rhine will become the throat of a bottle of international freight: right in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment on the airport
The Government of the Earth has left the House of Wiesbaden open if it goes against the judgment of the Court of Justice of Hessen (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and lets it be revised.
The CDU/FDP Coalition authorised experts to legally assess more than 400 pages of VGH judgment, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel today justified in writing that the State would have to re-schedule the night ban on flights in the case of construction of a planned north-west morning frankfurt airport.
Permit 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as anticipated by the Earth Government, do not correspond with the law-entitled protection of the population against night noise.
The coalition must decide before 4 January if it will require a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticized this deferral and came to a representative of the government in order to waive the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to the promises regarding the ban on night flights that she had given before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to view it as "interruption of the word".
It's damn hard, if you can keep your word, said Green Tarek Al-Wazir in an appeal to the FDP electoral slogan "We hold the word".
Minister Posch refused to refute Schäfer-Gümbel, the government is trying to get to its night flights through "reversing rights and tricks".
The exact legal control needs its time.
Coalition doesn't want to work on the "fast first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The statements of his faction to the ban on night flights were never the ones given to the opposition.
The Bank of America is paying the aid
America's, crisis-shattered big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
At the same time, the Bank of America paid a total of $45 billion (around €30 billion) from Tarp Bank’s rescue fund on Wednesday.
According to a report from the American CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay state aid.
Thus, the Constitutions want to get rid of the restrictions that occurred through the adoption of money - the limitation of the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
The bank of America got 19 billion dollars of net money from investors thanks to variable bonds.
She took the rest of the money from her cash register, which was filled with, among other things, by trade unions.
On Wednesday night, the chief of the bank, Kenneth Lewis, specifically thanked the U.S. taxpayer: The money injections helped us through a difficult time.

Quick option
It went faster than expected.
The station introduced the successor just two weeks after the Board of Directors of ZDF pushed Nikolaus Brender out of office.
Last night, the gremium wanted to agree on the person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital of Berlin, was described as the favorite.
But the station didn't confirm that - officially, so there wouldn't be a trial.
However, the role could also be that they did not want to harm the intendant of ZDF Markuse Schächter unless this proposal was passed by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs nine out of 14 members of the grémium.
The result of the vote was not known before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter and his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it could be expected.
In fact, the EU majority on the Governing Board has been signaling for weeks before the elections that it does not want to confirm Brender at the Office.
Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch organized the resistance to the editor.
He refused to continue in the office of a highly respected editor, arguing that Brender's monitoring quotas for the ZDF broadcasting had fallen.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was severely criticised.
For the last time, even 35 state lawyers were involved in the debate, who considered Koch's procedure counter-imposed.
It was no use.
About person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for Südwestung and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referent to the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 manager and moderator of "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 head of foreign policy of ZDF; since then head of head of ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected a professional periodical by Medium Magazine by the journalist of the year on Wednesday, was deposed, they announced that they would bring a constitutional action.
Koch's opponent to the Board of Directors, Rinland-Falish Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal countries should change the state treaty with ZDF so that the personnel proposals of the intendant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF Supervisory Board.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, was in charge of a smart chess move by the board - immediately after Brender's dissolution he criticized the gremium for it.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him to the position of the editor-in-chief without losing his face both Schächter and he could be elected by the Board of Directors without the suspicion that the party was being pushed into office.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is so assigned to left-wing liberals.
The study gets rid of harampads
Partial success for students: After a year of strike, ministers of culture finally visited the federal countries: At a conference of ministers of culture and university rectors both parties agreed that it was preferable to improve study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the load by tests: In principle, each study module should end with one single test.
In addition, the labour burden of students should be reviewed and a "real and defensive level" guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of tests between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal countries commit themselves to creating a more flexible joint structural assignment for the bachelor and masteral fields.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Less testing
Since the start of student protests in the worm, ministers of culture and university rectors have had winged words about better study.
Now they're filled with a specific content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Board has decided that the number of tests is partially reduced drastically: "Every module will usually only be completed by one test", writes in a 30-page report, which is intended to partially regulate the approval of study fields.
"A markedly lower test load," said the chairman of the accreditation board Reinhold Grimm, "a misrepresentation which significantly reduced the importance of study should be stopped."
In addition, the "study of study" should be a "deciding criterion" for implementation in the future.
Modules and contents must be "severely re-checked" so that "studyers do not needlessly limit when choosing"
seminary."
Students should "put on a space that allows and supports their own initiative".
The rules should apply in the approval of new study fields, but also in the context of existing studies.
These need to be "accredited" every five years – but this means it will continue until 2015, before all study fields are re-screened.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to the accreditation board established by the federal countries.
Ministers of culture called on the federal countries in October to act on the agencies so that the filling of the utensils is not too large and the testing regime is not strict.
In each federal country, universities and universities have already agreed with the Ministry of Earth on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, the Rhine-Falcko has pledged additional resources for the further development of the Bologna Process.
In particular, universities should cover consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen test and foreign authorities.
The countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the Parliament of the Higher Education Act.
According to her, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of the studio should be even more flexible, to this end the recognition of tests from other universities should be guaranteed and the availability of a master's degree is to be facilitated.
By the end of next year, the intensity of all studies in the country should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition argued again on Thursday about the country's study conditions.
In addition to praise, the criticism of the resolution has also fallen.
The Board of Higher Education Groups, Juso, called on education policy-making not to take place in the future "at the closed door" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word" should speak to students as a person concerned.
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of Higher Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need students' experience", said she at one meeting with cultural ministers, with whom HRK advised on a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonish resolution has not gone far enough: They require a legal claim that would allow each graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a master’s studies in the building.
Second, the federal countries must ensure that, for today's generation of students, there are plenty of places at their disposal in the master's fields of study with the best possible study conditions, said the member of the Board of Directors of GEW Andreas Keller.
The federal countries must employ much more speakers.
Ministers of Culture, however, did not comment on free access to Master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Hert Müller
Getting to and out of Germany is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by Werner Söllner, who, in this most severed language piece, is about his experience of traveling one dissident who has gained his freedom but has lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a tutor to one children's book label, then in 1982 he moved to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner was awarded with various literary awards, 1993 he lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesen Literary Forum in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday at one seminar in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a mirror of its security act".
Apparently, Söllner left a statement in front of his fellow writers, Romanian Germans, such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, to cooperate as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Secure.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
They say attempts to recruit began in no way, first in 1971.
I am, continued Söllner, "so someone who did not resist enough attempts at intimidation by the Secure."
Poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent, Walter.
Almost at the same time, with the Nobel Prize being awarded to Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary settlement with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors originating in Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and shamefulness of the political system based on control and spying.
Werner is not a Söllner, at least if it can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he is also a victim.
In the files of the Secret Agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of Agent Walter himself.
"He was cutting me out" at all of his vital points, says Markel.
It has a moral duty to make this comment.
Söllner's statement in this form was unexpected before this audience, but it is completely surprising that the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not acknowledged.
Herta Müller wrote already in July when she read her own files, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Top Secretite.
The touch, you can assume, they'll speculate, and in some cases even know which name is hidden behind a cover called Sorin, Voic and just like Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, in the meantime a very certain examination of the components of the Stazi, manipulation with the estate control of the Secure is still very disparate.
Over the past few years, systematic education has been wasted and reduced.
One of the birthers' offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securities (CNSAS) components, was founded only in 1999, the release of the act has taken place more lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of the components.
That the former members of the Secure still have a great influence in Romania, following the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller, one interview in which one of the former Secretite chiefs in Temesvár commented on the winner of the award.
My psychosis, after all, was questioned only once.
The disillusionment of power has been expressed here completely uncovered in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, as in the case of Söllner, as in the context of a silent accusation, there are inevitable questions.
Why now? Who has been damaged? The special reaction of listeners to Söllner's confessions expects that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than the attribution of guilt and shame.
To the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Insulated deposit Champions League
It looked like a purely dressed sales representative from a cute Christmas party at which the manufacturer of sports goods was handing out sweets when he entered a quarter of an hour after midnight in the called Mercedes class C, the new coach VfBr Christian Gross accompanied by an orange coloured sponsor bag.
A man with a fine coat got himself driven around a foreign city because of him.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk by luck was also a 55-year-old man.
It's been a nice evening, but tomorrow we'll continue our work.
Or it'll just start.
The words of only three days involved Switzerland: "We have achieved the eight finals" in the Champions League thanks to the win3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the convention."
"More important task" is in front of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat performance from the king's class and on a regular league day.
And prevent again obvious weaknesses after three fast goals of Mary (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draw
The eight finals of the Champions League (December 16th/17th + February 23/24th/ the retribution of the 9/10th + March 16/17th) will be held in Nyon on December 18th.
So the joy of Babylon’s coming will remain.
Not only was he a supposed healer who, in short periods of self-confidence, willingness to take up and enjoy the game, uncertainty of Stuttgart’s professionals.
I went to the players and told them that they were supposed to focus on their strengths and I urged them to be more courageous, explained the soul healer Gross so simply to sound a successful recipe, which, however, did not prove any more effective as a therapist of Babbel.
"When a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedir, who, after a long-week break caused by the injury, became, thanks to his dynamics, the very best player on the field, tried to describe the detected "fenomen" by the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new superior: "He is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
It was obviously missing Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not saved yet, warns the sports president Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate victory against the weakened replacement and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won even in Glasgow, before the ugly awakening came after the defeat of 0:4 in Leverkusen, Khedir considered.
And sports leader Horst Heldt recalled that although one goal was achieved in the season, the other one is still far away.
We're not ready yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday after the first home victory after three months, was caused by weekend events that freshly lived in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that are active others, and not Jens, addressed Heldt to hard Lehmann's criticism.
He pitched the board of weak leadership and decided to change coach after the pressures of puberty fans.
Even the fact that he was canceled his free day after the fights, he referred to Lehmann as a sign of the lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "forms pure egoism", said Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
I guess both 40s won't have any more joy in their lives.
Anyway, they're for one thing with the others, that without the work of the established coaching team, it would not be possible to have a gameful and fighting performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "big share of success", they say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man agrees with the plastic bag.
The Battle of the World heavyweight Championship
A passionate duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world champion Vitali Klitička.
However, after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defenses his title in the heavy weight of the WBC boxing organization.
The referee's statement was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Kličko remains the world champion in heavyweight boxing.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday at Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klíčka it is the third successful defence of the title after its return in October 2008.
Before that, Ukrainian was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be the one everyone expected.
A click improved his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional battles, twice he was defeated for injury.
Challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th duel.
About 17.000 viewers in the Brno arena drove 2,02 meters high Kličko due to his left hand.
The 11-inch smaller Johnson, who announced the end of the Klick's era before the duel, was withdrawn from the hits of the world's master, so that Klíčko could not establish a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
In total, passive Johnson did a little on the challenger, and he was just trying to get into the next round.
Although the click provoked words and gestures, his strikes, but the world’s masters have rarely hit.
But still, it's only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought the Klick with 12 wheels.
The challenger took care of the riot in the Swiss capital.
He insulted the Klit as a "defying zombie," which "can't do anything right."
During the Friday, the champion got provoked, pulled the sunglasses off Johnson's nose, "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after the Click of Return
The click remained undefeated after the fourth battle after its return on 11 October 2008.
After a nearly four-year break at that time, he defeated Samuel Peter's Nigerians in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to give up without fighting before.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the USA.
In this fight, I only got one shot, and physically I'm in good shape, justified by a click of a quick return to the ring.
His dream remains, however, the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimír is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
However, the WBA belt wears the Brit David Haye, after he settled from the throne of 2.13 meters tall Nikolay Vulajevo in November.
Haye refused to fight Klick in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
He's reportedly planning his campaign against Klick at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kundúz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: The head of the faction of the Green Jürgen Trittin called Kundúz Minister of Defense Guttenberg a liar for bad information.
SPD and Linke (Left) call on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the air raid of Kundúz, the opposition considers that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodore zu Guttenberg (CSU) committed a conscious deception.
The Minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "knowingly false," said the head of the faction of the Green Jürgen Trittin on the Saturday news show ARD "Tagasschau".
Let's call it the usual expression:
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the essence of the message that NATO had that Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday it turned out that the attack was not only about the destruction of stolen trucks, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to NATO's investigation, up to 142 people were killed or injured in an U.S. air raid required by the German commander of Kundúzu.
Green, SPD and Linkede called on the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to immediately express themselves before the Federal Chamber and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel needs to explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Chamber - and, if the Chancellor's Office, Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, they called on Jürgen Trittin and a colleague from the Green Renate Künast.
Government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm has definitely rejected criticism.
The Chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, said.
On Saturday, there were also raised doubts about the presentation of the Ministry for the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneider and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from SPIEGEL, both Guttenberg were informed correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tankers.
It was officially said that they were supposed to deny the existence of NATO reports and silence the Minister's sensitive details.
However, it was said from the vicinity of the two senior officials that they warned the Ministry of Defence even a few reports, between them on the two pages of Colonel Klein's commanding document and one report from the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have requested in his letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any response yet.
The Ministry did not comment on the objections on Saturday and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the Federal Chamber of Investigation Committee, which will be set up next Wednesday.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in the awake state and hear voices that others can't see and hear.
Not only do you have a mental illness or drug connection, the boundaries between imagination and reality come together.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can surround ourselves with the wildest ideas and fantasy delusions.
However, those who experience the vigilance of dreams see and hear things that others do not see and hear, in today’s Western world usually pay for a fool or a drug addict or at least as a freak.
However, such images and voices do not occur only in the case of mentally ill or in a drug connection.
The wine has our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels will make sure that the boundaries between dreams, imagination and reality merge.
Dreams of altered state of consciousness may occur in various forms, in better case we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, however, the vision of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the Prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, shaman's states of error, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of neurol transmitters of the brain is derailed - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is impaired.
Comprehensive hallucinations and deceptive thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between delusion and dream employed philosophers and doctors from ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 "a great resemblance of error in dreams", for Sigmund Freud was a dream even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, delusions of senses".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and scaly colored.
Gravity has no power over it, it's floating at the ceiling of the room.
Feels kickin'.
Behind him, winged black characters with bloody red rubas, valued teeth.
He chases him, digs him with heavy fire shoes, throws him against the wall, feels pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten the wall and the radio.
He can no longer stand the voices that insult him and insult him.
Henning T. tossss two cables out of the stereo, throws them into the loop and tightens it up on the hook on the ceiling.
He'll stand on one speaker and put a loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop allows.
Learn how to cry out to the congregation by tearing up drums, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be treated!"
Today, Henning T. 40 years old, experienced six acute psychosis, the last 2 years, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD's been launched.
His diagnosis is schizo-infective paranoid psychosis, and besides, he's manic depressive, he's on medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, three years married.
I've experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubt, he says.
The Spirits Are A Horrible Reality
About one percent of people get sick at least once in their life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is after depression of the second most frequently treated disease.
When schizophrenic psychosis is acute, most of them cannot distinguish between the inner and external worlds, they get into a overcrowded state that can lead to hallucinations, sized, relationship illusions or illusions of persecution.
The hearing of voices is particularly widespread - voices that command, comment or lead dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not unusual.
The affected is unable to distinguish between important and irrelevant, the brain cannot filter off disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just as a dream opens up the psychosis of building a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Doctor of the Clinic General Psychiatry of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenik is located in the center of the event, everything has meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot actively form them.
Therefore, schizophrenia often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not mostly possible with them, the wonders are a terrible fact, the awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime, hallucination
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality that one perceives in a psychosis is essentially preserved."
Deceptive thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, and alienation takes place within a real framework.
Scientists are still in front of a puzzle, why exactly our brain is doing this kind of thing.
Exceptional states can lead everyone to lose a relationship with reality in the short term, says Fuchs.
Not everyone gets psychosis.
There seems to be genetic exposure to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only factor in determination.
Scientists are based on the fact that the affected person has minimal brain damage.
We believe that neuronal maturation, such as maternal viral disease during pregnancy, will be damaged at an early stage of development, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle of how the neural system will be broken, which has not shown up for many years.
The roles also play the influences of the surroundings - stress or traumatic experiences can be an initiator of psychosis if it is available.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
♪ When our brain's warm ♪
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallow expensive drugs, others spend money on drugs to get them, says professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we see delusions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and overcrowding for ten years, interpreting his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" last year.
Hallucination is one of the typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, the brain of a healthy person is hallucinating under certain conditions.
The hallucination, according to Kasten, consists of the contents of ideas that are normally suppressed.
They occur when parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or little suppressed; if our brain is flooded, or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs may trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, fear of love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to a third of the people asked that they had been hallucinating at least once in their life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-East Pomerania and goes to the middle school there.
Actually, it's a perfectly normal girl.
If there weren't any pictures and voices.
It may happen that she will be approached by a cologne with long, dark hair.
When she answers, her classmates look at her with a surprise - no one but her can't see or hear this boy.
This shy girl thinks she's an uptight dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows.
He's awake, he hears, and he sees the boy, just like he hears, and he sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It feels good, likes the boy.
I'm crazy?
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are rather daunting
Often there are overload delusions.
When he sits in class, he cannot follow the lesson as many times as the teacher in her eyes and ears just presents a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else clearly and visibly on the table of mathematical equations.
They seem rather daunting at night.
When he waits in his dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, he can often not tell if he's awake or if he's asleep, whether the paintings he sees, Grimas, or the girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and legs arise before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams at those characters.
My parents and my friends don't say anything about it. They think she's crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she hasn't lost her mind.
The delusions are also the art of despair
If someone's socially isolated or they're taken from him by stimuli, he'll probably have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I don't think the brain is busy enough then and it's taking care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned in 13 that the man she's been calling her dad since she's been thinking for herself is not her own father.
Because with visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain areas are active, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is hard for disabled people like Sarah K. to distinguish from each other delusions and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "it takes place in the brain, also reality appears there.
Hallucinations are also paintings that make the brain develop, which is why it works so realisticly."
Also night dreams evaluate Casten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucination of healthy people is not fundamentally different from hallucination in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises its patients to assess hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The border state between sleep and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world concentrated too much consciousness is an imaginary experience mostly pathologicalized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, severe disease, but it also brings positive, creativity - a delusion is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed, fictitious dreams, which the concerned considers to be real, and cannot even distinguish them from awake.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as patients with polyradiculitis who experience motor paralysis with full awareness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and by himself, for example a lasting, complete inability to move, he replaces life threatening the real situation of his own, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of border state between sleep and hallucination.
Since there is no way to handle a situation in reality, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will become present in the idea.
An intense form of support for senses and the transfer of senses in some insufferable situation that enables us to move on from our own ability to loss of consciousness within a moment.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a soul rescue action.
He was 49 years old when after surgery of the heart valve with a subsequent heart transplant his consciousness appeared on a several days' journey, while his body was still in the intensive care unit.
Claussen dived into the world he created, visited strange times and places: He became an old man attached to the bed, in the train sanatorium, a robot watching his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility that makes the drugs out of blood.
On a motorcycle, the Greek takes him to his country, surfs on a hospital bed in the Alps and meets the Korean mob.
Immerse itself in an imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
Dream is a different state, describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys after years and in irrelevant details are clearly clear.
Even brighter and more intense than a real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show the oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug connections, how fragile our inner images of external realities are even in the wake of the wake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
In 27 they are to take over the publishing house of children
The new head of Kallen publishing house is a transitional solution: In the long run Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he said to SPIEGELE.
Holding is to belong to the future 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his business for a long time in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at 27 years of age and have a strong will to enter the business, says 69-year-old man of SPIEGELE.
We've dealt with the details carefully.
The question is whether they're active in the company is only then.
The question is, do they have the powers to do this?
It is not possible to put 7,500 employees in charge of their children if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both children and business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had withdrawn from the board of directors since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Since 1999, 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the section of the Treasury added responsibility for the company's assets and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfero also Direct Marketing, Foreign, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Calling Kallen also serves to "cross 10, 15 years", he told Burd.
Holding should be 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that even family businesses were not sure of their demise: "It was always the case for companies that had been allowed to infect themselves with the desire for capital which they speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He's never had a dream of world power, Burd says.
I don't think I'm the political proponent of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the World League with "Time," these deals are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming up, and that's a time when it's appropriate to find out what celebrities are wearing, and to adapt their festivities to it.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which must be noted.
We're making a few suggestions.
Fergie's singer chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend it.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric motor
The energy company Endesa and Barcelona City Hall founded the 'LIVE office'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of electric vehicles in the capital city of Catalonia.
The LIVE Office shall establish and manage a travel plan for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensure mobility agreements, address, coordinate and provide contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electromobiles, collect views and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport of the future.
3 'Electric cities'
Barcelona, however, is not the only city to be involved in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
These are three cities that the government has chosen under the MOVEL Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Endesa's energy company has already signed a framework contract with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Region of Catalonia.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa's participation in the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and is actively implementing a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a peaceful period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the state's main export sector, is waiting for a "climatic period".
In the 2009 economic report of the Prime Minister Zapatero, Zapatero summarised the measures implemented during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would be looking forward to leaving, closing some of our main manufacturing companies", said the Prime Minister.
"Thanks to this plan and the wishes of the individual brands continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a period of peace in this industry is expected in the future, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Car Plan (PIA), has identified 800 million for 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies that have mobilised an investment of more than 3 billion Euros.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and of existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed government measures to support the requirement and mentioned Plan 2000E, which is applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and automotive brands.
According to the President, this plan allowed to reduce the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and provided a "significant increase" of entries, namely in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Convention of Classic Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, which is the room for meetings of professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Hall of Madrid Casa de Campo.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, where more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you can find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but also products of all types related to the world of engines in ClassicAuto Madrid.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures etc.
Hundreds of products related to classical engines, genuine delicacies for collectors and curious people.
The following companies will be involved:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Frankisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Clasicos, a specialist Mercedes Benz.
Exterior competence tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: focussing, sports performances, testing eligibility, presentations and competitions.
In addition, the eligibility tests for classic cars and motorcycles in an adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone will be carried out.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sport style conservation
Mazda intends to show that being friendly to the environment has no negative influence on sport style.
Therefore, Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start system - baptized as well as a quality-Stop-, which is currently available only with a gasoline engine 2.0 150 horsepower.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle execution, population, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent at Mazda3.
Front seats incl. driver seats have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
With the toolbox and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda is continuing in the Japanese tendency to develop futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us partly of the style, which also presents Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and, more specifically, with the Volkswagen Golf, who all want to defeat.
As is usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than sufficient space for four adults who wish a very comfortable ride.
In addition, a large baggage space and regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic engine stop and start system is available only with a gas engine for two litres and 150 horsepower and a six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very fine, characterized by reduced noise levels, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive too many kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a petrol engine because it is characterized by greater comfort while driving and reduced consumption.
As regards equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment it is necessary to mention in particular the RVM monitoring system, which prevents the emergence of a dead angle, the control of the pull and stability, speed control, internal mirror sensitive to light, on-board computer with a large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain sensor and lights, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels from 17-inch alloy.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped with a Premium Pack, with an extra 1,500 euro: adaptive light of two-xenon and a sound system of BOSE with a CD holder, except for other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is mainly characterized by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not visit more miles per year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a petrol engine 2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is €21.770 for Luxura and €23.270 for the tested version -Sporative-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a large dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L. A. has a red carpet, fine as the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the brand 'Nine'.
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'Lady'.
Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is only used to view mail, without the possibility to browse certain types of attachments or surf over the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine valued him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing him outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterised by a very low price and monthly payment, less than half the amount paid for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started offering two new facilities: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, for which it is necessary to pay a six-fold amount for Peek.
FonPeek, who was introduced yesterday at the Le Web event, is a European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It's as limited as its American counterpart, but it brings surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is around 12 euros a month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
Passengers with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or to look patiently for a cafe with WiFi (or Fon) so that they can view the mail.
The idea of a rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been put in place long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but, in my experience, one would need a doctorate from physics to understand them, and also a very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and consider various offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering download books and other search on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and applies when purchasing, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen once in the case ofFonPeek, it's the possibility of buying a permanent approach like Peek already established in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the phone mail, thank you.
I expect that, because I think it's the best type for the consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The Color Michelle Loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
To take Barack Obama as President of the United States, she chose her dress and coat in this color, and she also chose the same color when she accompanied him at the second most significant moment of her life: handing over the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellowish with shiny effects - in both cases it was a three-piece set - dress, bag and coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first sight, the first lady of the United States seemed to have decided to follow the steps of the Asturias princess and wear similar clothes.
The substance from which the clothes are made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of joining Michelle, she used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium high heel, now similar model, but in gold color.
They wear different hairstyles: this timedrdol, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have maternal problems.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in women of younger years who wish to have a child.
This is the result of a study by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women in Spanish Women.
The study was attended by 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities on the labour market due to motherhood.
The study stresses that at the beginning of the partnership there are many differences in views on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside their home are working part-time or have no stable work, start living with their partner sooner, before giving birth to their first child and overall have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnering and motherhood are delaying and having fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years of age with stable employment have the first child on average 3,7 years from the start of coexist with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted more to their stable employment and therefore had to postpone the coexistence of children as well.
The type of profession also has a strong impact on motherhood, although it has a minor impact on the start of co-operation with the partner", explains Margarita Delgado, who is engaged in research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of a child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
Differences are also between women of the same generation.
For example, in a 35-49-year-old group, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 or 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women get married and give birth to the first child before they find stable employment, while women with secondary or high education are acting the opposite way to get stable employment, before marriage and the birth of the first child", says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to her prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year the German actress will become the face of the different products of this brand under the universal password 'Cause I am worth it'.
The 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant international actors, is added this way to other famous L'Oréal Paris personalities such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before that, Evangeline Lilly ('loss') and Freida Pinto ('Millionary of the Cottage') joined this selected actor club.
The man's part of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by important personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey' anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's Partner in Lost').
British Fashion Prices
British people have a lot to talk about fashion issues.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, earlier and now - met at the annual handover of the prices that took place in London, atRoyal Court os Justice.
No one missed the meeting.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen the best model of the year.
Poker Manuel Vicenta
Manuel Vicent donates in 'Esa Poker' (Alphaguara, the illustration of Fernando Vicente) thirty X-ray photographs of writers he encountered in his literary life (and in some cases even in his daily life).
It does not do so in fearful and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but it looks for something similar to the core of creative personality.
The journey brings excitement, and the Vicent does not spare shelter or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading experience, even during repeated reading.
Here's some insights.
About Albert Camus: "I found on the pages of this book that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but the spiritual impulse, almost physical, as well as what I feel, but it cannot be named: the pleasure of being abject, the morale without fault and innocence without any god."
Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not the intellect, something between impotence and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been crowned by passion for this woman for 13 years, adultery, pleasures and regrets, which is a spiritual privilege to achieve heaven by means of perdition."
About James Joyce: "This one published in Paris 1922 Sylvia Beach. It is one of eight-thousand peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the northern side from which the best climbers often collapse."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He said about himself that he was the heir to the estateist from the county, another time that he was the son of a black girl with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was the great dreams."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught this man's crazy scream from Munich on the bridge to bring his echo into the night of the 20th century in his literary form, fleeing himself and crying into the future and speaking hard to worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One of them kneeled and prayed, "God, my beloved, make sure I stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave, Spenser's verses were carved: 'After the effort comes a peaceful port,/after the storm,/after the war of rest,/after the full life of death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In his luggage he also carried his depression.
The husband totally agreed to tell him that Eduard VII followed her between the azaleas or that the birds sang Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else was it about Martín Santos instead of targeting Joyce in Barojo?
What else was it Benet's business to get Barija executed by Faulkner's gun?
What else was it about for Cel to become famous for the glory of that man?"
Coward aggression
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother passed through our neighborhood, Fuenlabrad County, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by, and our dog, crossroads saved from a shelter weighing up to six kilograms, without a single word kicked him twice, and they hurt him badly.
Our indignation is the greater that we see nothing fun in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal, which was in addition to the clue.
And to that end, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, began to fear for her own safety, for such a demon possessed by a man who attacked an animal, is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, usually in a quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint with the nearest commissioners, but we doubt that it was something, and that we do not raise sensitive questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationalists.
Indignation has made us declare this fact.
We do not understand what is happening to young people today when they are enjoying the suffering of a defenseless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't understand where the right behavior, respect for animals and people has gone wrong.
Michelin and Fesvial together for use of helmet
The manufacturer Michelin in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial) has launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both entities have informed them today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of the use of helmets, as it is the only means of preventing injury to the head and death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin points out that this campaign is part of their commitments to transport safety, which means "more than designing and producing even safer products", and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this objective in a different way, i.e. in the form of instructional and information campaigns.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets when riding a motorcycle, under the password 'To be or not to be', is the first phase where in more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be deployed by the trailers to get to the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that the transport safety "is a constant problem" of this company, which is a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, the main objective of which is to continuously improve the safety of products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to recover.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain amounted to an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, a first increase after 22 months of permanent bankruptcy, according to figures from the patron organisation of the Anfac and the sellers of Ganvam.
However, the positive figure is better to quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling under the category of light commercial vehicles: car derivatives, pick ups, vans, smaller trucks and light truck/lifts.
And neither did the clouds that most damaged the demand, even if it was purchased by private persons, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies, and in 100% of the cases it is funding through third parties.
Other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a poor economic situation should also be added to the constraints resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the 2000E support did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention those who are engaged in a small and medium-sized enterprises whose intention is to purchase a light utility car up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions of not more than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam again reminded that special attention should be paid to the administration of these vehicles as well as to industrial cars (stones and buses).
The sales association assumes that in 2010 developments will be similar to last year and, according to the calculations, sales of passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system for hand-brakes is already mandatory.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, this will also be with the stability management of the ESP, aiding hand-brake systems, all of which will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, they already form part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while others have a deadline for addressing the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians, with the aim of helping to prevent many precipitations.
The auxiliary hand-brake system increases the brake pressure in the case of an emergency, which the system will find after the driver has hit.
But it can't always hold this pressure to the end.
According to a study performed by the manufacturer of the Bosch car parts, a third of the drivers who had an accident did not hit the brake before the collision and half of them did not fully force the brake.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires maximum braking system, reducing the vehicle's braking distance.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 pedestrian-related fatalities could be avoided.
The reduction of this number will be even more noticeable-by-counting would prevent one of the four accidents with an impact on the person-after the introduction of the so-called smart hand-brake systems.
In this case, the vehicle shall be equipped with a system which (using radar or camera) captures the obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver is not responding, even if the precipitation cannot be prevented, the device will act as intensely as possible on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors postpones the Opel plan until January
Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of the new Meriva will be launched in the first week of April - probably April 8 - as Javier Ortega informed, the US manufacturer warns that he will need more time to comply with the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to make every point of the plan first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the governments of each country in which the production plants are located, will be issued with a delay at the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, GM assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken in those days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American producer to take certain decisions as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to get Volvo, but is considering the possibility of a Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that no agreement can be reached with any of them, GM could sell some of the Saab’s assets to Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is still valid unless the sale of Saab is successful.
Ride a Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this magnificent model, the Porsche engineers used Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, thus showing only1.275 kg.
On the basis of this was, in the first place, an automatic download roof is in a canvas with manual control, reducing the weight by 21 kg; on the other hand, aluminium doors such as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; air conditioning removal, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a weight reduction of another 7 kg; on the installation of sports seats another 12 kg, thanks lightened by a 19-inch longer five kilos.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a dual-connected PDK transmission, one vehicle was tested with manually sorted six-speed cabinets, mainly on the second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many complex turns.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle does not print to asphalt.
Rather, on the contrary: we have not tested such a small and light model for a long time, which would also carry such safety when moving in a turn, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete capable of warming up the muscles while driving for a long time until we order it sprint, braking, and restoring the use of the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the steering that's so communicative as accurate, whatever we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, is what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Engine sound by choice
The sound of the V6 boxer, 320 horsepower (by 10 more than Boxster S) is a great gift and it is possible to strengthen it with the "sport" options and through a system that modifys the sound of the engine that was previously used with Panama.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether in suction or in recuperation.
The curtains are fixed, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we're driving through with Boxster Spyder has been pretty damaged, but the car's good with the lifts.
The electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; while in some turns we hit the frost and gravel at dawn even in an advanced morning.
Ultimately, this ultra-light car is one of the funniest on the market, because it's a little more than just the modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of EUR 70.831.
'Bag Girl'
A friend of Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon series, and an occasional "starlette" on the shows of the company, the singer shows his face to the evil girl as vehemently as his purses Chanel.
More than "Bad Girl" or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Basconia has won a victory in Israel
In spite of the numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, she was led by her group after the large performance of Mirzy Teletovice, which with eight triple points was announced the best in the team (29 reviews).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertase, or Mic's big dose of deployment and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the high accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points was a lot involved in the final triumph.
The match began with a face for the blue, who from the beginning stood on the mark.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance already indicated that they had attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooter 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alaskan team decided to play Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was accepted by whistle and applause when returning to their original premises to increase the advantage before the break (34-43).
Teletonic was already showing up as the best in his team with 13 points, although there were no six' points in Splitter's evaluation, it already suggested that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But even though the match was sharp until break, it was not decided in the smallest and the Macabaeans wanted to remind Vitoria that they did not win on their field, and they were able to win with Elías' hand.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to returning the yellow to the sun (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, the injury, but not at all dead, needed a few precise games to take a breath, and in this there appeared the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, which three triples almost each other and with the help of English and Ribas returned the score to the calming number (54-67), which reached the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavs have been skinned in the last part, and the English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to take them away from their well-deserved results for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
In spite of this, and with Splitter voted out for the foul sevanovic, they did not rush and defend well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already been won by the winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injury prevents Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left him to lead the B group in Euroliza in a fight that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but especially by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
Malaga's team has not been afraid of the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or opponent, perhaps one of the more ill in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusans to dream. An aggressive defense and three triple points at each other, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guilles Rubia, lit up the field with 12-18, a minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja , although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourousius, Vujcica and Schortsanitis, turned score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the resistance from the USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek teams have started to work and have demonstrated their predominance in both zones, where the absence of English beer due to Joel Freeland's injuries and the three personal errors of Carlos Jiménez have burdened Unicaja
Between internal players and the Lithuanian wing of Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage of 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible Retribution
The third part was very offensive by the Olympics, who, although he lost by 19, proved to be superior and could even offset the difference from the game in Malaz Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of the Scottish beer Robert Archibald, who was injured during the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja thanks to the leadership and triple points of Cook and Lewis' contribution, she left a certain hope for winning 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because the Olympiacos proved unstoppable thanks to the strengthening and overweight of the centimetres in his zone.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to balance the basket overage 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja sink and handed over the lead of the Olympics.
How much should you collect for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, search engine with the largest number of classified ads in the real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The tool how much should you take? calculates user salaries based on more than 140 000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where you need to put a profession, years of experience, age and city where the interested person wishes to work.
Within a week of running the application, the search engine found that a Spanish worker generally "feels unremunerated", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the product Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes EUR 45.226 gross annually and EUR 31.059 French, while Spain receives EUR 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has EUR 34.247 net annual salary in England, EUR 25.751 in France and EUR 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the highest-paid waiter’s work with EUR 11592 per year is paid in Spain, followed by a seller with EUR 14.725 and a worker with EUR 15.667.
The most sought-after employment on the network in the last three months is driver, part-time employment and social worker.
Brazil has set the date of Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government set a deadline for Manuel Zelay to remain at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate is officially terminated.
Francisco Catunda, the Chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Dutch capital, confirmed to TV Globe that "Mel" knew that he had to leave the embassy until that date, where he had been hiding since September 21st.
"He is aware that on 27 January following the end of his mandate he must leave looking for another refuge."
The station also quoted an ex-state who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government", said Zelay by phone.
After the elections of November 29 (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that it would last until January at the Brazilian embassy.
However, the same week he tried to gain refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya refused the condition of political asylum, which the government "de facto" was trying to impose on him, which was chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wine and rose since last spring, when asset inflation was a dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty appeared again in the markets, which should not be surprising because it is already a natural situation in an environment where the players take decisions on the future that is uncertain about themselves.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was the cashing of debt by direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at the nearest exchange rate, so that financial institutions could buy assets at a discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been virtually over and without questioning their uncoordinated liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a little bit of sand at the edge, as the Spanish Central Bank has done with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain an economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are taking part in the return of a reduction in risk income.
The movement of the stock exchange and the differences between bond companies have regained points, although they are still very remote to the abnormal level reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise private risks, which again affected public debt.
The US, Japan and Germany once again have become a refuge for selected investors, which has extended the differentiation of euro area countries towards Germany.
Spain has almost not been affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the reduction in the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useful for the silence of moral risk advocates who have tried again to burden the conscience of those responsible for global economic policy because of the inconsistencies in restricting the credit for employment when, in fact, a new thanksgiving day would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between the emirs for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that covers deficits, elections, and the new government proceeds.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with foreign payments at the start of the year and to allow the euro-member country to fail to fulfil its obligations.
What is logical, however, is for Ecofin to force the Greek Government to be transparent and to bind its own citizens to joint responsibility in the need for exceptional measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If we are expected to be before the transitional risk premium normalisation period, some of the excesses in the supported positions would be within the expectations.
In Spanish, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as European companies' bonds, we do not have to worry.
If Europe's differences are reduced and ours continues to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is just anecdotes. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to preface their reintroduction scenarios and review their 2011 growth scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, this does not give the Spanish economy much hope of living to meet this warning.
Looks like it's gonna be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets again, though for now, "suddenly, my friend."

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene in front of the subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies to discuss the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades.
After his intervention followed by the speech by President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villasica, Galán made several comments to the press about the proposal submitted by the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and an additional EUR 60,000 from that date until 2030 if the nuclear power plants that are currently in operation are still in operation.
If this did not happen, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million but 95.000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrol considers that investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections in the next decade.
The issue has changed since 2020 and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supporting energy".
The Galán, who considers that the bill on sustainable economics just approved by the government corresponds to the line required by the company, did not want to release a live as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his opinion, the "clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite the "extensive" measures, as President Iberdrol called them.
Whatever the case, Galán considers that the investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken now, because their ripening is ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed for their initiation.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary Ferrovial will play a preferential partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet reached economic deadlines, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a cooperation protocol to establish a Centre for Smart Infrastructure Innovation
The association assumes an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% are Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona is looking for her first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Accion is fighting for his first concession on the highway in Australia, a market where he already works as an energy and water business.
The construction is estimated at $1,700 million (about €1,047 million).
Her opponents are Bouygues and Hochtief, France.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest option to the establishment of Actiona in this country as a construction and concession highway company.
The Town Hall wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initial in English) for further development of the project in the business plan provided by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of tolls.
The bids are expected to be submitted in May, and the expected investment will reach $1,700 million (EUR 1.047 million) and in the final stage three companies with significant presence in European buildings.
The Transcity group leads Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, and the second based in Italy is one of the largest European specialists on underground buildings.
Against the Accion Group, North Direct is in play with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group that went through the sieve is called LBRJV and is involved in the Australian capital Leighton (the daughter of the German construction company Hochtief, the represented ACS), also local Baulderstone (the property of the German bilfinger Berger) and a major civil construction company Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large constructions and privatisations, but it carries a clear difficulty to enter in a way other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
In addition to the Asian references, the strategy followed by the mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner quoted by Leighton.
Monetary assets
Accion is betting on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activities of the energy supplier and in the salt market.
Other assets include the largest windmill in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, leading a group of companies that build and manage desaluation facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the areas of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground road toll, which is promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority, called Northern Link (North Link), is to link the western highway from Toowong with the route in Kelvin Grove (see map) within 5 kilometres of the tunnel. It is the largest event to reduce Brisbane traffic congestion.
The calendar established by the local administration plans to award for summer 2010 and to start work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would be opened in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the work is planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to project in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (€308 million) for its financing.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia continues to bring significant profits to Hochtief as it announced yesterday a government contract estimated at 154 million.
The share ACS will operate through its local Leighton subsidiary infrastructure of the national wide band network with an optical fiber cable.
This situation will allow 400,000 people to quickly access the Internet and provide the German company with a job for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left King George Tower construction project on 27 floors in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work was about to start and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
The FCC was assigned a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC received EUR 64.5 million of allocation of the construction of the tunnel with a length of 2.1 kilometres for the motorway in Slovenia through its Alpine subsidiary.
The company received a contract several days after the completion of the work on the extension of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, the Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is planned at the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Rushmore got an ad in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services to Sra in the last two years. Rushmore informed the railway company for an approximate amount of EUR 3 million per year.
The contract includes the possibility of extending by 12 months each year. The Rushmore was selected among the 16 agencies that introduced themselves in the competition launched by Renfe, four of which made their final progress, among them TBWA , which was responsible for creating advertising in the last three years.
From this moment on, Sra. Rushmore will take care of designing and producing campaigns.
Penalty 63 million for France Télécom for the Braking of Competition
The Competition Regulatory Authority in France imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions that belong to the country.
According to this institution, the operator restricted the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes to the consumer at the edge of regulation.
This sanction was made by the former French monopoly and the state company still bought more than EUR 560 million of fines since 1994 to impose obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased since the Authority, which oversees competition, considers that France Télécom committed a similar infringement as in the past and therefore there was a recurrence.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened online traffic in order to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
Since the beginning, Orange will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for entry to other countries such as Spain.
Play in the Champions League brought from the beginning 476,4 million Madrid and Barçe
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its founding in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The letter leads Manchester United.
The letter leads Manchester United.
The UEFA Champions League won is not only a glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
Only to the extent that the competition divided EUR 5.362.5 million between 105 cooperatives (of which 12 Spanish) that participated in this event since the start of the 1992/1993 tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money it won for the participation, and the only one along with AC Milan who won three major prizes.
The Catalan contemporary champion and the last winner of the lost European Cup in 1992 is in the fifth grade.
The list is run by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two teams that, in addition, charged the most money for participating in the last Liza champions.
And even though she lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only a third country that has won the most money through the Champions, although it has won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seeming paradox is explained by a complicated procedure in the distribution of money used by UEFA.
For this accounting year, Michel Platini is planning to make 1.090 million for Champions League.
Out of this money UEFA devotes 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (except another Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have achieved participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, except for the additional EUR 550,000 for each match they participate in.
There are also prizes for winning (EUR 800,000) and for drawing ($400,000 for each team). The eight finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter-finalists 3 million.
Each of the last four gets 4 million.
The champion will make 9 million while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
In this way, the club will make at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Supercup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments, to which 337,8 million are intended.
This money shall be shared according to the relative value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the mains and has four assigned seats.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20%, and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group published yesterday details of the offer to purchase shares with which it wants to score a peak between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not oblige the making of a public tender for the acquisition of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share which would be paid in ten years and would pay interest on this deferral1% per year.
Yesterday the Sos shares ended trading at EUR 1,85; therefore, Nueva Rumasa’s offer evaluates the company by 18% below the market value.
According to Nueva Rumas, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight out of 15 members of the board.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in the shares.
The CNMV claimed that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateo confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If purchase is made, the price would be 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, the sauce continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to stay at the margins of possible offers to purchase and settle the judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, the brothers of Jesús and Jaime Salazar, the election of María Jorda was announced as Head of Internal Audit.
This decision makes it the first woman to hold a high profile in a food business.
It's a newly created place that's going to come directly to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the polemics, since the company is still immersed in the legal battle for an alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos by the companies of the Salazar brothers.
De facto, the possibility that Sos will reveal new transfers of funds in the coming months cannot be punished.
As regards the credit of the Salazars, yesterday, former members of the Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) have testified that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises the exclusion option of the Patternina which participated in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorised an exclusion involving Inversor Mer against Federic Paternin on 9 October.
The supervisory authority has explained that it authorises this operation because it understands that its conditions correspond to the applicable standards and considers that the content of the 'sustain' explanatory brochures submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December is sufficient.
The CNMV specified that the offer is aimed at obtaining 550.008 shares of Federic Paterninin for a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital consisting of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbau.
It further explained that 5592.778 million shares were disengaged and could not be transferred in any way until an offer was concluded that it was specified that the price was established by the Federation of Patternin in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New instruments for the valuation of cars
These days of storms and accidents make not only autoservices.
Each is a day of thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event being taken to the service, where the expert must estimate damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and the time of the workforce can be long and difficult work.
It can take two or three hours to calculate manually the repair costs from EUR 20,000 to EUR 30,000, including parts and workforce.
However, with the support of new computer tools it would be a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this kind of system.
Service providers and solutions for the estimation of insurance and maintenance events shall be dedicated to the collection of information that manufacturers provide to them in order to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, the American group Solera is a leading company; 80% of the rating is done with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of valuation tools and the development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, the business director of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data for processing is still increasing as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been reported over the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
Once a new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
This is very hot work because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and the price determined.
In addition, "smart" graphic processing is carried out for each model, where it is possible to "switch out" individual parts of tourist cars.
When it comes to a model with massive sales, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about include Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini for example.
In terms of a mobile park, 99% are in circulation.
For the production of documentation and databases, Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each specializes in specific brands.
National headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical specialists) working at the same time with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data are included each month and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this enormous information stream enables businesses to make different use and supply of different products.
The most frequent uses are focused on repairing and maintenance, but according to countries there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the vehicle's sales or residual value.
The only company with a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but it does in the United States.
Given the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get the support that professionals in the sector can use.
This company offers ten different tools, with AudaPlus as a star product, a standard solution for the valuation of insurance events for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it also includes time for repairs estimated by the manufacturer or the valet.
This instrument shall be valid for each assessment.
The highest price is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it little, up to a maximum of ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the full identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only on the basis of the first number of the chassis.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet, which allows to disable vehicles with an overall insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying the tendency, making geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations according to marks or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of certain brands have undergone service because of the accident or how many serious insurance events have suffered in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such instruments.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to works or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is the company of the Einsa Group established in 1971 as a provider of services and a solution to damage assessment, accident or car maintenance
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in the service, 3,500 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover increased by 20% per year over the last three years and in 2008 they charged EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalizing the installation of the Paris office began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources 62% of its brother is created in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33.000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
Soler's global billing (Audatex, Sidexa, Informationex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will make €19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group stood at a $1,000 million stock exchange, and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auctioning of damaged vehicles
Last October, Solera bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation envisaged an advance of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This service of valuation and purchase and sale is only guaranteed to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, the sale of spare parts and professional dealers who have to register prior to the opening of operations.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered dealers and 4,000 experts.
They manage 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish Act, a car whose chassis number has been disabled cannot return to service, but may be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may have authorised operations, although they have been eliminated, after a preliminary procedure.
The service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user receives the budget only in four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for a spare part, budget creation and budget generation.
The ease of use is a crucial condition for these systems, especially for the belief of professionals of a higher age who are more or less observant when using new driving techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, of which 666 tourists, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 supplies and 44 truck.
Naturally, a computer with internet connection is required for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphic display of the model appears and the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables as the cost of the workforce, surcharges or discounts, and then print and pass on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an instrument for valuation as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between both systems is that it is oriented to service and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The costs of using this workshop tool are EUR 350 per year which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working on making this view three-dimensional.
This is the innovation that mechanics welcome because it allows for example to select the door and turn it around to display the inner side.
