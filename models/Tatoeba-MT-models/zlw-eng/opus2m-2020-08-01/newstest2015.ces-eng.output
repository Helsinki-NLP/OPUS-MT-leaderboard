Petr Čech: Transfer at the last minute?
Maybe it's everything.
Today is the last day you can jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
Another chance won't come in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently the chelsea goaltender, is not sitting on the new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco, or Paris.
He sits in a mixed NH Hotel, talks to Czech journalists and is preparing with the Czech representative for the game general with Americans and then also for the sharp start of the qualification of Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea's new season, the Premier League prefers Thibaut Courtois, the Czech Republic for the first time in ten years in London's club has become an alternate.
Some time ago, it was speculative that Real Madrid might be interested in Bohemia.
In the early season he lost the Spanish Superpachar in battle with Atlétik and failed even to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastián.
Paris SG's interest was also speculative.
This until the French League season he won two prizes and two draws, and on Sunday he shot St. Etienne 5:0.
Relatively the most pushing shoe club AS Monaco.
He's got a 1-1-2 balance in the league so far, and he broke up with Lille at least 1:1 this weekend.
News from the English boulevards today that Czechs might want in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Czech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not too likely.
Skybet wrote course 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible that you will change the uniform in the last few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything 100% about football.
Maybe during the day, there'll be an offer that won't be able to refuse.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know what kind of offer you can't refuse yet, it actually looks like.
First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's position as to whether or not the club's offer would be resolved.
Is it technically feasible to do such a transfer when you are now in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new facility?
I didn't think about it that way.
But there's a lot of players in this situation today, everybody's in a representative reunion somewhere, and I'm sure a lot of redundancies will be closed today.
So somehow it would be realistic.
How many clubs are on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing to leave?
The situation, when I didn't catch the new season in the first three games, is new to me after fifteen years of my career.
However, there's no reason to panic, pack and leave.
I want to continue to participate in this fight for the position of goalkeeper Chelsea, and he's on the coach who he chooses, what decisions he's gonna make over the next few weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, it is a sporting aspect for me, but I also look at it from a personal website, which of course belongs to the needs of the family.
Is it possible you could catch another club in England?
That's a question I never thought would be about.
But anything is possible in football.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.

Police in Carrata arrested a 20-year-old motorcycle chaser
The motorcycle stopped after the zone with a maximum allowed speed of 70 km/h ran 125 km/h and went to the bush to escape the police.
The patrolling traffic police tried to stop a blue motorcycle at the road in Carrat this morning when they noticed that they were leaving the gas station on Bathgate Road at 125 km/h.
According to the police, the driver didn't stop and go on the Burgess Road and then hit the bush, so the cops lost sight of him.
The motorbike and the person who corresponded to the driver's description were then seen in the house Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The Karath police accused a 20-year-old of disobeying the call for suspension and careless conduct.
It'll be September 23rd.
The bike was packed for three months.

Renewing the very American ideal that labour rights are at the same time human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect the organization in the union as a civil right.
"As unions work, middle-class jobs work," says Ellison, Democratic Senator for Minnesota, co-chaired by the Congress Committee.
That is why I am so proud to introduce a law that strengthens the position of employees along with the pattern of occasional rights.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and will stop anti-disciplinary forces
Adapt the Labour Relations Act to allow all workers who face discrimination if they want to engage in unions to judge in a civil court - and to condemn compensation or compensation - is a proper and necessary initiative.
It is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other law-makers put forward is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the union struggles in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember the land breathingly promoting democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to gather.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in forming a new Japan, included their language and acknowledged openly that “the right of workers to gather, negotiate and act together is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler is replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers would need to organise and promote in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly said: “The right to create associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and profession.
The arrangements which will restrict or seek to damage this right will be repealed. The measures leading to such a purpose are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, President of the International Commission for Human Rights, who proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the applicants and Roosevelt’s guarantee that “everyone has the right to create and enter trade unions in the protection of his interests.”
The Americans have accepted the fundamental premise that labour rights are human rights for generations.
When the country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create labour unions - and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is definitely necessary to go back to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and enforce themselves in free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a big teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the union has not reduced the power of the nation, but has spread it.
They have increased the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and production to an unsuspected level.
Those who attack the union forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and we shouldn't either.
The formal recognition of employment rights as human - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that raised America and made it a true promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could have closed all abortion clinics in Louisiana
On Sunday, the federal judge temporarily blocked the Lousian law, which, according to the lawyers, would likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
The Regulation, which was signed by Mr Bobby Jindal of Louisian governor in June, which is due to enter into force on 1 September, would require post-participating physicians to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The resolution of the judge means that doctors may temporarily continue their legal abortions and, in the meantime, they must obtain this authorisation.
“The applicant party will be able to legally carry out its activities and, in the meantime, obtains a permit,” states federal judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution concerning the law.
Activists for the rights of abortion of a resolution last in a series of similar measures welcomed and said that they would give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
“Today’s decision assures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from the deceptive law to prepare them for their health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Reproductive Rights Centre, who, on behalf of three out of five clinics, was sued by the prosecution to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision was made by doctors from two clinics that were not among the applicants and also asked for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states which have approved similar laws, while the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures a provision to be against the system.
The key parts of the Texas Act that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state would block a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the rights of women to abortion together with the Association of U.S. midwives and gynecologists and the American Medical Association argue that the need to have this authorisation requires doctors who are not medically required.
Poison opponents objected that measures aimed at protecting the health of women and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed because of the measures.
The Reproductive Rights Centre stated that in Louisiana only one abortion physician has permission.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop carrying out abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure for fear of his safety, said the group.
In response, the Louisiana authorities stated that they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while waiting for a request for rights to be dealt with.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment kill ovarian cancer more frequently
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of their deceased mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at greater risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analysed medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% of the five years after the diagnosis lived.
The research manager Susan Jordan of QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute reported that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
MALA STUDY: New drugs can slow lung and ovaries cancer
Female researchers followed over seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival were influenced by the age of women at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest rate of survival occurred in elderly women whose cancer was diagnosed at an advanced stage.
In women in rural and remote areas of the state, there was about 20 percent more likelihood that they would die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that the factors could be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
“The disease can best cure gynecooncologists, who usually reside in larger cities,” she said.
Despite the improvement of medical services at a distance to overcome the distance barrier, the doctor suggested that it would help to strengthen the transport service that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who heal far from their families and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of ovaries cancer women is no matter where the geographical location is low, stressing the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, young mother Elisha Neave of Gold Coast was diagnosed with aggressive ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret reducing the number of owners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary decline of owners of houses under 35 could lead to the arrival of a "main age group of gardeners" of up to ten million pounds a year.
According to the report, people who rent their homes spend on average 55% of the amount they spend on people living in their homes.
As other factors that threaten the sector, which is making an estimated £5 billion per year, reports an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanised areas where there are no gardens, a likeness in front gardening used as a parking area and a shrinking size of gardens.
In the area of Great London, where the share of owned houses decreased from 61% to 43%, the lowest expenditure on gardening products in Britain per household is the lowest.
HTA and the Royal Horticulture Society have stated that living in a sublet or a lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief gardener for RHS, said: “The tenants have a very popular plant growing in pots - when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "Golden Age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
Also this year, he predicted higher sales due to better weather that came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin, at the convention of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all of them of Hitlerjugend, saved with nuclear weapons, and basically gave everyone the impression that their views were not taken from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I feel that the current regime in Russia has many features of the fascist state.
Great nations have one thing in common, and that's because they can control both advanced nationalism and the fact that the minority complex can transform them into imperialistic tastes.
It's probably different in the east than it is in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of war over Europe was long gone, in the east they thought they had been overlooked for a long time and needed to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazi's power was captured, and then a nationalism explosion was followed by an unsimilar situation in Russia.
And then this completely identical cult of a strong leader, the beating up of journalists, the destruction of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that is certainly quite similar.
Vladimír Putin and certainly much of the Russians have missed the time when Russia ruled half the world and the second part was shaking before them.
I guess Western politicians did it themselves, maybe little Vladimír was patting on their shoulders, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted him, and maybe they started underestimating him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He made up his own house, pretended he didn't really want to go anywhere, and he was grinding knives at home.
Now he's decided to reinstate the lost position.
He starts slowly, he has time.
The leader's probably for life, so where he'll be in a hurry.
He trampled the Caucasians, now he's trampling the Ukrainians, then the Dwarfs of the Balls are on their way.
The Russian bear's been snuffing in her fur long enough.
I'm sure it'll be noticed by China, who's getting a little too high, and I'm sure he's looking at the far way out.
And the Germans of Vladimír are pretty upset about how well they're doing, and I put that on their ass at 45.
How about we do one new Novorosi in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the base, and there's plenty of ours, and as they're being oppressed by the Dača too, they're trying to tear down the leckter from them.
After all, our veterans have so far remembered how they were supposed to be in Czechoslovakia.
The Prime Minister of Gospodin Sobotka, who is so soft, can be peeled like onions and will eat the entire EU.
That would be so much fun for them to jump on the great Russia.
They need to be reminded of their place.
And we're going to use our reindeer who lives in their territory as explosives.
The Russians are all over the place, and when they say they're being oppressed, they're just oppressed, and we're not gonna let that happen, we're gonna protect them.
And again, the Russians will rule, for what else is born for.
Europe is only as good as an ingredient that a proud Ivan can dance on.
Turkey has called in an American diplomat for an espionage report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called upon the highest-ranking U.S. diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British espionage activity in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the American Charge d'affaires and Turkish civil servants discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and Internet magazine The Intercept reported that according to the documents provided by the former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was the priority objective of American and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish media, the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, put the importance of the report and stated that all major states were watching each other.
The older report, according to which the German intelligence services focused on Ankara, caused a more bitter response to the Turkish government.

Police Director in Magaluf charged with corruption
The complainants presented evidence of extortion by police and city hall officials in the Calvia self-government area to the Mallorian State Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Police director in Calvia on Mallorca Island was arrested after charges made by entrepreneurs and bar owners in an infamous party district in Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was charged with corruption by several businessmen from Punt Ballen, a street in which most bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's website, on Friday, complainants submitted evidence of extortion by police officers and public officials of the City Hall in Calvia's self-administrative area on the basis of the Mallorca Diario.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police because of their connection to corruption charges, and together with Navarre, the judge will question them.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted unsatisfying owners of night enterprises, according to which the advantage of public agents has a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving," said one of the entrepreneurs in court.
Don't mess with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made it to the main pages of magazines around the world after the video of 18-year-old British tourists appeared on YouTube, which provided oral sex to 24 men during the tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to oversee drunks and outlaws in the ranks of the Magaful holiday parties by reducing the number of infamous alcoholic tours by bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the oral sex events occurred, was forced to close and together with the tour operators after Carnage bars to pay a fine of 55 000 euros (73 000 dollars).
The Magaluf tourist resort, which is especially popular with the British, was also a witness to many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the fashion wave known as "Balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
First spring day marked with rain and storms that had an impact on flights at Adelaide Airport
JARO brought an ice surprise to the south of South Australia, coming with a strong rain and a violent wind that seriously hit Adelaide airport.
Another 5 mm of precipitation in the city should be up to nine hours in the evening and another 6.6 mm starting during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced together with a few short Showers associated with storm and wind storms, which began eight o'clock in the evening and brought almost 4 mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After a few early spring doses came in last winter, the city's temperature dropped again on Monday at only 15.8 °C.
Storm weather is thought to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land for a while after 19:30, but at a short distance it was hit by a change in the speed or direction of the wind and was forced to delay landing.
At that time, the winds at Adelaide Airport reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop from second landing and finally landed at about 8:40.
The delays in the aircraft subsequently caused delays in further flights, including the Dubai flight of Emirates and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to forecast, they reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday temperature in Adelaide and one or two exaggerations may occur.
After the war in Gaza, Israel’s children return to school
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near Gaza returned to school on Monday after spending summer in anti-bomb shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas on their homes attacked missiles and minetes. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory recovers from fighting.
The start of the school brought to communities in the south of Israel marked attacks a feeling of joy and excitement, but the signs of fighting are still visible.
In Ashdodod, a city in the south of the country, employees of a kindergarten hit by a rocket, removed the remains from the wall after shards and slowly expected the return of children.
"We're a little worried, but we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bartová, a student of Kibucu Saad and an English teacher at a local school.
Many of the children in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, told her that "it's a little strange" to go back to school.
"We've had a few hard times and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer its support to the population.
Until the ceasefire last week ended the war, thousands of inhabitants of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or their homes and went to a safer area from Gaza to escape missiles and minetes.
Many of the population of Nachal Oz, a village close to the Gaza border, in which the Palestinian Minomet missile killed a four-year-old boy, with a return weight.
The Minister of Education said about 12 families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in foster schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was strongly hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently and added: “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timeless peace last Tuesday.
While the ceasefire led to the immediate end of the fight, it did not solve the key problems of Hamas' request to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and re-open Gaza airports and ports.
Israel demands disarming Hamas and returning the bodies of two soldiers who died in war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to start later this month in Egypt.
More than 2 100 Palestinians died in war, according to Palestinians, of which three quarters were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel doubts these figures and estimates that at least half of the killed were radical, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died on the Israeli side.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired in the fight against Israeli cities mainly in the south of the country of 4 591 missiles and missiles from the minetes.
The Israeli army has taken over 5,000 air raids and more attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and estimated 250,000 people hid in hundreds of UN schools that turned into temporary shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people who are still in hiding, school officials have postponed the beginning of the school year due to their ongoing struggles last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open up so that we can complete our education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy from school in Gaza's largest city.
I'm standing behind you.
And Laphata's a pain in the temperature
The Czech football team met before noon in Prague before the Wednesday preparation match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the qualification of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Of the 32-member caste, the Spartan attacker David Lafata is having problems with the temperature.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, and it was more players, and David might still have some problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," said Coach Pavel Vrba.
"If it's two or three days, or it'll be fit tomorrow, we'll see it according to his medical condition, which our doctor will decide on," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some kind of pain, but it's not that they can't train or participate in a game on Wednesday with the USA," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday night Vrba called in the final player of the Spartan backupr Lukáš Vácha.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, and other middle - schoolers also took into account.
I decided that Luke was a prospective player, 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand by it," said Vrba to Vácho.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latata.
It is not ruled out that, in the case of health problems, nominations could still change.
On the weekend with great performance, for example, the Liberec Josef Šural, who gave the hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have recently shown form.
Let's see where David Lafata is.
In case he cannot be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot predominate any of the players who were interested in the Czech league," said Vrba.
This afternoon, the training representation in Strahov awaits, on Tuesday then the classic pre-game training before the duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and after which the autograph will follow.
The game against Americans is played on Wednesday from 8:15 and the national team in it will seek the premiere victory at Vrbo.
In the previous three preparatory games he played two draws and once lost.
The qualification match with the Netherlands is then on the programme 9 September from 20:45.
Pesce goes to Italy in the Netherlands
Vrba is glad that she has more time to practice than before.
It's an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice with them certain things that we didn't have so much time for before.
Now we will be able to focus only on getting the best ready for the Netherlands," Vrba praised.
The Dutch will present themselves before the match in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will personally watch the former temporary representation coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information that's in the game.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a game and we're gonna have a shot and we're gonna talk about it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there," said Vrba to the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to very monitored statistics, housing prices in the winter period have increased most over the last seven years.
According to the housing price index in the Australian capital of the Republic of Korea Data CoreLogic, living prices increased by 1.1 % in August, the Agency stated on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase rose to 10.9%, more than doubled for one year until August 2013, but the profit was not even distributed in the country.
Polish Research Manager Data Tim Lawless stated that Sydney and Melbourne are in charge of the market.
RP Data shows that the housing prices in Sydney increased by 16.1% last year, while the prices in Melbourne increased by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an average price increase of between five and six percent.
On the other hand, Canberra was placed on the scale, which damaged the state-enforced reduction in expenditure and where prices increased by only 1.4 % during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring started, the number of real estates will increase in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"In view of the continuing high level of auction sales, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, it is likely that housing will increase over the next three months," he said.
My father never hired me.
He never told me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, the Middlelands.
With his father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked at the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry's trying comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and which is part of Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After the death of his mother, Henry went through a "constant" therapy, and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice: “Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, were adults - were with him going to the bar and discussing things like the shape of a glass of beer or the beauty of a hit in a cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life he was a serious guy in a corner reading the paper.
Recently Henry visited the Dudley foundry, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked into what life had to be for him.
There's a little more light out there today, but it's still a dark, sweaty, cloudy labyrinth where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
My dad always got in the tub, and he was just lying there, and then it was like he was slowly starting to sing for himself because he was washing up the foundry.
When I walked by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to feed on his family, and I started to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry had a childhood without a parent's love.
Dad didn't hire anyone, he didn't say "I love you."
When Mom was sick and dying, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who has Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
French, married to 25, are still good friends.
Dawn's a good girl.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot overweight, and the symptoms of diabetes began to manifest, the doctor said to me: “You must make a radical change.”
So I started going to a big fitness center, and I also had to hold a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat carrots alone.
The change in the direction of taking Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After he received recognition from the critic for his Othella, he dived into the theatre.
Followed by Comedy full of mistakes and the fences of August Wilson.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedys that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at a factory.
DJ noticed him on the stage setting up someone, writing about him in the New Faces talent competition.
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black imitator/commission on television."
He was learning at the march.
Besides the fact that I had to be noticed by the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to make working jokes, be a star and perform on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the stage production rights The Black and White Minstrel Show, the entertainment program in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry finally performed with his comedy for five years.
My family was no longer happy about it.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "the main product of British television for years and years" was "the grotesque parody of blacks".
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters that also mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began to broadcast in 1984 and in the 1990s he was known, among other things, as chef of Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
For the next decade, he took commercials, documents, television shows, and roles in movies, but after the broadcast of his LennyHenry.tv to the BBC in 2008, he said: "So what do you do now, Len, it looks like you got stuck in one place or you're a little out of the way."
Next up was the documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really teach him at school, and I thought it was something for a white middle class.
So I was worried about it.
Everyone on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented 20 lines from Othell's closing statement for the document, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me courage.
“It’s about that. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, learn something about it.
So the trial was hard, and before that, I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were in trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in Comedy full of mistakes.
I was suddenly at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical defect, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for entertaining the audience.
“The sound in my head said to me: “You must now entertain them ten minutes before repairing the computer.”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve this for me.
"You play, so stay in the role."
Henry at the fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learn about the fence text was a challenge.
Panic is quite good, adding determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like God's sign that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, that's what she says in her voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm happy to be in the rehearsal.
Henry still remains a comedian's brain - our conversation has been interrupted by humorous performances, when he enters and comes out of the role of an imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I guess.
If you're always looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't like it anymore.
I asked if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director, who helps to give an outline of the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine on non-existent employees
Kenya began with the biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove from the government's payroll the non-existent employees.
According to the government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will cease to be paid.
The government considers that thousands of people get paid even after they left the state service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
This year's audit showed that the state loses a million dollars a month at least ($700 000) on the salaries of non-existent employees and further abuse of official authority.
The government is suspected that salaries are still placed on bank accounts even after the death of the employee, or after the employee has left the government administration, the BBC reporter from Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All civil servants must arrive at the identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, shall be indicated in the government declaration.
He also says that anyone who does not show up without enough apology will be excluded from the payroll.
"By providing real public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economic development and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested for a "split" against the government
The local media states that in Turkey 33 police officers were arrested due to suspicion of a “discipline against the government”.
The police office hasn't commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 senior officials in custody.
Some of them were involved in a December corruption investigation that focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for the alleged organization of a criminal gang and telephone wiretap.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at that time the Prime Minister) identified their actions as part of the Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened up again on Monday (1 September) after summer break.
This day is traditionally important for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the Prime Minister Arseni Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists that not all schools have reopened, but that the determined country is to defend for the next generation:
Not at all schools was the traditional ceremony of September 1.
No, there's peace in all of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pasteukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavjansk, attended by Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the kids wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and teachers to give flowers.
In Rona Fairhead, maybe the BBC found the head of the hard times.
It brings with it the clouds of fame from the world of banking, the media management and internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience from the front lines herself.
She started her career in Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when Pearson's parent company took over her younger colleague.
It's said that her retirement was close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former CEO of BP when Cameron needed a private expert in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the government.
Her husband is a former city council member.
In May, I described the Director's work as a chalice with poison.
Not only is the BBC an extensive and complex entity in the center of public life, but there is also an inner paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns two directions: inside the top layer of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also out to the public in times of restlessness when things don't work.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires a thorough reform.
But the director who risked coming to a company complex as a Chinese dynasty will decompose it and thus lose his job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't that hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrinking - her power, her finances - and how her status is revised.
As competition extends and new technologies question old certainty, they bring with them the immediate negotiations on concession fees for the BBC.
With a modest amount of 145.50 pounds a year, the British public buys a share of something that is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production is 96% of households and it costs only 40p a day.
In addition, the BBC’s popularity is obviously rising to 53% of its supporters compared to 31% of those of 10 years ago.
The use of BBC services has changed: Today I see news headlines on my mobile phone and on the shows I missed, I can look at the i Player.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims that the offensive tweet did not approve
Tweet from the official Twister account of the Texas Governor Rick Perry, which was published on Sunday, contained an offensive picture of a democratic state attorney who initiated Perry's criminal charges for abuse of authority.
Tweet was deleted later and another one was released on Perry's account, which was disassembled from the previous one.
A tweet left my account that wasn't authorized.
"I disagree with tweet and downloaded it," he said in his next post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is unclear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet was published by the unflattering, humorous picture of the district attorney Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted in April 2013 for being drunk.
When she refused to resign, Perry rejected the payment of funds for her office, which Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 elections, brought this month before the grand jury in Austin.
It said in the tweet: “I don’t always drive with three times the level of alcohol in my blood than the limit allowed... but when I do, I will sue Governor Perry for calling me to account.”
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, was responsible for him, who was appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent, and he called it a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has requested a court-martial judge to reject the charges because the use of the law to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas's history is unintentionary.
Perry stopped paying 7.5 million dollars from the State Fund for Public Interest Protection, based in Travis County, and prosecuted corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection brought about a formal complaint by a left-handed group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it gets famous.
After ending up in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign in fifth place in the committee of his party, Perry replied to speculation about how he might have ended, tweeted with his own photo, running near the lake, and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is back to normal.
One of the most prominent developers in London warned that the housing market in southern England "returned" to the normal level of activity.
Living in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices and increased concerns about the credit bubble caused in June Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the development company for the demanding clients of Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned from its peak in 2013 to a normal level of transactions.”
The London housing market was successful during the fall because buyers from abroad flooded into the capital.
According to the data of the cadastral office only last year, prices in the city jumped by 18.5%, thus far overrun the average of 6.7% in England and the whole of Wales.
Average selling prices for private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about five last year and reached 423 000 pounds at the end of April.
However, thanks to the strengthening libra in recent months, foreign buyers of London's real estate have not been so attractive - some of them have also threatened to introduce new real estate taxes and talk about possible 'seat tax' with which politicians have come before the parliamentary elections next May.
London's real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced more stringent lending rules, will also slow down the market growth rate for both real estate and prices during the second half of the year.
The new Bank of England data on Monday showed a fall in the amount of approved mortgages per month of July, indicating that the housing market is calming down.
The Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has decreased on the basis of the fact that home prices have already begun to decline, with its 2015 growth forecast for London real estate prices to 3%.
According to WA Ellis, the volume of transactions in London’s most expensive neighbourhoods, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, decreased by a quarter every year.
Nevertheless, the demand for housing in the capital for Berkeley was a blessing because it increased cash for forward sales to more than 2,2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-looking housing in a good locality remained the same, thus maintaining forward sales. ”
In June, the company announced that from the beginning of the year to the end of April it sold 3,742 properties, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
The annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to £ 380 million, yields by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, before Pidgley’s annual meeting, he said that it is foreseen that the annual revenues of Berkeley would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be £450 million.
Berkeley's shares stopped at the London Stock Exchange at £23.96 this afternoon.
Hacker posted pictures of naked Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
The photos of Oscar's owner Jennifer Lawrence leaked on the Internet because of a hacker who claimed to have a "list" of pictures of other hundreds of starting actresses.
The movie spokesperson "Hunger Games" confirmed that the Lawrence photos were real and the hacker criticized for "a clear violation of privacy."
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who steals pictures of Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker photos that were originally published on the 4chan Picture Sharing Server, allegedly obtained thanks to the gap in the Applu iCloud internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the film "Scott Piggrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
“I hope that those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I had taken years ago in a private home are happy with each other,” wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known for her TV series, is called "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied that the photos were real. On Twitter, she said: "These are my alleged naked pictures of me, people."
It's better to cut it off.
Buzzfeed announced Sunday night that the spokesperson of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the alleged photographs were true.
An extraordinary demonstration from Howard Jacobson's praised new novel on love and the letter "J"
Dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually spread out as a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Just from time to time, a woman told him he was too serious, too complicated, too sharp, isolated, and maybe a little insidious.
And then she shaked his hand.
He just admitted it.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was a starting love affair, which more than usual promised to relieve him from lonely life boredom and perhaps provide some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild hair and a floating heart from a village on the north island, which was even more remote and hostile than Port Reuben.
To the south came an older companion who Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited property in a wet but wonderful valley called, conveniently, the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes leaked, there were dead spiders in the vans, the slimy ones signed their asses on the windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was sprawled and the weeds looked like huge bells of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, scary and charming at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations at the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting in the fold chairs in the long grass and holding hands, enjoying the unexpected warm spring afternoon, and they were uninhabited by a public station that provided comforting music and comforting news when looking at her tanned cross-legged feet reminded him of the old song of a long forgotten black comedian who was happy to listen to his father with his roller blinds.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They weren't forbidden - there was nothing really forbidden - they just weren't playing.
They helped them get into the desuetuda, just like the word desuetudo.
People's taste has proven what regulations and positions would never be able to do outside the law, and, like people who choose books, the memoirs in which the poor man becomes rich, cooks, and love novels, are chosen by ballads.
Kavern took his day off and started playing imaginary piano and a rude, comical voice, sang the Serenada to Aillin's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
“It was a favorite song from the jazz pianist Fats Waller,” he said and automatically added two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he tried to suppress the letter j before he got out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
Father told him that he played the game with his father.
When you put two fingers in front of your mouth by saying it, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't funny at the time.
He just knew it was to be expected of him, that was all.
He must have explained what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard one.
Even if jazz wasn't directly built outside the law, they weren't playing.
Improvisation came out of fashion.
There's only room in life for one thing.
When she started playing melody, people wanted to know exactly where she was going to end up.
Same in humor.
His unpredictability has turned people's nerves.
And jazz was a humor expressed in songs.
Although he hadn't heard from Sammy Davis Junior in ten years, Kevern knew a jazz from his father's half-secret CD collection.
At least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember the time when popular singers weren't black.
Also without the law or the pressure.
The slow society is one in which each part of it is grateful - with the gratitude of those who have been saved by a happy chance - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Karib origin with temperament and constitution were suitable for entertainment and athletics, and so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature given to electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family will be without a functional phone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, Greeks, who stayed, wash the dishes.
Those from the Gulf States and Levant, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country, while what happened was what was going on, if they were afraid that they had put them in the fire, they were actually afraid that the fire would be going to spend the next time - they opened up a restaurant where they were selling water pipes and smoking water pipes, they wouldn't notice themselves, and the inaction was slowly eating them.
Everyone according to his talents.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how the dirty words Kavern had just sung could create music.
Music was a expression of love.
"In fact, they are not rude," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people with too many legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he liked this song.
He talked too, but the neglected garden provided an illusion of safety.
Nothing could escape from behind soundproofed leaves.
Ailinn still didn't get it.
Why would your father like that?
He meant to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny to him," he said in the end.
She shaked her head in disbelief and overshadowed Kevern's view.
In the whole wide world, nothing could be seen but the confusion of her raven hair.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you think," she said questionably.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing to me.
She seemed really upset.
My legs are too big?
He looked again.
Not exactly walking.
Maybe a little ankle...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have called her "I love you," but it was too soon.
"I'm attracted to your fat ankles right now," he tried.
I'm kind of creepy.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic needed to tame the cruelty she was waiting for in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel intentionally.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons got lost and got off the couch, dropped the radio, and spilled the drinking wine.
Wine-free, so it wasn't worth the drinking.
She seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a storm in her excitement.
"I'm sickly attracted to you as a jerk," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
She felt sorry for him, both for her unkind words, and for the fear she had in her eyes the moment she stood up against him.
She thought she'd get hit?
She didn't talk to him about life on a cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he never doubted that the basics were the same here.
They were surrounded by the same wide and icy ocean.
The same deranged men, after WHAT STALO, even more relentless and repulsive than their ancestors, smugglers and spoilers, bewildered from the pub to the pub, prepared to lay hands on any woman who would dare to refuse them or laugh at them.
Stupid?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First anointing her - anointing became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antidote of the young ballads about the love that the radio christed - first they anointed her, then one murder her.
In Kevern's view, overcultivation, because of its own abuse was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons unverbably suggested he leave.
He got off the couch like an old man.
She felt angry herself, but the weight of his sorrow surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She watched her leave - as if she were watching him from the window on the floor - the man she caught up with, what he caused himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was closed because of him and for all men in general, regardless of the fact that a few beat her up.
A man turned away from her, his shoulders hanged, shamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel that she knew this look well, even though she couldn't remember a single moment until today that she'd ever seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her legs.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 23-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statutory monitoring system Public moods, prepared a short article on the continuation of light and medium-sized violent acts in the areas of the country where it was mitigated or stopped, most expected that enough money and energy would be spent to remove it.
“A lot has been done, and there is still a lot to be done,” she wrote, “to calm down the innate aggression of the people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the drenched, hard - accessible places of the earth, where despite the peaks of the church towers rising above the hedges of human kindness, man had historically appeared."
But some things are irreplaceable.
The higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents are sighing over sentimental ballads, devouring unfortunate stories and saying that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that old brutality is as stubborn as in urban agglomerations, but also evidence shows that there is new and offensive intolerance at home, in the workplace, in the roads and even in the sports fields.
"You have a tendency to be too Maye-style," said her superior.
I would suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head down.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I feel like I don't have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has reenacted her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"I'm not asking therefore," Rabinowitz said, "that I should have something against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
We don't have any prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unscrupulous companies.
But a certain type of hypersensitivity that is totally acceptable and commendable in itself can sometimes distort judgment as you did.
Clearly, you yourself are presumptuous to the Church - things you call "crutinous" and "brutal" might also be interpreted as a expression of natural force and energy.
Continue to think about what it was like if it happened, as if it had happened yesterday, he was preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the lightboard, the recommendations of Ofnow were rosy, broadcast into the world for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile for your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silent, singing word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
“I completely understand your reservations,” said Esme Nussbaum, when she was confident that her superior had finished, “and I am no longer saying that the wound had not healed as we say it had healed.
My main concern is that, if we are not aware of this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what had happened if it had happened.
This time, however, we will not ventilate with anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz tied the fingertips.
That was meant to mean infinite patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “when the steps that you may have taken and may not have made your grandparents, you describe them as mistakes.
You are too far away from talking about venting your "freak" and "belief" on the "others."
I should not remind anyone in your place that, in understanding the past and in protecting the present, we do not speak of "us" and "them."
There were no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is it was chaotic times.
“In the course of which, if we are honest with one another, ” Esme took the courage, “we are no one without fault.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not what happened, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to say - we agree on this.
And just as there is no fault to blame anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the remedy was appropriate and possible.
But what is the past for other than learning from it?
The past exists so we can forget about it.
If there's anything I can add to that--
Luther Rabinowitz cut off the fingertips.
"I will take your message into account," he said and released it.
The day when she went to work as usual, a biker hit her, who ran down on the sidewalk in a way that passers described as “brute and angry.”
Coincidence happens.
The Kingdom of Lesotho's army claims that no puck is planning - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Kingdom of Lesotho denied to organize a coup for the purpose of overthrowing the government, claiming that they had acted against the police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says that the army surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital of the Masseru.
After he declared that they threatened to kill him, the Prime Minister and his family went to the neighbouring Republic of South Africa.
Major Ntlele Ntoi's military spokesperson said that it wasn't really a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" which the police were trying to arm.
“This morning, the command of the defense forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after received several information service reports, that there are several groups in the ranks of the police that plan to arm some of the radical political fanatics who were about to make a comeback in the country,” he said to the Voice of America.
The spokesperson of South Africa's government Clayson Monoela said that military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
“Although no one declared himself to have taken up government power by force, the actions of the Lesothian defense forces seem to bear the sign of a coup,” he said.
Military representatives of the Kingdom of Lesotho said that the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and was quiet in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane stated that in his opinion the target of the attack was his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended Parliament's session due to internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He declared that despite the opposite claim, he did not undermine his actions to the government.
Eurozone production is at a minimum of 13 months
Production growth has slowed to a minimum of 13 months, according to a carefully monitored survey in the euro area in August.
The final index of euro area purchasing managers (PMI) from June 51.8 fell to 50.7.
A number higher than 50 means expansion.
New orders and factories have damaged the growing tensions between the EU and Russia because of Ukraine.
The figures are from the European Central Bank (ECB) Thursday's meeting.
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the euro area as well as the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating to 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have suggested this week that he is considering the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to that of the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the brake effect that has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer is becoming more visible,” said Rob Dobson, the main economist of Markit.
The German manufacturing PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 51.4 months.
In the second largest economy zone, France, PMI fell on 46.9.
The concern is about France, Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force for growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands have disappeared are also not very comforting," Dobson said.
The slowdown of industry is likely to add oil to the fire to analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the Chief Economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the production overview of shopping managers for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: Eurozone producers are living a very difficult life at present because the increasing geopolitical tension - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds even more uncertainty to the increasingly demanding conditions in many countries.
These increasing uncertainty of trade has proven to have affected - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially the costly ones.
He stated that, as “more likely,” it would appear that the ECB would eventually have to do some form of quantitative easing, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten years of hell from Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of the occupied school children still suffer
Ten years ago, a thousand people were arrested in a school in Beslan, southern Russia as hostages
During the suffering that lasted three days and shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We went back to Beslan to look up some of the victims who escaped death during the school at the atrocities
Exactly 10 years after the frightening occupation of Beslan, in which 334 people, including 186 children, died, warned the survivors of the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, they captured and murdered fanatical terrorist children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to tragedy has united the East and the West, leading to negotiations and the future in this catastrophic disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan, southern Russia, to seek out some of the victims who had escaped death during the school's atrocities.
We've found amazing young people who have resisted unhappiness, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will live on.
What's their biggest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is over.
A girl trying to climb back into a ruined school gym
She was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov as she only tries to climb back into the bombed-out school gym after the bomb exploded in her underwear.
A confused Aida was desperately looking for her mother Larissa, who is now forty.
There were concerns that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
“A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were blood-stained.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several surgeries, she thought that she had already fully recovered, but yesterday she said: “Through three months ago, the pain had returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
I've got pieces of shard left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people the way her doctors helped her.
“This tragedy has changed my life, but it has certainly not destroyed it,” she determined.
“It just happened to me, and it can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and future classmate in the Gapev class killed there.
As a kid, we used to play together and imagine going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about family later.
She says she didn't forget the capture, but memories go a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
When I look on the Internet at my picture of me climbing through the school window, I think a lot of people will see her for the first time, understand the disaster, and stop her from repeating.
A boy who escaped by the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia the children of the school began at seven years) and survived the three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamar.
At that time, he said: “Mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand. ”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid she was dead, he was running, and he saw a crying mess, grabbed the baby by the hand, and ran off with a shower bullet.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother was dead. ”
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara swirled into freedom and was lying in a hospital with a broken leg, and on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After meeting again, she said: “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (in accordance with the lost newspaper News of the World), where then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that memories are getting pale.
I remember then I threw all my guns at the play.
But today I can play computer games in which they shoot, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the yard with who didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed at the gym.
For a trip to London, I remember well, especially how I could choose anything I wanted at the toy shop, and how I went with the convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where because of the war he suffers just as he and his friends have suffered.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
“I am so sorry for anyone who must go through such a horror,” says Damir, who took part in a voluntary activity at the monastery last week.
I want to be very helpful.
One day I want to work with the police, and I hope they'll take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, there were no children who would scream and run around, and that silence took months.
He's living in memory of his journey to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people across the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her personally that even if it was ten years ago, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's taste for borsch, and so they called all Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot at them with a water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it's only been a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better in ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think it's been, and a lot of children will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think war for a lot of people is just something in the news that they listen to when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice, quiet kid, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know she doesn't like to remember that, but she's very close to six classmates, and she goes to the gym from time to time, and they light candles there.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember when he used to lie on a couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes he was lying there for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember he threw away all his guns or other weapons to play.
I can hardly believe I was sure he was dead for a few hours and I'd never see him again.
When I got back after the explosion, I looked around, and I saw hell, and there were pieces of human bodies lying there.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember screaming “Damire, run, run!” but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives go further than others.
Grigorij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Comfort: The survivors from Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, to the right Grigorij today
When he was running for his life after the Chechnya terrorist shot his classmates, there was fear in his bloodthirsty face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and hurried to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists invaded the yard, so my little boy stayed there alone for three days," she said.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
The only thing that survived was my Grigori.
As the date approaches, it's still harder to think about and talk about it.
It won't be a day for us to remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Photo Grigori (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was eternally as a statue (right)
I remember when Grigori was so excited about school that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
That he was alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of a crying Grigori in San Marina.
Grigorij doesn't like to see the picture, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I get it, but I also think that this picture makes people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigorij says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still under investigation, but no one will ever know the truth.
Now they're investigating the boeing accident in Ukraine.
Do we ever get to know what the cause was?
There's something very wrong with this world.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
It takes decades for us to forget.
It had an effect on my health, I can still feel it.
I had three or four years of nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and my classmates who were killed.
That's why, when it comes September 1, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and began to study medicine at the University of Vladimirawaz.
I want to be a cardiosurgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was held at the foot of a murdering terrorist
Miracle: Gregorij Farniyev was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full force, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a terrorist-killing bomb.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us as if yesterday," said Gregorij, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but he could not because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind me.
Now I'm older, and they say that children with bad experiences can cope better - I have to say, that's not true.
“In 2006, I went to a psychologist and felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'll never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I sit in that well-known picture.
Survival: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with his photos taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me to go to school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I need to be careful about my knee that I hurt, but I'm already walking normally.
But I still couldn't get into health and study at the FBS Academy in St Petersburg as I wanted to.
I sent them my medical records, including my medical reports, and they told me it wasn't possible.
My other hobby is animals, so I got into a vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from "cats to cows".
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something that kids should know about and not even something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain will always be here.
He's inside and he's getting worse with his anniversary coming up.
I'll take part in the memorial ceremony.
I know Grigori won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God he gave it back to me, there are traces everywhere in Beslan.
It stays with us.
Gregorij is an adult today, but he's carrying on with the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say he's over 50% of the horror, but you can't get over it completely and you can't forget.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack, they killed a lot of our friends and neighbors, and it only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I liked and were close to.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could have given me, but I'm in pain of losing the killed.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who had not remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in different places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why kill each other?
The war is coming to our country now, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one of our friends, so how did we get to fight now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could take all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who has taken to safety a special command
Saved: Alyona Tskaevu brings to a secure Russian special command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the tragedy at all
The world in 2004 caught its breath when little Alyon carried a Russian police officer in his arms from the Beslanic captivity.
Terrorists let her go, however, left her 30 - year - old mother, sister Kristina, and brother Makhar in captivity at the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at that time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and had a little girl named Kristina after her dead daughter.
The neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, does not remember the attack at all and grew up with a bright and happy girl.
A close friend stated that “they are a great happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great children. ”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary reminds.
You can understand why.

4 tips to get underwater photos and videos
If you are interested in shooting or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment available.
Cheapest options are compact such as Nikon Coolpixel AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these pictures at a family party of several cameras, they all cost less than 350 dollars.
It does not matter what equipment you use, but several rules apply to achieve the best results.
Check your gear.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Then set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will receive.
Some cameras and video cameras have a staged or filming mode that optimizes the exposure to the dark environment under water.
And before you do, figure out how deep you can dive in with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only up to 5 feet, another up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in both normal and waterproof versions.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't work out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you with the photo composition, but outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have LCD, the underwater will be badly seen and the image composition will be unpredictable.
So always take more shots.
If the camera has a cracketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different dispersion of the exposure, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper immersion of light, it falls significantly.
If possible, stay close to the pool, lake or sea while taking pictures.
This will also allow you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you sink, the less colors you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That's great advice if you're taking pictures on land, but underwater is even more important because of a more lucid light.
It is particularly important if you are filming with outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a firm and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the photo frames, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality could change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As an anaesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieve the sick from pain caused by sickness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that maimed him.
Lawson understood that while physicians concentrate on diagnosis and illness, treated patients in the vast majority are interested in something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who started suffering.
“I do not feel in my skin,” he wrote in May that year.
I felt powerless.
He was dealing with flu symptoms, and he found out he was impatient, and Juliet's wife includes regret.
He noted: “I want everything to be done sooner than later. ”
When Juliet left for a week on her business trip, Lawson was unusually and unexplained.
Something wasn't right.
His friend did a chest X-ray.
One two weeks before, he used to ski in the French Alps.
The X-ray results came back.
He had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects an iris or a pulmonary pathway.
Most cancers find it hard to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer smoked.
The mesoteliom is different.
Almost in all cases, the cause of exposure to asbestos is a building fibre material that was previously referred to as "bewildering", but it is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the ban on the use of asbestos in industry entered into force.
Even at the time when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as isolation treasurers, builders, carpenters and workers in the shipyards.
Toxin used in the industry in another era is hard to see today as a reason for concern.
Such selfishness is not in place.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemics are about to peak in Britain today.
The number of deaths on mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year are twice as many as the number of car accident victims.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in the UK
The reason why we only feel its effects now, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all species of asbestos were finally banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes decades to develop the mesothelim.
Mesothelioma is not only affected by veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases still is, present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in schools where we study, and in the shops where we shop.
Therefore, the mesoteliom does not respect the social layer, wealth, profession, or age.
Privileges from London business houses to public schools do not constitute shelter.
Parliament too is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the storage of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put in isolation.
He was trying to find out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
“It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years in practice,” he wrote.
All students, sisters, doctors and doormen used corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he was able to partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital and who then showed up in the past five years with mesothelioma," he noted in his letter in 2010, "I'm the only one still alive."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17th this year, he was 55.
It is not common to survive with this diagnosis for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now, then, we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will get sick with the same disease?
According to a British mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Pet's best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain takes place, about 90 000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
When looking at the writings from the archives of the courts, which the disabled often turn to and require compensation, it shows how much the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, this June admitted to Marks & Spencer that she had issued asbestos Janice Allen from negligence.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 until1987, when she supervised two stores in the clothing section - one of the places was a flagship company, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18, when she started working for M&S.
He's got two kids today who's over 20.
“Before this happened, ” she says, “I’ve never heard of mesothelioma before, I hardly knew anything about asbestos.
I never had a dream that he might have something to do with me.
There are not many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given thanks to his fibrillary structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in the construction industry.
Most often today in buildings is possible to find chrysotil, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even brake linings.
It is not as deadly as any other form of asbestos, the EU and WHO nevertheless consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
The more dangerous is brown asbestos (amposit) and blue asbestos (crokydolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say that "there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of unusually high mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom]."
Marsk & Spencer's staff was exposed to asbestos in a flagship store in Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pet's work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His studies suggest that “a significant part of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is due to the "ordinary use and weathering" of buildings.
It seems like no one can be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the center of the government may not know that asbestos may be exposed.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that the service lifts and pipes behind the rooms of the parliamentary committee are contaminated by asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be broken by something as harmless as the “powerful flow of air”.
Ministers are often accused of taking care only of their own interests, but in this case the opposite can be true.
Although Parliament's Directorate of Services insisted on getting a "constant medical certificate" to Westminster Palace, it is now expected that one million pounds and several years of work will be needed to thoroughly examine Parliament, modernise electricity and eliminate asbestos, and that Members will sit more on green benches in Westminster in the areas of Queen Elizabeth II's Conference Centre after the 2015 elections.
Goddard’s report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations. ”
It is impossible to say whether this disconsistency will cost lives.
Everyone can now just wait.
One of the people who were never able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) is suspected of being exposed to asbestos in hospitals.
“I worked at a hospital where asbestos was shown,” she says, “but in my case, I can’t prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got caught up in something like cold.
He was 45 years old, he was in the middle of an operation.
All of a sudden, I was shaking.
It came at the same time.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain was coming from an excavator, pustules around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
Eventually, he spent a month at home.
The confused doctors made him a chest X-ray and introduced his thoracic catheter to remove the fluid he sent for analysis from his lungs.
Yet they didn't determine the diagnosis.
His condition has improved slowly and returned to work.
But from time to time, his symptoms returned, often after he exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients with similar symptoms came to the O.R. and was then diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and got in direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his pictures from CT and X-ray with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he was put into space between the chest ventilator and lung spatula with a camera.
I'm an optimist.
I tend not to take much," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't so worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy results came between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started meeting with the sisters from the Macmillan charity organization, and one advised him to contact the lawyer.
That's when he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipe,” he says.
Now the disease begins to manifest in those buildings of asbestos.
Thus, the mesoteliom is now beginning to concern younger people who do not have a risk profession.
The most dangerous tubes heat-insulated with asbestos in hospitals were in the basement, so it was unlikely that they would threaten patients.
Of course, members of staff who passed through basement corridors between buildings (as Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as often as Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it appears now, several decades after the war the hospital was a place where patients could have saved their lives, but also a place that could have threatened the lives of doctors who had treated them.
Asbestos is being removed to this day.
Students put Bunsen Kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just about the hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulating and inflammable qualities.
School, too.
In fact, many people of asbestos were exposed at school.
In countless hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos pad.
There was a website dealing with asbestos in schools.
The harmless items, such as floor tiles or roofs of shelters on tools in our homes, normally contained asbestos.
“This is an industrial poison built into a large amount of houses,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with the asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma was able to remember in the 1970s when the garden house was collapsing.
So be careful how you crash a garden house.
Knowing that disease is incurable, the impact of diagnosis is enormous.
“It takes you a while to figure it out,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I found out I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in the O.R. for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't be able to live another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the switch from doctor to patient position.
As an countless number of patients before him and he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all this," he says.
“I asked my doctor: “How much time do I have left?
I was told 12 months.
I remember thinking: “Well, I'm not gonna live to see another Christmas.
That's what it is."
Mesoteliom is especially destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills us.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos are fine fibres.
When asbestos breaks and the fibers breathe in, they can settle in an iris, a pulmonary gulf.
Asbestos fibers are irritant and can cause cell mutation.
“The problem is breathable asbestos fibres in the form of needles,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, cardiosurgeon, who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knew and treated other patients who were asbestos likely exposed during practice in the hospital.
The asbestos needles get into the tissue of the lungs, says Treasure, and “the breath alone is pushing at the edge of where the ostre is located.
He's invasive from the very beginning.
For mesothelioma, the usual therapeutic options used in other cancers do not work as much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is being discussed hotly.
Some say she'd be worth a shot.
Treasure doesn't agree.
"You cannot remove the mulch," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer "not responding to chemotherapy" which, although "has any effect," does not cure.
“Sometimes someone who survives lung cancer occurs,” says Treasure.
But in the end, everyone dies.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after Graham Abbott's own diagnosis, he's still fighting.
After finding mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and advisor to the same people affected.
When they called, he happily introduced himself: “Good morning, you have reached the cancer headquarters. ”
“He was very positive,” says Abbott.
His disease was diagnosed four years ago, and he was still very active.
At the beginning, the Abbotts offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months, and probably would only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, “has shown things in a more optimistic light. ”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the chest surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me, but I just called and they looked me up," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a claim, and they'd have to approve a paycheck.
To get to the best available treatment, money is key to patients with mesothelioma.
But when various treatments eventually inevitably fail, many patients face other financial concerns - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful," says Morgan.
However, in the 1960 ’ s, it was found that even its very small amounts could pose a health risk.
And here we meet with the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled down, but Morgan said it wasn't a "full settlement" because Lawson couldn't definitively prove that mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
After the investigation, however, spokesperson Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbest in the incriminating basement was removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Seducing the exposure of mortal asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after it happened - for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation it turned out to be a huge problem.
A lot of former workplaces have changed the owner or gone bankrupt.
Insurance records are missing.
And those who are now defending themselves have time on their side, which is certainly not their accusers.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation was approved this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to make compensation even if it is not possible to track their former employer.
The law created a 350 million financial reserve paid by insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos, but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally assign to them as compensation - around £120,000.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like the mesothelioma patients, thinks that £ 350 million is a "good job".
“It is an agreement signed by insurance companies,” she says, “and points out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if they hadn’t lost time and people with mesothelioma would have been able to reach the former employers and in a normal way to sue them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps.”
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths every year, there was a need for quick action.
"People too suffer and need help now," said Penning in December last year during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Act.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
Following the initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought he had a positive effect.
Following surgery, radiation and chemotherapy were followed by triple therapy, which boasted a survival rate of five to 40% of patients.
Abbott made it stronger.
"This is not the most important thing, of course," says Abbott.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get very badly worse.
Graham Abbott had an operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The inspections showed no signs of disease.
I went to further control in March [2014].
I had several stains in my chest [rapid].
My 50th birthday was just coming up.
It doesn't threaten life.
He'll take it.
Abbott has re-entered six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no evidence of a tumor in his body at present.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security, when I die, or to show a woman how a boiler alarm works.
When you hear the bad news, you start to get negative.
You need to look ahead.
Like Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” she says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly we got a lot of people calling.
Ellie was more restrictive.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients must face conversations like this.
In mesothelioma patients, however, such conversations are not lightened by hope or just a hint of survival.
The disease brings with it (and finally brought Stephen Jay Gould) an unfortunate certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mestoteliom does not threaten life. ”

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
Despite the multiple discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow candidates in Hong Kong to nominate before the 2017 elections.
It is likely that this step will trigger long promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists have started to organize and prepare only a few hours after this notification.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“We were not surprised, but we were angry,” said legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's clear we're dealing with an authoritative regime.
In the defence of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee on National People's Congress Li Fei said that allowing public nomination in the Hong Kong elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong's administration to China, Beijing has promised that citizens will be able to vote in power from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leaders presented Sunday’s decisions as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong allows for direct voting, but the decision also makes it clear that China’s leaders are holding firmly in the hands of the nomination process of the committee, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded one of Hong Kong's largest protests in several years.
Mostly the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are the "occupation of the Centre" with love and peace, which has been threatened by the closure of the financial quarter by the organizers, unless Beijing grants them a general voting right.
On Sunday night, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement gathered in the rain before the Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, the organizers reported that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would open waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online declaration, the organizers said that the movement “were considering the occupation of the Centre only as a last step in the event that all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to announce today that all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the Centre is inevitable.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing to notify Beijing for days and strengthened the protection of the government headquarters on Sunday and deployed police and barricades.
According to many Hong Kong residents, the incitement of unrest is marked by the fact that it is slowly losing control of the city.
Influence of land people increases competition in products and services.
There is also growing fear that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are bent down by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the occupation movement of the Central and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - the Hong Kong lifeboat.
“The protest he is talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long,” says Regina Ip, a politician who has long been criticizing the movement.
We do not want the fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perception could damage the investment.
China’s state media has also in recent days come up with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong express as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, with 780 000 participants - more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
A pre-electary agitator?
The Jihlava League is called according to the political movement
A small kick is played by approximately 1,600 amateur athletes in the town of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is now called Together for the Jihlava League.
The name was given according to one movement going to the October municipal elections.
Moreover, the tenth on his candidate is the boss of the small digged Jihlava Jan Mrák.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem," said Mrak.
The lawyers of the Jihlava City Hall were already looking at the situation around the first league, and they recommended to change the subsidy distribution system.
A small digger got about a million crowns from the city's website last year.
Even this year it's an amount in hundreds of thousands.
In the legal opinion, the small-earned procedure is not contrary to the laws and regulations of the Magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Authority to adjust the rules for the allocation of grants and subsidies," said Radek Tulis, spokesperson.
Draw subsidies from the city and at the same time expressing it as a small dumped support in the elections of one political party, that's probably not going to happen anymore.
The high-level "big" football has not yet come to a similar demand from politicians.
That it would be necessary to create a ČSSD regional refurbishment, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And the class and the likes of competitions?
I wouldn't be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like the sponsors from among companies to contact us," said Miroslav Vrzáček, the chairman of the regional football union.
Little football bosses don't let other parties go and the league movement doesn't let go.
According to players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own premises with six playgrounds, wardrobes and social facilities.
"For example, the court on the stand is not ours, we are there in rent," said Andrew Lapeš of Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
But there will be, for example, built in my opinion, a senseless area for skiers, which is in the Jihlava about 50," said Mrák.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that a small kicker uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošické and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build a playground that has maximum use.
We are planning to modernize or build a sports centre at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been huge progress for a small kick in recent years," he said.
Another political party in the names of the league will not appear according to Jan Mráky.
We have limitations.
If anyone enters our partnership, we don't put the other one there anymore," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider that at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldan, a member of the Council Committee on Sport.
"But whether the voters assess whether Mr.Mrraka is using the association of Little Kicked Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates university life - freshmen can fly jet aircraft
We are pleased to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private Rolls-Royce Phantom jet or cars, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service has a security website.
Servis is an ideal opportunity for students who would otherwise have to drag their things across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We are looking forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important frisher - a very important freshman) variants this year we will ensure that students arrive at the University with a minimum of nervousness and maximum luxury.
The spokesperson said that since the services had just started, they had no reservations yet, but he added: “Students will start making reservations in the next few weeks. ”
The company also stated that although students pay £9 000 a year's schooling, it expects the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, students today are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students who enter the university this month must, before they throw out thousands of pounds for something as simple as coming to college, deal with the financial crisis, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists are opposed to racism and police behavior after the events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson killed an unarmed young man in Missouri.
The present ones waiting for a funeral with their hands up, chanting, "Hand up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, due to the shooting of an unarmed young man named Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez recorded a shift in the online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer sex before race.
With increasing tensions in the Midwest, which attracted attention to the national press, Perézová noticed that white women’s reactions were 100% focused on race.
Compared to black women's reactions shortly after the shooting on 9 August, personal articles with headlines such as "the thought of white woman over Ferguson" or "Feminism is not only about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this represents an important change.
“I think there are not many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privileges at such a level,” she said.
People felt that they had to express themselves to what had happened.
For the crisis that we are facing, it is characteristic because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially winning that they had to draw attention to it.
According to a professor of English at the State University of Ohio, Coritha Mitchell brought Ferguson to light problems that African-Americans must face every day and which are not perceived as "female questions".
"I can publish funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and get 150 lyes from people around the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the colorful being trapped in their own country, it's deafening.
"How can a woman talk publicly about relationships, but not about public space security?" she asked.
There is no question of race and gender dichotomy for black women like Mitchell who have dealt with race, gender and sexuality in American history.
According to her, black women could not afford luxury to share these problems clearly: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Despite the question of race and gender today in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's question and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was almost in all cases rape of white women," Hattery said.
You needed white boys to justify lynching.
According to Hattery, the gap between whites and blacks came when a fighter for an electoral right like Susan B. Anthony investigated the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or black could have electoral right.
“They decided to place their cards on the voting right for women and on the right for blacks to focus later,” explained Hattery.
When we realize this, we get an important view of why color women don't believe white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We've never helped black people protect their husbands and their children.
Even after women gained electoral right in 1920, it took ten years for women to organize against lynching in the Association of the Southern Women to prevent lynching.
The group was established for 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to the questions raised by the police's behaviour, racial discrimination, reflects the time when white feminists had to "encourage" the questions that black women had to face for generations.
"It would not be great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they did the right to contraception?" Mitchell brought it up.
The second wave of feminists who have made their careers fighting for reproductive law and access to contraception are now finding out what it means.
Important feminist activists like Gloria Steine took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by Facebook, where they published a column of Rebecca Carroll from Guardian, who demanded white Americans to protest against racism.
"I hope that women who have different yet similar reasons for understanding the dangers of society - and the views of race, which differ significantly in public opinion surveys - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem is in favour of intersective feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, her comments on the race issue in America some people are confusing.
Experts from the American Enterprise Institute of Christina Sommers, author of the book "Who Stolen Feminism?", said She The People, that young men in the United States, especially young colorful men, are "more vulnerable than their sisters", but the notes of Steinem's side of Ferguson are facing the criticisms that she had caused earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program My Brother's Keeper, which was to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused an angry reaction to many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that comes to the fore of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police arrested almost 63,000 youths without accompaniment this year in the southwestern country, the issue of reforming immigration laws was once again raised - this time as a female question.
Andrea Mercad, co-chaired by We Belong Together, an organization that mobilises women for reforming immigration laws, said that in order to be able to raise the question as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He talks for himself," says Mercad.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them will find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories are recorded in women's organizations," she said.
The pig housing in Ipswichi for sale
The real estate agency removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, rested on it in the living room of the pig.
One-room single house, which is for sale for £120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photos included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the pig's couch.
The real estate agency Connells said that the pig in the photograph is a pet owner.
"The photo was mistaken, and that is why it was already removed," the spokesperson said.
In real estate information Connells described the former prayer hall as "the only single single room house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in the promotional material.
The sale of the house caused interest in social networks, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
The lottery player at Harvey gets a million.
There's a search for a new millionaire in the south-east of Pertha, a lucky guy taking $1.1 million from a Saturday lottery campaign.
Trafics in Harvey have been lucky for the second time in five years, the last time in November 2009 was one million dollars.
But the lucky winner has yet to sign up.
The owner of the Steve Forward store said that the entire city is talking about winning in the southwestern Pertha.
It's the main topic, and everyone's agitated.
We thought a similar win was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia split one win last month, ending a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five millionaires in August, and only a few weeks earlier, a couple in Belmont won an incredible 7.5 million dollars.
The winning couple had been betting for 20 years and said that winnings would allow them to travel around the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey Millionaire is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, totaling $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn's trains aren't leaving tonight.
Machines want higher wages
In his press release, GDL referred to the protest as a warning strike, for which he deliberately chose time off the track.
In the time of strike, GDL takes into account many people who return from the weekend on the railway until the first working day.
At the same time, we think of people coming for work during the day," the trade union said on Monday morning in the press release of the strike.
"Our first strike should hit mainly freight, less passengers," GDL added.
The DB has not yet published an official response to the strike.
It is not even clear how the protest action touches international rail connections, including the Czech Republic.
The unions demand an increase in driver's wages by five percent and a reduction in working time by two hours a week.
At present, the average salary of the drivers is between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998,000 and 1.27 million crowns) per year.
Machine leaders at DB work 39 hours a week.
DBs refuse to accept wage growth when shortening working time.
They point out that wage assessment of drivers must be developed in the same way as for other railway personnel with a DB not counting the working week.
The threat was that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why he ended up at Barum Rallye.
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think anything like this would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust repair temporarily and continue at a slower pace in the service, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we were to head straight ahead, yes.
But there were two more eras waiting for us, and that couldn't be done.
It's got a high temperature, and the risk of the car burning, it's a big one.
I can't afford that.
You've done five full speed tests.
How did you feel about them?
Very good.
I felt young.
We were quick, and I didn't go through the blame.
Everything was caused by the fact that we've been pipulating the car for more than six months to be on some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You ran him over so you could actually think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The job didn't come at all.
On the other hand, the outcome that we might have thought about has not come to light.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the tech said no.
You weren't the only one who stepped out of a first-rate fight.
It was also released by foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi.
Did it surprise you that so many favorites have resigned?
Yes.
It was a shame for the audience, especially because the race was over early.
Jaromír Tarabus, who you're planning a car, has been on top for a long time.
But he paid to leave the track and picked up a nearly two-minute-old man.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the degree of winners.
It was the first time he'd seen it.
But Mira also confirmed that we've prepared the car well.
He was driving really fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the Barum Rally.
Can you make a regular rally player feel good about driving again?
I'm sure not at the moment.
I said last year that Barumka was my last race, and I still didn't get it.
I decided I'd drive her again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I think I'm gonna go for it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy that?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you after Barumca?
The team's moving on.
Next week, we'll go to Vyskov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow Honza Sykora's fabia for this race from us.
With Mira, we will have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We're gonna have to do this next year.
Is there anything you can suggest?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Korsická rallye belonged to the World Cup, you reached your top five in the series.
Doesn't it tempt you to try the track again?
She's not.
The oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not been given a doctor's certificate of incapacity, which serves as proof to the organization that you cannot do work for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify the employer of the absence.
Thereafter, there was an agreement that the days would be recorded as a vacation, but the agreement only took place orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer's consent confirmed in writing with drawing leave, this procedure has been proven in practice.
If there's only an oral agreement, you don't have an agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take a vacation, as well as in your case, may be denied and absent at work considered as a long-term unexplained absence, therefore the reason for the immediate termination of the employment relationship under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the case of a court dispute about a deal with the employer, you do not have any proven evidence.
The working relationship with you has not been cancelled according to § 53, only you have given the given days in the credit sheet as an unforgivable absence.
The unspoken absence in the credit sheet does not have the same consequences as Section 53 (e.g. the impossibility to receive material security in unemployment), yet this makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have him confirmed in writing that there has been an accident, as a result of which you have been unable to work (it is not a so-called "incomprehension", it is only a doctor's document).
If you are looking for a new job, you can present the above document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity and the early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to the drawing of leave.
You're avoiding any possible complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his return to the track
The return to the track ended with Tony Stewart just a little behind the half of Atlanta Motor Speedway racing track.
Stewart hit the fence the second time after his right front tire burst in 172.
Stewart drove a damaged car into the garage, didn't tell the reporters and left.
The boss of his team Chad Johnston said that car number 14 was disappointed, but he's now going to be focusing on a race in Richmond, Virginia, which is going to take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have a better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do more.
Stewart crashed into the castle for the first time on a Sunday night race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repairing his car's right side.
"We put hope for a good ending in today's race," said Johnston, saying, "it just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was packed up and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and he needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the following race in Richmond to catch up with the place in the table.
He returned to the race during the investigation of a tragic accident that killed a 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. who drove Stewart in the road during the race.
The authorities said that it would take at least another two weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
So far, Stewart hasn't decided to face any charges.
The three-time champion had a warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the start of the race he developed to 10th and then even to 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, the Busch car no.
18 got out of control, went out of the second corner, and hit Stewart, which sent both cars to the fence.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague has selected a new taxi station manager, makes 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new tax service manager.
For 103 parking stops he will receive approximately 12.3 million crowns per year.
Until then, she picked 150 thousand crowns for the same places for taxi drivers each year.
Councilman Luke Manhart (TOP 09) informed about this.
Previously, the city used to draw lots when choosing wardens.
The winner then won the rental for a flat amount of CZK 1000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
It is currently deciding the amount of the tender.
"A year after the termination of the original lease contracts and the opening of the tendering procedures, it has proved that the new lease system for Prague is far more favourable and generally fairer," says the councillor.
The most expensive spot is Na Perštína
The highest price was offered by the interested parties for a post in Na Perštýn street.
He'll pay $2.1 million a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns the new administrators paid for places in front of the Municipal House or the Wenceslas Square.
The Council adopted the new rules on the rental of taxi service facilities in autumn 2012 and declared the original lease contracts in summer last year.
The selection procedure was held in four waves and 29 posts were found by the new administrator.
For the second time, we had to clean the well this year.
We let her go every time, which created practically the second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo there.
An incredible smell!
Our well in the basement has always provided enough wonderful scented water.
And that wasn't professionally done, that old man spooked her with his help.
A long time ago.
She was just at three contritions and overall she was special, like everything else at the cabin, but like I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we exhausted the water.
She deserved it when she was standing there for months.
But then we thought the water didn't smell like water.
We were wondering if something fell in there.
In a place where the pump was going, it was possible at a bit of bad luck, the board did not quite stick, so the hole was sealed by a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing visible in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we released her again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we improved the improvised seal around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
There was a taped package on the ground with some cubes.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a drool mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where the vents were, the grandfather's inventions were left over!
And it's heavy.
Our basement is unique, too.
Some would've thought Grandpa was just digging up the cabin.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just suffocated with sand, only the ceiling is beaten.
Ships are mainly used there.
And wheels.
And beach chairs.
The door with wide gaps was mostly open, as someone walked in there all the time.
At the ceiling, several already mentioned vents.
Without the nets, so they usually fly birds and build nests on the beams.
It's useless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be fuzzy, and that's what he wanted.
Now, of course, he didn't even help.
The whole basement smelled.
So we cleaned up the whole basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw out things that were around: boards, a heraclith board, and stuff like that.
Our cabin at a distance was welcomed by a passing disinfectant.
We were wondering who might have dragged those disgusting remains out there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers away in the village.
It would be hard for us to have a snack.
My grandfather attacked a neighbor who's not all right.
Didn't Franta give us the disgustingness in there?
He's been here practically all year, dumb ideas, he's got it.
We decided to keep an eye on the cellar and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing until the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water out of a forest well is nothing I want to do for a long time.
Once upon a time, we heard our bitch's horrific anxieties.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, strong black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Réza hopped over her and plowed her like a fool.
Mom used to tell her 'cause she thought Réza dug up the waste hose from the sink.
All of a sudden, the hose was partly sold into the club and partly resembling.
The balcony was soaked.
Réza got a hysterical attack.
We ran down.
She was about to swallow a huge toad, and Réza was defending her.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the strain in the form of our whole family, she probably said, "Let's eat it when we're so hungry, and she's swaying her breath to the basement."
We were on our way to see her.
As a lightning bolt, she jumped by the well.
By the way, we recorded another stinking package on her board.
It's probably fishy, according to the smell.
She wasn't there yesterday!
Our new pump protection was a bit of a shejder.
And we closed the basement for the day.
That he'd...
We went out there, and that's where we each stuck to one breath.
We didn't wait long.
It fucked up at the well.
First a flat head appeared with yellow moons on its neck.
Then she threw herself out on the well a whole lot.
She got around the pump and started getting inside.
The fired employee took revenge, bought a laptop on the company and sold it
After release, a warmed-up employee bought it on a computer company and then sold it.
He could have spent the money before the police were arrested.
In a short time, a man bought in 12 cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"Notebooks after the takeover he left for Olomouc, where he sold them after the bazaars," said the Chief Commissioner of the Shumper Police of Rostislav Brückner.
The motive for fraud was the employer's revenge for release and money gain.
"In an interview, he said that he used the money to pay off his loans," said Brückner.
The police also found that the fraud is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated for psychiatry.
So the money could also have ended up in the winning instruments or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money in him," the Commissioner said.
A fraud who has already been punished for theft has now threatened to stay in prison for up to five years.
So far, the police have not yet told whether there is a threat of punishment to the bazaars who bought and sold the notebooks.
"It is true that they have taken over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner said.
However, none of the base owners have yet been charged.
Come on, just a little bit longer, you can do it or as I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year the organizers prepared some changes for us.
The biggest was the change in the route that brought the target to the flood instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of Rungo.cz the team, but I was going to experience it a little bit from the other side.
The whole team and I decided to personally greet our readers at the stand where we took pictures and filmed videos together.
In order to advance my view on the other hand to perfection, I accepted the role of a personal conductor.
My friend Kaťa and I, just before the start, listened to the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes.
My friends and I were walking around in the sector for faster runners.
There's not much time left.
A couple of jumps to heat up, turn on the athletes, the countdown and start!
The screams of the gladness, but instead of a quick start, the whispering to the starting line followed.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, we turn on the measurements, and we run at a pace of ten.
We're going through with a yellow snake of runners, who, like Katya, are running their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, slowly falling sun in the sky adds a view of Vyšehrad almost to a cheesy breath.
The pulsating meats on the waterfront look like Prague's whole thing's running here.
On the waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to manifest who has the power.
The light hill on Palacké Square forces many runners to slow down or go to walk.
Just before the run to the Theatre, I see a police escort, and right behind him is Vík Pavlišta flying at an incredible pace to the finish.
I hear the admirable smelling of the other runners.
I'm moving to the edge of the track, encouraging him, he's going to slap me, but right before that, my leg is going to drill and our hands are going to pass.
The Convention of Theatre Street gives you a chance of a short rest and a breath.
There's a need, there's a place ahead of us where I can get my perspectives out.
The rotation on Manes Bridge shows Prague in the whole beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing, and my legs are carrying me almost by myself.
The moment of truth comes after the first refreshment.
During the crossing of Kaťa škobrtná road the curb and shows the jump of the swim.
I'm looking for help, and I'm running a series of encouraging words so they don't have time to think about the pain.
He picks up and continues with the Goat alley, it is one of the narrowest places of the track, although there is no such rush at this stage of the race, but there is still a need to monitor the surroundings well.
I do not yet know that the concept of the narrowest place will gain its true meaning later.
Behind the Press Gate we are encouraged by ferretists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to clap with anyone who offers a hand, and I'm recommending it to Kata, because ten applause with fans is like half an energy bar.
It's really working, we're speeding up again, and although we've been down a lot, now we're on a fighter run.
We're running ahead of dozens of runners, when I'm having someone particularly tired, I'm trying to cheer him up with a few words: "Come on, just a little bit longer, you can do it!"
We're no longer running behind the last snack. We're speeding up.
So far, we've run for an hour and a quarter, we add, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish line will hurt, but we really need to squeeze.
The sun has slowly collapsed and the end of the day symbolically stops the race.
The last run on the bridge, the spin, and just a straight line to the finish.
The speed we're running is amazes me, where's that girl coming from?
"Come on, we're going under 13 o'clock, we're working!" I'm calling.
We're trying, sprinting, and there's a target.
One hour 13 and six seconds.
Well, what can be done?
Coach set a 20-hour limit.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Closely for the purpose of Kata's feet are broken, helping her with the railing where she's resting for a while.
It can see exhaustion, but also happiness from well - being performances.
After a while, I'm slowly taking her out of target space.
Euphoria doesn't let us think about the button in the closet passages.
Here you can see the Cossacks weren't the closest place.
That means almost ten thousand runners are stuck to the ground here for the target of a bulge that is under the strain.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for him.
I, too, am losing my mind for a while, wondering if those wonderful views and compared to previous years, the more interesting route was worth what's going on in the finish line.
I know from my own experience that organising a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people add to this, a rich accompanying programme and the closure of the entire Prague centre for all transport, this is a huge challenge.
This year's course change has shown many interesting places for runners, but it has also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped in the Yellow Baths moved between the runner and the race itself.
The organizers of the track and random viewers would step it up on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, when the city's historical center runs, I must count on obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of a mass plant in a place that is bordered on one side by the wall and on the other by the river, I do not consider it the best solution.
If I think the race ended with a goal, I'm going to evaluate it as a very successful race.
In order to achieve this, I had a bit of a concern about the health of the involved, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write to us in the discussion if you liked the route and what you're saying about the situation in the finish line.
Prisoners in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison staff throughout Bulgaria attended a national protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
To the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their request to reintroduce the original working conditions that have changed recently.
There are also higher salaries on the list of requirements to be discussed with the provisional Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The overseers of the month were symbolically protesting against new working hours and demanding a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the prison overseers' and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) informed them.
“The negotiations are still taking place,” said BNR Head of the Directorate-General of Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
The members of the Federation of Trade Organisations of Employees at the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protests of the prison service.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we can't see them
Physicalists usually don't write best sellers, but Brian Green from Columbia University hit black in 1999.
His book Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the violin problems that many theoretical physicists are dealing today - trying to unite two excellent but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is, in case of finding a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
The basic physical problem between the two key theories (although at this point our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has solved and thus solves ingeniously that it is worth retelling even to laymen.
In addition, Greene advised with the complex material so fresh and enticed that it was not possible to blame how much interesting he did not include in his book.
Moreover, he fixed his "miss" most of the time in two other books: the structure of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
Apparently the author would not object to his book being taken care of more quickly, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything that an informed layman with ambition would understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a little more lively in this area (because the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas") and so it is a good time to enter Greene's nonviolent door of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may certainly sound foolish, fantastic, strangely or mystic.
Yet it is concrete and totally acceptable.
To understand this, let us for a moment turn our eyesight from the universe as a whole to something more favorable, specifically, to a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that you pull a 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and follow the whole scenery from a half-mile distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From a distance like this, you can easily notice a long hose in the horizontal direction, but if you do not suffer from sharp vision, you will hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given your great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
If someone asks you where the ant was at a given time, you will answer him with only one word: distance of ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a half a kilometer distance, a long piece of the hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, he has a hose of thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we will suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle opening a hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that an ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-right dimension over the length of the hose, but also in a "dimensional direction of movement of the clock hands", i.e. around the circumferential diameter of the hose.
You're beginning to understand that you have to enter two numbers to determine the location of the little ant: how far away it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle opening the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (the experts will see that this chapter focuses purely on the fault theory of string.
The non-motional aspects are discussed in chapters 12 and 13).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, a dimension in the direction of the circuit, marked with a circular arrow, it is short and pivot.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The dimension of the opening circuit of the hose is short, "circumcised" and less noticeable.
In order to realise the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates the important feature of spatial dimensions.
That they split into two groups.
They can be either large, wide, and therefore directly visible, or small, plucky and much worse observable.
Of course, in the above case, we have not quite resolved to reveal the "spinning" dimension of the opening hose.
All you had to do was take a telescope to help you.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we'd only reveal the twisted dimension with a lot of effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he delivered with the stunning idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three of us all known dimensions.
The Kaluza’s radical claim was justified by the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory of vett into a single, unified concept structure.
It immediately raises the question of how this Kalus observation goes together with the obvious fact that we see exactly three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines, which he clearly expressed and specified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and pivot dimensions.
This means that as well as the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, large and lightly visible three dimensions, whose existence at every moment we realize.
But analogically with the ring circuit of the garden hose, the universe can have an additional dimension, firmly wrapped into space so small that they have remained hidden from our most advanced experimental apparatus.
In order to get a clearer idea of the essence of Kalus’ remarkable proposal, let us stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine that on the hose circuit we will draw in black color a relatively dense line of circles.
The hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With a telescope now, we will discover the pivot dimension of the dimension easily, since we will see the theme from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein have come up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, a total of four space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little bit, notice the illustration of Figure 3; it shows two great dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the image we increase the view of geometry space as we have increased the surface of the hose.
Each following level represents a huge enlargement of the geometry of the space from the level before.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them on the fourth level of enlargement) if they're screwed into a small enough space; we explain that we haven't seen them directly yet.
The square network represents a commonly known "big" dimension, while the circle of a new, raspberry and a twisted dimension.
Just like loops of yarns in densely woven carpets, even these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - we only covered them into intersections in the square network because of their visibility.
The background of Figure 4 represents a commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such normal scales as meters, illustrated side of a small square in a square network.
In each of the following pictures we will focus on the small area of the picture before; we will enlarge it to become visible.
At first, nothing special is happening, as we see at several first levels of enlargement.
However, if we follow the microscopic characteristics of the geometry of the space further - to the fourth level of enlargement in Figure 3 - we will suddenly see a new one, in the shape of a circle of a pivot dimension, similar to a loop of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that the additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions as well as the hose circular circuit at each point of its length.
In the interest of opinion, we have only covered the circular dimension in some regularly distributed points.
Figure 4 Kalusov and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space summarizes.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although there are also important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), whereas the hose has only one large dimension.
Even more important is the fact that we are talking about space geometry of the universe itself, not just an object within the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it - as well as the circumference of the hose - is much more difficult than to observe obvious, large and large dimensions.
If the size of an additional dimension is small enough, it will actually be exposed above the power of our most modern enlargement tools.
The most important thing is that the additional dimension is not just a round lump inside the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension, which exists at each point of three common large dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions independent as are the dimensions from the top-down, from the left-to-right and from the front-to-back independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A small enough ant could move in all four dimensions, and we would need four figures to determine his position, except for the three common still positions in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kalus and Klein's thinking shows that this does not preclude the existence of additional scales of the pigs if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with a mere eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can identify the structures of the great billionth of a billionth of a meter.
We can barely observe a smaller pruning dimension.
In 1926 Klein combined the original Kalus idea with several ideas from the just-born quantum mechanics.
Its calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could have the size of about one Planck length, which is far beyond the distinguishing capabilities of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions of Kalus-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises how to practice on the electric guitar: 5th part
The whole nature of "twenties" consists in a twelve-vitac harmonious form, which you can freely repeat.
Whoever's snooping in music theory will find her principle explained here in detail.
Jan Homola, or Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
By educating a puppet and a puppet conductor whose Facebook profile can be watched here, they have been living as a graphic artist since graduation 20 years ago.
He's a guitarist in the Wohnist band, which, unfortunately, can't be left.
A guitarist is after his father, just like Brother Matìj, leader of the Wohn.
Start training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can think of anything, then you just apply it to the harmonious model of the twelfth," says Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what can be done with the 12th harmony on two strings, and how it's starting to sound.
If you pick up a third string, you can already cobble with a tune of some songs.
When you finally add the fourth one, watch out for changing the tune, it alerts Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza goes back to the pentatone and you try putting it together with a 12-pack.
So practice it honestly.
To the best of all, you will read in an interview with Jane Homola at the first lesson of his school play on the electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for the big celebration, admits the castle court
We take the point and we're happy for it.
The first half had more chances of us, the second house," said the attacker, who scored from the penalty kick this time.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, after all, when he was accompanied by a huge whistle?
I didn't particularly notice it, although on the second goal where there are fans, it'd probably be worse.
You've settled the penalty in half an hour, but you've also received a goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We slept the beginning, we were passive, it came from the corner, and then the penalty.
You got up after her, and the first half was a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that after the goal we played well until intermission.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep up the pace of the game, but we couldn't.
To be honest, I can't even explain why.
But it's probably also true that the house said something about their game's break, they probably weren't very happy with it.
You only scored for the first time on the field while at home you may not have scored a goal.
Why is it so different?
I don't think it's the difference, but it depends on how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad of us, Plzeň, that's another category.
You waited for a goal for four games, didn't you worry it might be similar after the last match?
I don't think so, but, of course, we're glad that we haven't had to talk about waiting for the goal since the last game.
Now we've added another one without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which is not yet a great celebration.
Iceland - the lava flows from a mile away crater.
Lava flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull iceberg, flows through an underground tunnel from a mile away crater.
It is located under the iceberg, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now concerns scientists the most...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
From yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) It still flies out of the puck approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but only 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
But scientists fear that the lava tunnel could be opened even in places where it is below the ice.
If this were to happen, with the same intensity as the current eruptions, it would mean huge floods, both on the river Jökulsá á Fjöllum and on other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulphur in the area of the eruption, and the clouds of steam and gases are rising from the cracks.
It is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the Fimmvörðuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger, and there are many more gases," says Vulcanologist Armann Hösculdsson.
The weather has improved considerably since yesterday, but in the morning it was almost windless in the area.
The traces of the sandstorm were washed away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air operations the orange level (second highest) applies to Barðarbung and yellow (third) for Askja.
The sky over Chebe belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
Walking through the wings
Air day in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 introduced the flight acrobat Peggy Walentin, who, during the flight, came out of the cockpit to the game on the upper wing of the two platform and also between the wings.
There it is referred only to the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Cheb was already the fifth time this year, and the organizers again managed to prepare some interesting air pieces.
At the oldest Czech airport, the premiere was held not only by "walking the wings" in the form of German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also by legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his glowing cover.
An acrobacy called Wingwalking is originating in the United States.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried to enforce.
But he was banned because of a large number of fatal injuries.
Today, however, it slowly returns to the program of air days.
Peggy comes out of the cockpit on the top wing after the launch.
That's where he's doing all kinds of exercises.
At the end of the performance, it will move to space between the wings of the aircraft, where its show continues," described Ludek Matìíček from the Chebské Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The Boeing Stearman 75 E pilot is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the following performance of the Mustang fighter was a famous cherry on the cake.
Legendary fighter came to the surface with Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in a curtain (also called on numbers).
Such a set-up could be seen by air fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then demonstrated to everyone the breathtaking acrobatics with an airplane from 1945.
He was made in the war, but he probably never took part in it.
He was included in the military reserves.
Since 1963, he has been working in the civilian sphere.
Even as a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiště.
The same place is also another pearl of the Cheb flight day, a two-engine Beechcraft C45H Explo.
The airport didn't have the power to miss the machine.
His polished aluminium cover was glowing far away.
He also gained the machine Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French air force.
A small transport aircraft surprised for the abandoned Turbolet and from the German Hofu brought a part of the German delegation on the air day.
In Cheb, the German neighbours demonstrated themselves with renovated aircraft Like 18T or three-member formations of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return to camera!
At least Lucie Borhy replaced her family's worries for the work tonight.
Stress or nervousness - a blond moderator doesn't know any of this clearly.
Because she was doing well with modernized television news, as if she hadn't stopped with him for two months!
It's only been two weeks since blondes ended on Sundays, where women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not appear regularly in TV Nova's main news coverage.
Regular return is due according to Flash.cz in a month.
After all, only her daughter Linda needs it now more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a black shot.
Exhibitions in Prague for a year?
Hala would sell out, she's planning a bachelor party.
It would be worthy if something like this happened during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union will build up," said the Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden Match, in which the amazing Nagan team again met.
Even players who participated in the gold hattrick.
Players would like that, wouldn't they?
I'm sure.
It would just be good to say good-bye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, there are two days to find during the tournament where it is completely free and where to put such a match.
We're going to tell Gum (Jiře Šlégr) or Béď Ščerban (the organizer of the jihla fight) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with New Jersey Play-off?
So if I fly in like this...
But you don't want to play in the representation.
Or has the jillah meeting changed your decision?
Representations and exhibition matches are two different things and the performances are decisive in the representation.
One thing is, people would like to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who have a good name and not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed much.
How did you enjoy the naked reunion, anyway?
It was just the gamer meeting was great.
You've brought back stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for hockey players.
Of course, the most important was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that they're leaving a generation that's really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the platter.
Will you remember your first game of representation yourself?
They don't forget things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young men: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we entered one three.
It was the first representative start for all of them.
Well, you can't say that if we were to dominate in some way.
Jihlava after a long time was caught by Dominik Hasek.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan will never surprise me on ice.
I wanted to return it to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jagra for reasons he decided to end up in the representation).
Even the Hnil did a great job.
You were training with me once a night, and there he was.
And now he's catchin' the same thing.
First the US and then the Netherlands, the footballers begin their qualification
On Monday morning, prominent guests used to visit the hotel's NH Hotel.
People could have seen the goalkeeper Petr Čech of Chelsea, the representative coach Pavel Vrb...
And over there, the character in the black baseball cap, that's Tomáš Rosický!
Deputy Arsenal and captain of the representation arrived at the meeting around half-third in the last.
We have a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be pleased?" he said, when he came before the journalists in the stand.
Programme of Czech Representation
Monday 1st September: start of the reunion, first training
Tuesday 2nd September: Training for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogrammad (20:00)
Wednesday September 3rd Czechia - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czechia - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of meeting
Russian and Co. can support fans before the Wednesday match against the US (20:15).
The representation for them opened Tuesday training, which at Letná starts at 18:30.
And he will be followed by an autograph, which Rosický and Čech will not be missing.
Otherwise, this reunion of the national team will be more peaceful.
Which praises Coach Vrba, who complained about many social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we're gonna focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been so long until now," Vrba praised, which the national team has officially been leading since January.
The Czech football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The representation has three matches under Vrbo, all preliminaries.
With Norway and Finland, she rescheduled 2:2 and lost 1:2 with Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
That's only now.
The competition with the Netherlands will launch qualification for the European Championship 2016.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if the general could handle the US.
The first half year was for us to meet.
The results are important now.
We must think about being successful," Vrba said.
The only player of a 32-member nomination that has health problems is David Lafata's attacker.
The temperature's bothering him.
If he hadn't recovered into the U.S. Wednesday game, Coach Vrba would have called one more attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A British woman describes how she thought she was going to die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adulthood thinking that she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
The CMT UK Charity Organization stated that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because very little is known about the disease.
It is considered that CMT suffers from approximately 23,000 people in the United Kingdom, which may manifest symptoms in the area of motorics such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
Insensitivity or pain may also occur in the affected, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich’s ataxia (FA) disease, which has a very bad prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be tied up in a wheelchair, and she would be dead before she was 30.
A mother of two children now 51 says: “As a child, I knew that I could not do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and it took me longer.
I've never been able to ride roller skates or skateboards with other kids, and I've been bullyed at school because of walking and running."
When Rodgers was 13 and was after several surgeries that were supposed to release Achille's tendons and adjust her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room, and looked into her documentation, where she found out she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I looked up information about the illness in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” she says.
When they answered, I was shocked, and I completely panicked.
I thought before I was 18, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I was 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd lose all my powers.
I was on my own and I was planning a funeral."
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk did not get as much as she thought, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her and said: “Baby, I don’t think you have the disease, or you’d be in a wheelchair.
I think it's going to be something far less dangerous."
After a few genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a child of happiness," she said.
The CMT UK Charity Organization has launched a month of information about CMT to alert this disease.
D.C. entrepreneurs: taxes are taxed on the turnover of the economy
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local taxation of companies in the country with accelerated economic recovery increased slightly last year and firms in Washington were no exception.
Businessmen in Maryland and Virginia together for the 2013 fiscal year in state and local cash registers paid $27.6 billion, 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion selected in 2012.
Tax burden - state and local - rose by 4.3% last year to 671 billion dollars compared to 3.9% last year and it was the third growth year after 2009 and 2010, when taxes decreased.
According to the study carried out by Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3% than local contributions, by 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenues of the district, 56%, are from the trade tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows the proportionally smallest tax revenue from business.
Researchers argue that the majority of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which this year's property tax this year after three consecutive years with growth -1 % increased by 3,7 %.
Although most profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same situation is also in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vrigini paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, which represents an annual increase of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not so much push up the state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax represents less than a fifth of the company's tax.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax represents almost half of state and local taxation.
“In Maryland, he owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base in D.C., the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay taxes,” explains Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
A recent increase in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed only to a healing real estate market.
According to data, business revenues appear to also increase.
Companies in this region have published a corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, which increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected one billion dollars on corporate income taxes, most in the region.
Although they are taking the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs does not grow as quickly in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at national average, at 4.3%, while the growth of Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was an increase in taxes below the average, to 4,1 %.
Virginia has of all three districts (all of which have the same tax) the lowest corporate income tax, 6 %.
The tax rate of trading companies in Maryland is 8.25 %, while the average of D.C. remains relatively high, to 9.975 %.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and a generally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia is facing the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a law reducing the tax on companies from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will decrease to 5%.
If the State continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, the legal income tax rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businessmen in Washington are doing better, which is why higher state and local taxes are being paid.
Living tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax - the compensation structure for increasing costs by raising prices, according to which most companies are organised - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia - increased by 20% last year to 2.4 billion dollars much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and the national increase in trade tax will likely continue next year, the overall tax revenue from both government and local government sales will increase to 6.2% over the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington can fall behind others as the reduction in state spending is taxing itself on the labour market.
What you missed: The boss of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafat's scissors
Will a new state be created in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novoruska
Russian President Vladimír Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government forces and Russian insurgents have been meeting since April.
He also warned European companies that they would have a difficult return to the Russian market after the current regime of sanctions.
The support that the West provides for the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine, according to it, contradicts democratic values.
The end of the conflict he believes depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has exercised the right to disagree with parts
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is to propose the form of a further confirmation of the Russian sanctions within a week, decided by the EU Summit on the night of today.
A permanent chairman of the meeting of the Member States, Herman Van Rompuy, told the reporters.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, specific proposals to move the form of sanctions should be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye will replace in December
At the European Union summit, Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Council, the so-called EU President, who manages the summits of the Member States.
From December to December two and a half years, he will replace Herman Van Rompuy.
At the forefront of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton, Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian Vice-President of the future European Commission still has to confirm the European Parliament in his office.
Assisted death is reality in the Czech Republic, it's just not spoken of
Helping an incurable and long-term patient with his leaving life?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not permit euthanasia, that is legally impossible.
Yet, it follows from the comments of the doctors who addressed LN that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The most difficult chapter in neurology, says the doctor about sclerosis
The Czech Republic suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of approximately three hundred people, 21 patients undergoing experimental treatment of stem cells in Prague Motola.
We certainly don't know if it's going to be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, Motol neurologist.
There's a history of CIA manuscripts, they needed war, Huml writes about shooting down an MH17 flight.
The member of the ČSSD Stanislav Huml has made it clear who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "the hard sanctions that have been declared in the light of the shooting down of a civilian plane with almost 300 dead have deliberately caused the Ukrainian army".
According to the legislator, it's an addition to the CIA's manuscript.
Incomprehensible promises.
Options are coming up and the parties are offering again the impossible
No more homeless people on the streets, parking for each family and cableway above Prague.
It is repeated before each election: the parties promise impossible.
Politicians are now also overcoming with the upcoming municipal elections, who prefers the voters more.
The Lidovka.cz server chose incomprehensible promises from now and from the past.
70 years ago, Czechoslovakia landed at Dunkerque.
The siege began
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Her commander, Alois Liška, has consistently asked for the addition of technical equipment and the dispatch to the front.
Finally, the British Party complied with this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port town of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SOUHRN: Plzeň leads the league in front of Prague's "S", Liberec decalated Banník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, leading by point in front of both Prague's "S".
The changes in the front of the table caused the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats in the home league, Sparta recovered, beating Jablonec with two Lafat attacks.
The record win in the year was credited by Liberec, which shot up Banník Ostrava 6:0.
62 thousand viewers on the volleyball?
The Poles say yes
Introduction of MS Volleybalists in Warsaw brought the audience record.
At the football stadium, under the roof, 62 thousand people were watching a smooth win over Serbia.

How to survive your return from vacation?
Take your time and get some sleep.
The last days of the holiday are before us.
Get used to coming back from sunny beach or cottages at a normal work rate may be for many nuts.

Fortunately, there are good tips on how to cope with the changed situation: not to rush and enjoy a good night’s sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: "We hold our fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has said today that she is not losing hope of getting well.
"Thank you for your regards and support," said Melissa Rivers today.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after the emergency call, according to which she had a heart attack on the York Endoscopy in the Upper East Side, as the source said.
Doctors deliberately maintain it under sedation and strict supervision until they are confident of its condition, which remains “serious”.
The reactions did not allow long to wait, including unreal support on the Internet from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a twisted headline
That the media are twisting reality with their headlines, there is no news.
I know the headlines "sell" the paper, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, and the more consistent is the word is more upset.
This concerns, in particular, articles on the conflict of Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
The headlines "Israel Attacked Gaza" are quite common.
Only in the text will you read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the fired Gaza missiles, often at the time of the declared truce.
That's when the title "Both sides have broken the truce" appears.
Does the journalistic community realize that they are directly involved in anti-Semitic positions that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
Sixty years have not passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are survivors of Sho.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted "Jewish Pigs" and similar trustworthiness, I got stuck.
Is the world going to finish what didn't happen to Hitler?
Do our journalists realize the fact that the Jews were destined for the destruction of the Slovaks?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take care of your work a little more.
You are often referred to as "seeing the dogs of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend also the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your people.
How would you want our government to behave if one of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation would be eliminated and that the Czech Republic would wipe out the map of the world?
Maybe you should also be aware of one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're fine.
If you ask them why they don't go in between theirs, like Gaza, they'll answer you, why would they do it?
In Israel, they have work, social security and top health care (I saw myself as a top private hospital in Hadassa, which is funded by the donor gifts of Jews from all over the world, the Arabs, and of course, are treated there).
Hamas also attacks his Arab brothers with his missiles.
The only real help of Gaza, and thus of this restless area, is to rid her of Hamas and disarm him.
And not judge Israel, even indirectly in headlines.
Inform Hamas about his practices, his abuse of people as human shields.
Please note that Hamas is intended to destroy the State of Israel at any cost.
Even at the expense of the death of innocent Arab children.
Please inform Hamas is on the list of global terrorist organisations.
Please note that, in nine years' time, the Gaza Authority could have been thriving through humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, for which Gaza’s administrators do not pay and even get upset that sometimes the supply of electricity is interrupted.
If Hamas hadn't invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could penetrate suicide attackers in the territory of Israel, but, for example, the construction of housing homes, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would be much better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed the statement Information from Monday morning: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys $0.04 billion (970 million US dollars) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement caused surprise, not because nobody expected Twitch to buy, but because it was expected that the buyer would be YouTube.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Google looked certain in one billion, and this connection looked natural.
Twitch, who only started Justin.tv three years ago, was ready to become a commonly used video streaming service - a live YouTube version.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online transmissions from games – in the words of Business Insider “YouTube for Live Transmission Games”.
Interaface Twitch.
On YouTube there are already popular videos "Let's play", a species where the wiselanti (mostly older) give processing games to the mystery science theatre.
The fact is, YouTube comes to a lot when it's Twitche's description, so news that YouTube buysTwitch, nobody gets upset, it's a textbook example of how an established company pays off potential competition.
The guess is why the YouTube deal didn't come out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have is the CEO of Twitche Emmet Shear: “We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our society, have the same values and long-term vision and want to help us fulfill it faster.”
The next mystery is - honestly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snoozes like me who claim that sport prefers to do rather than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about playing instead of actually playing just watching.
One thing is to watch a friend across his shoulder at 3:00 a.m. playing Resident Evil, and another thing is to watch someone else get hit in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are from the player's perspective, so looking at their record without you being able to control your own perspective is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that the speed run games in which the Bannisters of our electronic time complete the game in record time are fun.
But if someone is not a master of playing or humor, his channel on Twitchi probably won't be very interesting.
But what do the skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is the fourth at the top of internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon use this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is mixing into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as if YouTube could swallow it.
Twitch has something that any company wants to attract: the hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Director Twitche Shear, Amazon, and Twitch said, "They believe in the future of games" and the media do not seem to be upset, nor like, swallowing, viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheistic vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the subject of "The Holy Scriptures are God's Word."
Original video attached.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by actual human authors.
When the faithful debate one of the many things that contradict their religion, they often put us before the question: Who will you believe?
The alleged word of God, or the word of man?
It's like human research is completely nothing compared to the authority they think it has.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to myths about the God written down by men.
If he really exists intelligent with a purpose, then he is the one who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and he must be the one who invented the genetic formulas that match it, and he must be the one who added a number of other evidence that points exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion into the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
He seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, plotting.
And they were people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be God's word.
Every supposedly holy doctrine of any religion in the world describes itself as written down by men, not gods.
People who were "inspiring" or "inspiring" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictatorship of angels, but those texts were not written by anyone other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and not gods at all.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire universe.
If a being such a greatness had ever written a book, there would have been only one book, a single scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not measure such works.
And people wouldn't have to trust her, because she would have been consistent, based on verified and true evidence, and would have revealed deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
She would constantly inspire each reader to unity of the common faith.
If God wrote it, we wouldn't expect anything smaller.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without common origins, and they all constantly fall into more and more separate denominations, seeking disputed truths, and each one claims God’s guidance in some way, regardless of the continued dissolution and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, Christian Gospel, Islamic Koran, Baha'u'llah Kitáb-i-Akdas, Zarathustre Avesta, Sikh Adi-Granth, Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all regarded as "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the only true god" and the believers of each of them say that the others are wrong.
The only logical explanation is that there's a certain amount of them all on the wrong path.
None of the books mentioned above have any advantage over the others.
None of them have any evidence of resistance, and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith, as well as apology (defences), because they contain irregularities, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it can't be said that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them are prophesying detestable atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy--with each being able to contain prophecy that was not fulfilled.
The theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often motivated political authors, explaining many of the oppositions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it an argument, rather a mutual commentary.
We need to point out again that there are two different authors, whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author, and he's certainly not telling an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish between four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. five books of the "Moses" and Moses do not credit any of them because they almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think it is.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Heleneism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a gnost faith, followed by docs and ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, who eventually combined in a compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups, like the Lutherans, were scattered and discredited by other Bible reviews.
One of these adjustments refers to King Ugarita, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers were a major threat to the young Moses religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to mock and Ba'al Zebula, "The Lord on the Mount" changed to Belzebub the "Lord of Much".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what became of the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of commission decisions at the House in Nikaji.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by simply lifting their hand, as if the fact of a matter could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers at that time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter at the Church of Jerusalem?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually found out that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved from the narrowness of the original church.
So the council simply accepted as the Gospel any relevant stories that flowed between uneducated masses at that time.
But they also knowingly removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referenced to them by the books that were approved.
Among the rejected items we will find writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are only words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved if God were the true author of this random mixer of reputation, parable, and psalm lyrics?
Surely the Bible was written to people and certainly not too enlightened, rather the contrary!
That's why so much of her content is entirely wrong, historically and scientifically, whatever it is, from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believed snakes and donkeys can talk, believe in spells, blood victims, ritual magic, enchanted objects, fiery twigs, astrology and five elements of magic.
They thought if they used the magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would cure him from the leper.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were chews and bats are birds and whales are fish and pi is the whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow-street patterns, they would give birth to striped calfs.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book didn't know that.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from a pen of truly superior being and was intended as literal history, then it would not contain anything that contains it at all.
As a moral guide, most of the original Hebrew writings have been written down by uneducated and bigoted savages who have overlooked or supported animal cruelty, incest, incessant, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, child abuse, child violence, abortion, plenary, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice to race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
But creationists keep ignoring all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any reality is contrary to the Bible, then reality must be ignored!
Why is that?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, there's one and the other.
It is ironic that they reject God's "work" as "the worship of creation instead of the Creator."
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and of the god himself and even insist that disprove their supposedly "holy" books somehow disprove God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creacionic Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate doctrine from God.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship a man-made compilation, as if these books were God himself, because they think they are Jehovah's word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected into their allegedly "alternative word" of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified and often also deliberately altered and twisted by mere people.

The attacker at the Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of whom died
A man named Chen, according to the agency New China, violently invaded the primary school building in the morning and attacked around half the eleventh local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed died later in the hospital.
He later killed himself by jumping from a height, said New China, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one descendant in accordance with government policy.
Zeman to the first-timers in Lány showed how he had to sit at school
The smallest schoolers took the ninth graders to their class, where they waited with the teacher for the president to come.
Then he showed the kids how he had to sit alone at school.
"We had to sit behind our backs, which, fortunately, doesn't wait for you, you're free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then handed over to the first boys as a gift to the puzzles.

Minister of Education Marcel Chládek started a new school year at a private sports school in Lithuania.
"This year I want more to link Czech education with Czech sport," one of the reasons why the first school day was published in the north of Bohemia.
School management approached him at a hockey game in Lithuania some time ago.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to attend the opening of the school year," the Minister said.
The Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year at a private sports school in Lithuania.
In the first classes, 115 thousand freshmen joined this year.
In total, over 850 000 children will attend primary schools and over 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, estimated by the Ministry of Education.
The new article director of the Nova news is David Fiala
Since September 1st, David Fiala has become the new director of News and Publicist Television Nova.
In his post he replaced Alan Záruba, who led the creative department of the entire Nova group since 1 June.
David Fiala previously served in the graphic department of Z1 newscasting.
For the past two years, he has been involved in the implementation of the complete visual transformation of TV news reports, Střepiny, Prask! and other publicist TV shows Nova.
David Fiala controls very well the synergies of communication between the editor, the student management and the graphic department, which is the essence of the work of the director of the news.
It has a feeling for typography and pure elegant design, which is the way we want to continue to take on in Novy's news vision," says creative director, Nova Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly submits to hackers, but naked pictures of celebrities came to the public.
Screen shot with missing files list
So far an anonymous user on 4chan publishes both naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, alerted by the American server Mashable.com.
They were reportedly accessed by unauthorized access to the User Accounts on the Apple servers, where disabled users recorded images from iPhones and iPads via automatic backup.
Apple hasn't addressed the problem yet.
Part of the celebrity rejects the images as faked, but several of the images concerned have already acknowledged their authenticity.
Among them are actress Jennifer Lawrence, famous for the title role of Katniss in the film series Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in the Death trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use acquired images and videos to enrich.
The photos were reportedly interested in American magazines, according to messages on the 4chan server but wants a hacker to prefer money from the community.
According to the server The Next Web is very likely a weakness in iClouda security.
On the GitHub server two days ago, a tool appeared which allowed to get passwords to user accounts through gross force, i.e. automatic repetition of attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool was proven to have worked, but Apple shut down the safety hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had a lot of time to gain access to different accounts prior to the publication of this instrument.
Therefore, iCloudu users should change their Apple ID password for preventive reasons.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
There are at least 12 characters in length.
The loss of celebrity naked images is a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secured many times better than computers in households or smaller companies, the shipment of sensitive photos in an unprotected form is unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up your explicit photos online or any other sensitive content, first encrypt the files before upload.
It is also reasonable to set the automatic backup of photos from your phone to run only on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
Thus, you will be able to move sensitive images in time to safety, and above all you will have the space to delete failed images, so that they will not unnecessaryly occupy the space in the online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet are offered to readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valášek in PDF format.
A smart way to save up for a college script
Since the award for a college script for many students exceeds $1 000 a year, the future student of the second year came in with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a system of loaning books from college classmates offering nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
“A book on calculations that normally costs 180 dollars, I earned a semester for ten and chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studied at the Covenant College in Georgia.
Books required in his last semester would cost $430, says.
He spent 120.
According to the university council, they spend an average student on textbooks and aids more than $1,200 a year, but students have different options to handle these expenditures.
The preferred choice of students becomes online stores and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the book for a semester, often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 booksellers on campus sites, says that the book lending has doubled since 2011.
The research in the sector shows that around a quarter of the books in university books were borrowed last spring, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are purchased according to the National Association of University Shops in University Bookshops.
Here are 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some new books may be a third lower on the Internet than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but it is available on the Internet at Chegg.com, in a bookstore specialized in textbooks, to buy a new one for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you do not mind the notes of other people or wear and wear, the learning texts used are appropriate.
At Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com he paid for the used copy of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” 42 cents.
The new guy was selling for $48.
The University Teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, proposes that students check that older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not important for working at seminars.
If so, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are a popular alternative to buying used books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Loans
It is also worth considering that if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them and you do not need them even after the seminary.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for the whole semester for about $20.
Meet the terms and conditions of the trade in which you borrow the book, including penalties for notes, highlights or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don't return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get a place of normal book e-book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "Calculus" to six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, walk around the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who soon enters Pepperdine Law School, recommends to follow ISBN because it guarantees that you buy the right book.
Before you order a book over the Internet, make sure it's really a warehouse, it advises Gault.
He's convinced on his own.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from university bookstore.
Bahna, all the mud.
And then they found rifles at the well from the end of the war
The well is right outside St. George's church.
We discovered a growth around and we began to pull out an affluent load - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the bottom of the day, we hit the barrel," Radomil Novák sketched.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found out it's a torz of attacking German rifles used by SS units.
The finding is allegedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand," added Novák.
All wooden constructions with time have broken down, which is why it is useless.
Of course, her body is preserved - holding her shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There's one explanation.
Maybe she was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of weapons used by SS units, probably out of fear of being pushed away.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They threw away guns in the woods," he thinks.
The rifle was the only thing that fans of the Duha Jeseníky movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there were many everywhere once, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully felt the mud to avoid any bad luck, but there was nothing else down there," Novák approached.
The find will end up in the museum's depository in the nearby Silesian Rudolfics.
Ukrainian General: I haven't yet set the captive Czechs free
Exclusive interview Current.cz with Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of the Russian separatists.
Kyiv/Praha - "Excuse me, I must take it... I am called from Donetsk," he apologized about eight times during an exclusive interview with News.cz Ukrainian Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise the director of the local Center for the liberation of prisoners of war.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
At any such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - which Ruban makes clear with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"It will be - go there," he concluded one of the quick discussions with Donetsk and once again he devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in advance, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests at Majdan.
Yesterday, when we agreed to talk, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the arrest of the Russian separatists takes 24 hours a day.
Now.cz: Perhaps you know that even Czechs are fighting on the side of the Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to 30.
But there may be a lot more of them.
Have you met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have freed the captured Serbs, the Dagestians, the Chechnyas, one Sweden, the Georgians... but not yet the Czechs.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captured countryman and could free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who join the Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers to capture them?
They should understand that if, as Czechs fight in Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and separatists capture them, they will shoot them after questioning without mercy, as will any other foreigner.
Separatists regard these men as mercenaries, and they do not deserve anything but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and so between them, for example, Czecha - they will put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
This guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian party acts as a state in the war.
And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say it's already exceeded a hundred men.
We've stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we just freed them... from the war if they decide to continue.
The rescuers are doctors, surgeons, but we're definitely not.
That's what it is.
And every day, they add more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be about the exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to release the prisoners, even a mere human request.
A.cz: It is heard that in a few months you have gained great authority with the Russian separatists and even trust... as well as in the Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both sides of the war?
Hard question.
One of the officers in Kiev named me "crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't insult me.
And it may even define the nature of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Officers' Corps, I've gained some authority before.
I never make up, cheat, and always hold my word.
No matter what, I'm acting honest and telling the truth.
Even if it's the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhanian government, it's very uncomfortable.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm simply telling them they're being tortured and killed.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even in exchange for prisoners, this job can mean the end to me at any time... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures do you know about?
... (long chat)... Ukrainians and Separatists are resorting to the torture of prisoners in interrogation.
I'm afraid so.
What about executions?
They only take place on the Donetsk side.
I have no information about the fact that the Ukrainian army also executes prisoners.
Nor is there any indication that the Ukrainian army is doing anything similar.
We have an idea about the amount of executions, but I can't quote the numbers, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motifs of the Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They seek independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
Separatists are fed up with oligarchs and their inconclusive opponents - to life and to death.
As we say, they ate them all the way to the throat.
The same dreams and desires people, by the way, showed in Majdan.
And now I'm going to say a little bit: Russia is supporting separatists and the West is, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be large, and the other to be small.
This is already my sentence, but there is an irreconcilable contradiction in it.
A.cz: How, for example, do you feel about one of the toughest leaders of the Russian separatists Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of war, I'm without a weapon, and I show soldiers or armed men bare hands.
And they always have me both sides of that two hundred or three hundred meters on the target or in the optical meter.
The faces of the people who are pointing at me, I always see well... and they can pull the trigger of their weapons at any time.
Expat, experienced colonel with both German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a little giant in a big Russian empire.
In any event, he talks about it all the time and considers Ukraine to be some sort of misunderstanding.
Such a state should not exist, according to him.
At the same time, it is an irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the discussion show of Ukrainian television, you called your Prime Minister Arsenij Jaceňuk a weak, helpless and tired leader who would do the best if he left quickly.
I always get at least five times the fear for that 300 meters of walk.
Why, then, should I conceal myself with the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
Maybe you know that the Ukrainians call Jacenuk "the mole."
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians who would fear or have respect and authority with others.
His behavior is directly copying the rabbit's behavior.
He may be a good economist, but as Prime Minister in the war he has no right to cry in Parliament, beg him, play with him his intrigues, threaten to lay down functions... he must drive, manage the country and protect it during the war.
At the threat of the country, the Prime Minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest on the plaice of emotions.
He's the first minister of Ukraine.
And the jaceňuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just constantly complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save sales
The previous 3 Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from the US budget and Sin City: The woman I would murder from the $70 million budget.
The Sex Tape film with Cameron Diaz earned only $14.6 million during the first weekend, as well as films for children like how to train dragon 2 was a disappointment for cinemas.
According to the article by Robbie Collin's film critic in Telegraph, children's films are guilty of their own quality.
Collin referred to 2014 as "the worst" year of children's films, and how to train dragon 2 he called a mere "functioning" continuation.
When it comes to films on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, he compared Entertainment Weekly servers CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average rating of summer film premieres at least 2,000 cinemas between the Day of War and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account audiences and film critics' views indicate that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, a change in audience access and higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix may be at fault.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's processing of the Jungle Book, said Hollywood Reporter's website: "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what's already been done.
Unlike the current Hollywood cash marketer crisis, Netflix’s profit was $1.2 billion online services, which is almost twice as much as $837 million last year.
Last summer he criticized director Steven Spielberg's studies for relying too much on comic books and foresaw a "breakdown" in Hollywood.
In the light of the current fall, some commentators claim that there may be something in his catastrophic prophecy.
With the introduction of possible major cash marketers in summer 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoň and Jurassic world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
The producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply "cyclical". For Hollywood Reporter he said: "The next summer will be the biggest cash marketers in history and no one will worry about selling."
KLDR threatens Seoul again, launched another short-range rocket
North Korea launched another short-range rocket into the sea, announced Soul.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of the common military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparing for the invasion.
The province of Čagang lies in the northwest of KDLR at the border with China.
The spokesperson of the South Korean Defense Department, according to DPA, stated that missiles were fired from the north-west of the KLDR and had reached a distance of approximately 200 kilometers.
So, for the first time, North Korea launched a missile from the province of Čagang, a South Korean media with an appeal to military circles.
The province says that there is an underground launch ramp for Scud rockets.
This is another series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea passed an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to take part in the NATO march.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as counter-summit.
Stephen Fairlough followed the situation during the weekend and talked to protesters who arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenages had to be aired from the Blue Mountains
DVA youth tourists were picked up by plane and transported to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
16-year-old girl and 18-year-old man went on a tour to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday.
When they didn't come home, the concerned relatives called the police about eight o'clock in the evening.
A search party was sent, including local police and rescue team, and a couple were found around eleven o'clock in the evening near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl hurt her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The police stayed with them overnight, and they were picked up on Monday morning.
In stable condition, they were transferred by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the win had on your leg
It was the 23-year-old forvard who could have decided on two of his biggest chances, but he failed.
After the goal was called mainly a missile close to three minutes before the end, but the place on the net ended on the goalkeeper of Opava Josef Květona.
I had it on my leg, I had to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," you put your ashes on your head.
"I guess I should've put it up under my lid, got a little high," he said.
Defenzev Sigma did not allow much of this Opava, except was Mikul's raid from 11 minutes, which however covered the goalie Reichl.
Then they started pushing the Hanans, but they didn't let them in the block defending them, and the missiles took them from a distance.
We compared for 15 minutes, then took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of a game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the chance of yours didn't change, so it ended 0-0," said Coach Hanáky Leoš Kalvodu.
Opava took the point due to the absences in the lineup, where in addition to the pair who were injured, Petr Vavřík also missed with the three-ball shooter Petr Ševčík, who hosted Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike her former politics, she did not allow them to enter.
The alternates deserve a discharge.
Sigma was more football, but up to one standard, we did not let her go," said the coach of the Slezanů Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression, and fighting.
The house is probably well deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma got four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the Josef Lébra club, which after defeat Znojměm made his million-dollar deposit into the cash register by diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébra's warning, so it can't be said that the boys didn't want to fight," Kalvod noticed, and at the address of the sleeping shooter, Vaška added: "I believe it's coming and when he scores the goal, it's going to fall.
But after the first shot, I'm going to replace him to save goals for the next match," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino double-cold Venice.
The film festival is otherwise experiencing a crisis
After a great enthusiasm for Birdman's opening film, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu, in effect, was among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, indicated that the interest in the 71st edition of the festival in Venice fell somewhat.
Whether because the number of seats in the biggest hall increased to 14 hundred or because Birdman followed critics recognised, but less attractive images for the audience as a documentary on the genocide in Indonesia of the 1960s by looking at silence and other social films from the American 99 homes to Iranian fairy tales, there were simply empty seats in the cinemas.
Comic heroes
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace did not yet put up such crowds as in the past and allegedly no longer a problem getting a last-minute spot at the hotel.
The crisis is more said than elsewhere in Italy, and it is no wonder that it has also been hit by institutions such as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself as a lack of personalities, but it is only in relation to films.
While younger fans longed for autographs of the comic superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who were successful in 99 homes with dramatic roles, for all generations no difference was the main event of visiting the legendary actor Al Pacin.
He lit up in two movies right here.
In the story of the Apparition presented outside of the competition by Oscar Barry Levison, according to Philip Roth's novel, he has the fourty-seven-year-old Pacino's role, which is close to him: an actor at the top of fame, who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as the strange owner of the hardware store from a country town in Manglehorn, made by David Gordon Green, that was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for the best acting performance shouldn't miss it - but does the artist of Pacin's format still need a price?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian one especially, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the land from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italy
After all, Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became the first picture of Birdman, rewarded with long applause, standing up.
The Calabrian branch of the mafia is viewed by the view of family relationships between the clans, which fight for power and money, and the director managed to align all the assumptions for a good movie: a quality screenplay, a camera, music and an actor.
He was also interested in the chamber psychothriller of the Hungry Heart, which shot Saverio Costanzo and Abu Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost lost her own child in his obsessive anxiety.
On the contrary, French competition films have not received a warm acceptance, nor the Redemption for glory, nor the 3rd heart, of both works sticking to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really good films, that is Birdman and the Black Soul, are not enough for the first half of the festival.
And while the festival pictures have a very depressing theme, a new film by Peter Bogdanovich called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy written in Venice outside of the competition and filmed in American style for the 40s, managed to cheer up the mood for more than one day.
Policemen caught four manufacturers of meths in Prague, carried drugs from Poland
"The detectives have arrested three men at the age of 42, 42 and 37 in recent days and a 25-year-old woman who produced and sold pervitin in Prague from last November until this August 9," said police spokesperson Jan Rösslerová.
First, on Tuesday, August 12th, the task force in Cihlářa Street caught a two-and-four-year organizer and a dealer in one person and a young woman in the group who was a buyer of drugs in Poland and a dose seller.
The following day, detectives arrested another member of the group on the basis of the prior consent of the state's attorney, a 37-year-old man.
The last of the four policemen came to the premises of the Malaysian Incinerator on Wednesday morning 20 August," the spokesperson described.
For the transport of drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide range of activities.
In the workshop of the airline area, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Konevov street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced pervitin, provided various supplies and chemicals needed to produce it and ensured the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrin from the Republic of Poland.
He further weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold the meth.
With the drug transport from Poland or the sale of drugs, he was helped by a 25 - year - old, unpunished woman.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rössler said.
CSI also carried out several house tests on drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pouch bags, syringes, hoses and other devices that can be considered as complete equipment for the manufacture of methamphetamines, based on the order of the judge.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the available records, the police discovered that the chief organizer was, in total, seven times prosecuted for the property crime since 1995, the woman was not punished," the police spokesperson added.
In 2006, the last detainees were subject to criminal conviction for sexual abuse, and the 37-year-old automechanist, who was prosecuted in freedom, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
Even for him, it was mostly a property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a criminal offence of illicit production and other handling of narcotics and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they are at risk of up to a decade's prison.
In three persons, the investigator finally gave the D.A. an instigator an instigator and an instigator for the arrest of the judge, where he eventually placed them," the spokesperson said.
The fourth accused, a 37-year-old recidivist, ended up in freedom.
His position and role in this case were not as important as the other accused.
The police continue to work with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products at a lot of "interesting" prices.
For example, in Italy, a handmade chess with a 42 x 42 cm board will serve as a good example.
If you like, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is 43 405 CZK.
The customer will obtain a set of black and red varnished figures stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fibres.
No one will be surprised to see that players have a figure of an uplifting horse in place of a classic rider.
If chess does not appear to be a sufficiently valuable gift, there is also a Ferrari 500 F2 model produced (by hand of course) in scale 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
High school and high school interference doesn't make any sense.
In addition, the Czech Republic has few generalized people and statistics show that gymnasts have a good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been great preparations in schools for the past 14 days.
Most of the time, it's routine stuff, like moving pots from the summer repository back to the classrooms and putting their wings on.
They're going to have a little bit more frmole at the magnesium school.
A few days before the start of the season, they find furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature for the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, a four-year high school in Horice after three years, opening and renewing its activities.
Not on the public, but on the private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that founders would be so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by the introduction into the register of schools managed by the Ministry of Education.
"The French socialists should shut up and make France right," says Francoise Holland's key ally.
Valls calls on a heavily fragmented leftist to "show her support" to a combative socialist president whose new division of functions did not meet the agreement of the majority of French.
The President deserves universal respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
“Our duty is to stay by his side,” he said and gathered the applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour working week, despite the passionate guess of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Finance, who proposed that the rules be released at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to stay "cohesive" with the government.
Christian Taubir, the Justice Minister, but she made a budget line for him when she appeared at a meeting of rebel socialist Members, where the Socialist Party criticized her for her "The French lost faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, the leader of an extremely conservative right, laughed at the constant internal dispute between the socialists when she declared that she did not assume that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls is also forced to build a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new will not last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen said to her supporters.
It reiterated its call for dissolution of Parliament and stated that it was convinced that a party might win the early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in March municipal elections and in May extremely conservative right succeeded in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a public opinion survey of Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of the French think that the Socialist Party is at risk of split into several competing factions before the end of Holland's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon be patient if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation might get worse.
The gambling and street art of Prague is no longer limited to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved until the new management of the capital.
The streets of Prague do not disappear from the streets of Prague in front of municipal elections of other games and the city will not restrict street art.
The dog walk will not even be restricted.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in October elections.
"In addition, the decision on changes should not be made by the current city leadership, which ends in a few weeks' term," said Councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several city halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel gambling on their territory.
The games won't disappear, the gambling decree won't change yet.
It's a task of new city leadership after elections.
We would not be able to do this in technical terms, for example, given the time limits for comments and so on," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which had to be approved by the Decree, would take place on 11 September.
A referendum on a gambling ban will be prepared on the day of municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
There is currently a ban on gambling, for example in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not be changed even in the case of street art, the so-called busting.
In particular, Prague 1, which has already sent the Magistrate a draft of places that the current list of prohibited places would like to extend.
Musicians also don't want Prague 5 in the area of Angel.
The decree regulating the field of dogs the city is planning for a few months, not yet completed.
The location of the heren and the issue of the buzzing solves city decrees.
It can only be issued or modified by the City Council.
The town halls only have an advisory vote, they can't issue their own decrees.
Last week, he placed his victory at the hands of the proponents of Scottish independence
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake for the third time when it almost placed billboards all over Scotland the question of whether they wanted to be rich.
But you don't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet or getting their respect when you start threatening them.
The morals of the New Testament are still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scotsmen have a much greater tendency to banish exchangers from the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and that is why he repeatedly questioned his opponent, Unionist Darling, whether he is willing to respect "the sovereign will of the Scottish people", if the Scottish voters would vote for independence and start supporting the single currency for Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to vote between Scottish civil society and London financials, and with Grimasa he fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling won't support the Scottish voters' mandate.
However, the discussion about Scotland’s currency has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and the defence of state health services, which citizens have for free.
Darling in the matter of currency supported the London banker and also made the impression that he would not protest against the privatisation of health care.
As Salmond said, "he went into bed with conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish voter knows the Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to the voters in Scotland, but to the association of "bosses", to the Confederation of the British industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly, absent house.
The Scotsmen would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be "a successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, causing him almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots aren't supposed to jump out and they have to accept what they are.

The Pessimistic Start of School by Milos Urban
Illustrations to Story The longest year
Miloš Urban The longest year
The rest of the holiday was the best, the last week of the day, and we just laid around and we laid around with Grandma's summer, the silence before the storm, the peace of mind before the stress.
New clothes when you can get from Tuzex, the boots from East Germany.
Reading Fast arrows, already fallen, mowing on the wheel through the mountain around Imperial to the back behind the Vary, somewhere on the tennis courts, was no longer hot, the sun stroked its back and shoulders, knocked the rays on the farewell.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still a vacation mode, sleep until 7:30, it'll be worse in a week, the moments before falling asleep they stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then wake up at 7:30 in the morning.
He'll be here Monday.
Most of the time, it's not raining, on the contrary, summers are misguided in front of school.
Clamping in a ghostly light on a navel and feeling like a plastic figure in a glass pedestal, there's that school, ZDZT A.
Pototic with a giant pink plaster, and in front of it the old familiar faces as well as some new ones, the boys pulled out, the girls breastsier.
There are bastards, avoid them, and it's still interesting how infallibly they stick together and how they're early.
And these grown-up-looking girls who have come out screaming, they're laughing, they're probably having a change in their lives over the holidays, while everything's over the old days with me.
And new freshmen, some of them nervous and some of them excited, why are they even coming up here?
Because he has to, he has to, he has to be trained by the military.
So inside, cool humidity floors and a light smell of disinfectant, poisoned schoolboy with a mop, unfortunately still the same one that says the student lends the key to the tin box, where they can leave the textbooks and which is still so few.
For a bottle.
The smell of the wardrobe remains in mind, it's not happening now, it's pretty airtight, but it's gonna be worse in a week.
It's all about the idea that the stomach's closing and it's starting to hurt.
A head that's even worse to think of math, the devil's game for the chosen ones that I don't belong to, and I'll never be.
Again, the threes and fours, the fives, hide from testing, fit into the bench and best sublime, be there even without being, exist only as a name in the classroom, and dream of stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas into space, where nobody competes with anyone, humiliates anyone, and does not break anyone's leg.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now like years ago.
She left her daughter born to die.
She is threatened with a special punishment - News.cz
The first birth occurred in March 2012 at the public toilet at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any help, she was born a little girl who, after cutting her navel, packed her into the ready blanket, hid under the jacket and took her to the road transporter, where she put her in the bushes located several dozen meters away from the road.
She was born on her way to school.
It came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I had a need to go to the bathroom on the bus. That's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors I wore to school," she described the defendant and said she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The following day, she returned to the place, put the body of the child in a backpack, took the body out of the backpack, packed in a black plastic bag and hid and left under the stairs in her grandmother's house in Havlicko Brod," she was sued that it was not entirely clear when the newborn died.
It could have been in tens of minutes, but also hours after birth, suffocation in a blanket or under the jacket, hypothermia, or bleeding out of an unbound navel.
The same scenario was repeated in spring next year.
The woman, at an undetected time from February 12th, when the baby’s corpse was found by random witnesses under the bush at the pond in Havlíčkobrodsk, she had her own baby.
This time, in the bathroom of a submarine apartment in a family house.
Without verifying whether it was born alive, without cutting or tieing the navel, which was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic cases, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner took him to the pond.
She was finally turned in by a friend.
The father of both children was just a friend of the defendant, who allegedly didn't know about her partner's pregnancy.
For this reason he does not stand trial now, but has been punished for the infringement of the Act on Funerals.
He was also the one who turned to the police later.
I don't like the fact that he's not punished as an accessory.
He manipulated the child against my wish.
I know my solution wasn't right, but it seemed human at the time," the defendant's indignation was not concealed by the indignation, which allegedly was subject to a man's relationship and was afraid of him.
During her statement, a young woman was quite balanced.
Her eyes were filled with tears until she spoke of a relationship with her parents, from whom she left her own years of age.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They visit me every 14 days, do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried.
I didn't get the equipment because I didn't want the kids, I felt young.
I still wanted to put him in the babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I can't explain that to you," the judge replied.
However, she refused to deal with the thought and intention of killing the newborn.
The other child was also born dead, according to her claim.
Even in pregnancy, she continued drinking alcohol.
But I've limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also restricted smoking," she said.
Although pregnancy was seen on both occasions, everyone also claimed that she was having a health problem that was flooded.
And that, my friend.
The main trial will continue at the castle court on Tuesday with statements from the court experts.
On Wednesday, a judgment could already be given.
A woman is threatened by a penalty rate of up to 18 years in prison, possibly an exceptional punishment.

Pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong are provoking Chinese authorities the day after the vote decision.
There was a group of people loyal to Beijing who waved the Chinese flag.
The Standing Commission of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two out of three candidates participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first receive support from the appointment committee, which is likely to be composed of members of the faithful Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the election tickets and force pro-democratic activists to restore their promise and paralyze Hong Kong's financial center of protests by the 'Central occupation' movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tension, China’s leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will be extended to other cities.
After Beijing published in June a detailed report setting out the Chinese official authority in Hong Kong, democratic activists organised an unofficial referendum on elections in the Special Administrative District and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference, held by Prime Minister Li, is organised by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the legal committee Zhang Ronghsun and the Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei were also to speak at several press conferences.
The student activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government office this afternoon.
Within the last few days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on “state sovereignty”
According to the Russian newspaper's description of events, Russian President Vladimír Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting the Separatists in the east of the country on Sunday and to immediately begin negotiations on the “state sovereignty” of the removed areas.
His spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin had no intention of suggesting that the region of Eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated in order for the Russian speaking region to be given the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Government of Kiev to deal with the pro-Russian insurgents as equal, corresponds to a clear strategy that follows the outbreak of riots five months ago: Help the Separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novorus real independence so that instead of the West it can join Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of state television Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern region of Donetsk and Luhansk, which the Separatists ruled in March and April after Moscow was ascribed on 18 March by the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine.
The Kremlin and separatists of the recently occupied territory referred to as "Novorus" or "New Russia", a term referring to the famous pre-revolutional days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass has published Putin's words that everyone who believes that peace talks are on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians launched the campaign before the parliamentary elections on October 26, while government forces attack the civilian population in the areas controlled by separatists.
"In the interest of the people living in these areas, we must immediately initiate meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the Statute of State sovereignty in the south-east of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's insinuation of state sovereignty was thought in the context of wider autonomy, which has been dealing with the leadership of Kiev for several months and which is to mitigate the concerns of Russian speaking areas from the threat to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that the necessary autonomy can only be granted by the Ukrainian Government to the Eastern Region.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it is an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Kremlin spokesperson, who was supposed to correct Putin's "incorrect interpretation" has highlighted Russia's leadership's approach to tackling the East's separatists' rebellion, which is different from that of Crimea's open occupation, where most of the two-million-dollar population is originally numbered to the ethnic Russians.
Moscow should also add much more difficulty to the annexation of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and public opinion surveys that took place before the conflict have shown widespread support for the continuation of Ukraine.
The autonomy of Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments of Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, thus essentially giving the Kremlin a real control over the territory that would link the Russian land to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the headquarters of the main Russian naval fleet, the maritime commercial base and the historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russian Rostov and Crimea are also the centers of the mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
During his inaugural speech of June 7, Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - proposed that Ukrainian legislators consider changes in the constitution that would give more control over their finance and language status.
But this vision of autonomy is very different from the vision of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of armament and incitement violence.
Putin's last challenge that Kiev should treat separatists as equal to one another following the next procedure of insurgents last week after Russian troops and tanks from an earlier peaceful area along the Azov Sea penetrated Eastern Ukraine.
The Russian strengthened separatists have taken control of Novoazovsk by such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign with the aim of occupying strategic coastal territory until Crimea.
This has succeeded in a huge civilian and military effort to strengthen Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500 000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and a narrow entrance gate to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday he performed at the meeting of the leading representatives of the European Union in Brussels and encouraged an action that would prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," said Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive action - the leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecific escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday to reporters in Kiev, said that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovakia after last week two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Donetsk region to support clothed separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovakia during the Russian invasion was exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airshipmen captured in Ukraine last week, Lysenko said.
In the scandal with exposed photos, Australian celebrities and Gabi Greece are also involved
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his dissatisfaction with hackers, who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Greeko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is shocked by the fact that in the biggest scandal with hacked celebrity photos, she got an Internet series of explicit photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims to have 60 pictures of the naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, the singer Rihanna, Ariany Grande and Ley Michell and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Personal images of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Greece were reportedly made public because of the leak from iCloud.
There's 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who applied to Greece last month, said the Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting. ”
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
According to online news reporters, Greece, who is now in New York, has reported that hacking is "unstuck" and those who have become its target are "feel humiliated".
It's believed that the hacker took thirty photos of Palmer with a former friend of Scott Speedman, including two shots on top of the pool.
Palmer performed, for example, in the film Love and Honor, where she was her counterpart Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the TV star Chuck Strahovski and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning didn't comment on the stolen pictures yesterday.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said: "This is a clear violation of privacy."
The actor Seth Rogen has criticised on his Twitter: “Published photos of hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods. ”
In legal terms, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The footballers of Sigma made up for Lébra, even without winning
Olomouc - Thunders and lightnings, which co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent down on his subordinates last week, are, seems, past.
Although they brought from Opava only a point for a handless draw.
The club bosses got a little worked up by the deployment and the fighting.
Payday money could come to the club soon.
"I'm going to leave one more game, as I talked about it last week, but I'm much more optimistic," confirmed Lez, that despite not winning Sigma, he was convinced by better performances.
The fighting and deployment we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I want to see from players.
In that case, I am able to forgive that he will not win.
If we'd played this game since the beginning of the season, I'm convinced we haven't lost yet," she thinks.
Sigma in Opava stopped the introductory pressure of the domestics, then settled the game and the second half was already better.
After the victory of Kalvod, the trustees touched, but they failed to reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result isn't according to our ideas.
However, we lacked the satisfaction of only one changed chance," said Lez, who does not think that the change in the approach of footballers caused only his threats.
I'm sure there were more aspects.
Whether by my side, by coach or by fans," said Lebre.
Sigma has to count on pressure.
After the match in Opava last week, the players didn't want much comment.
I'm trying to put these things all away.
I tried not to admit it," Michal Reichl, a young goalie, turned his head.
Without comment, he left a question about Lébrov's statement from last week, the attacker Václav Vašček, who did not turn Sigma's biggest opportunity into a Saturday match.
But then he talked a little bit about pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everyone wants to get on with us.
Today we have shown that if we fight and drive everybody's ass, we can," he said.
The warnings were taken to heart
Even Coach Leoš Kalvoda did not deny that the preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was obvious that Mr. Lébra's warnings were taken to heart.
Even though it wasn't about not wanting to fight and blowing it off before," said the Olomouc coach.
It was similar to the first 15 minutes today.
It took us to deal with hardness and realize what the second league was about.
That it wasn't just about football, it was about fighting," Kalvoda said.
There's no hope that Sigma's going to work from the start in the next game.
"I would love to believe it," he added.
