Inflation in Europe has jumped for food
Accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to a constant rise in food prices.
The price increase in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 percent in October, annual inflation of 3.1 percent was registered, announced by the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union.
The official forecast was estimated to be only 3 percent, as reported by Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian Emission Banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate, with the result that the reduction, together with rising raw materials prices and falling unemployment, would lead to inflation spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain inflation rates below two percent, but close to them.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must "dissuade" inflation from doing anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation is 3.3 percent of the 15-year-old record; in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Eurozone inflation has died out due to rising food and energy prices.
The wheat term prices have increased by 88 percent, also the soy rate has reached its highest since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and milk products.
The price of oil on world markets this year rose by 52 percent and last month it had already cost one barrel of black gold almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 percent this year to 2.5, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the level of 12 months of inflation will remain approximately 3 percent in the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to double its interest rates in 2008.
Gallup sees the government crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement has increased significantly after the long-term stagnation to the beginning of December, and has now had the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Socialists Gallup Institute, 13% of the support has never been measured.
In the case of certain voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the voters of the opposition - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) of the aid compared to the fifth support of the MFA.
MDF and SZDZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ are two percent of the total population, according to a survey under the threshold for entry to Parliament.
Among certain voters of the party, there is one percent more in favour of both camps.
The public's view on the economy has also deteriorated due to the previous minimum - never has the ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad, so high - 41 percent, while according to the other 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
The families assess the change in their material situation after the spring and summer prospects now again more pessimistic.
As far as next year is concerned, more of the population with further deterioration and only a tenth with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of the respondents were judged, most of all the current surveys of the Gallupa Institute, that the Prime Minister was doing his work rather badly than well.
Ferencia trusts Gyurcsany or very trusts 13 percent of those questioned, while Viktor Orbán has a 38 percent share of supporters.
The Prime Minister doesn't trust 54 percent, the chairman of the Fidesz 27 percent movement.
One of the indicators for the development of the political situation is how much part of the public thinks that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without changing the government.
While the government and the Prime Minister considered it desirable 35 per cent after last October’s unrest, this share is now only 20 per cent, with the relative majority (33 per cent) of the solution only in the release of the new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, it is evident that 60 percent of the respondents replied to the question concerning their possible participation, that the referendum would certainly come and that another 20 percent would probably come.
For comparison, "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly only take part 55 percent and the other 15 percent consider their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be unquestionable on the basis of the current intentions.
The school would say no 74, fees for doctors 79 and fees for hospital stays 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the area of people who certainly promise their participation, then the introduction of a tuition fee, doctor fees and hospital charges would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost five o'clock it hit Tesco
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörs business triangle maintained last year, on average 16% of the price level, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of the Napi Gazdaság daily in the Budaörsian trade triangle this year increased by 16 percent on average, but in all hypermarkets there was an increase of over a thousand forints in price.
Since prices in the food supermarkets have "off" left last December, percentages have not been so drastic due to the previous high base.
However, it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that what they could buy under 9,000 forints last year will not now be given for ten thousand.
The consumption basket of the Daily Economy in studied hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest basket price was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003 there was a consumable basket of 6 800 forints.)
The Unica price and the live fish remained almost at last year's level, but they greatly undermined the cruel breasts, nuts, and poppy.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to those of the Central Statistical Office, although we found a pound bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
Competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of a two-litre Coca Coly bottle was below 200 forints, so there was also a backup product of only 257 forints.
This year, however, he appeared according to Napi Gazdaság Auchan's consumer basket as the most expensive, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our calculations, she raised prices in the consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság due to prices at Christmas Cora by 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased by approximately 18 percent.
In comparison to last year's highest and this year's lowest consumer basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest is 21 percent.
In forintech the increase was on average 1 480.
The average price increase last year was 1 206 forints, with prices having been influenced by VAT growth last year at Christmas.
It is precisely this process of trade that has been disrupted, trade houses have clearly not been able to decide how much price margins are to be set for individual products, as they have not been able to predict the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of the product in question incorrectly, the price margin adjusted for the intensity of circulation may lose significant profit.)
Due to VAT, last year the price increase in the consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság showed so extremely that the price of the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than in 2006, while at the cheapest price difference of all 844 forints.
This year, the extreme difference did not occur, the most expensive basket now stood by 1 630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest one to raise by 1 284 forints.
In comparison to both Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase appeared, and in less than 20 months, the daily consumption in hypermarkets has been undermined by more than 30 percent.
(This, inter alia, does not fully confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months in the case of several basic foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
However, in the latter case, according to the consumer basket of the Day economy, it seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, which is quite expensive in last year, showed price growth in the face of both the basic and the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to have taken a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they managed to enforce a drastic increase in prices in international chains as well.
Hypermarkets in a gold triangle do not complain, still report on a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in three visited shops are no longer interested in prices.
They're buying everything, they're buying a quantum, they're taking durable food after pay.
On Wednesday morning, in all three supermarkets there were long fronts at the registers, as the number of visitors increased rapidly.
However, as we know, rural turnover is lower, many international chains complain to research firms that sales fall behind their plans, not only in the case of food but also durable consumer goods.
In many places they are saved in disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection were registered in hospitals due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overburdening of the personnel of the disease stopage do not help, says the prime minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places they also save themselves in disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection has been diagnosed at St. John's trauma department.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who got to the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
Similar infections occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after that he had to return with MRSA infection and due to the bacteria found in his body so far could not be performed one major operation.
By this December, 1 094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistent pathogens of the disease were reported to the Nesocomialis Survey National System, and Karolina Böröczová, the prime minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistent pathogens have been registered in hospitals with certainty, others are unknown.
Almost two-thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacil, a resistant golden staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carry a third of the people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cervix inflammation, tonsilitis, skin infection, morning infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered excessively or inappropriately, they develop from a bacteria that responds well to bacteria antibiotics that are very resistant to antibiotics and which are rapidly spreading in inadequate hospital conditions.
In the case of transient or persistently poor immune system in patients with impaired body weight, low weight, or in patients of age, it may cause serious hospital infections such as early infection or blood poisoning - Sepsis.
According to St. John's hospital chief physician, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections are part of daily practice in hospitals.
"Infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of pathogens is not investigated."
It resists antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, care professionals are treated in rubber gloves and mask and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined whether MRSA is present in their system, but even so the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be avoided, but current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not favourable to prevent the emergence and spread of multi-resistent pathogens, says Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection occurs symptomatically in hospitals and senior homes, hospitals admitted should check and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this examination.
Most of the cases are thus revealed if the patient suffers from an appreciable MRSA infection, said the prime minister of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, or a microbiological examination should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but the hospital does not comply with it in all cases.
The collection of microbiological samples is even more rare in the basic and outpatient treatment of patients, as told by Karolina Böröczová.
Stored on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is distributed among patients most frequently through medical personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, but there are serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by cape infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under the conditions of home hospitals.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres away.
As Karolina Böröczová noted, unfortunately, we can also meet up with a lot in hospitals that are in an adverse material situation, saving in disinfectants, and patients, which still increases the chances of developing infections.
According to Karolina Böröczová, where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are shown to be less or further spreads of the disease can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents a huge amount of spending for health insurance companies, which is why it fights everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has written an MRSA prevention programme and a reduction in its presence.
The programme seems to be successful, according to published data, show a declining trend in MRSA infection in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks the prevention of multi-resistent pathogens (including MRSA), and hospital infections caused by these pathogens, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused a fatal accident wasn't drunk.
The official expert report on the Police Captain XXII, which caused a fatal accident, is complete.
It can be ruled out that police captain XXII of the District, who killed pedestrians on Tuesday and who had retired from his duties, would inform the spokesperson of the Chief State Department of Attila Morvai on Friday after the expert opinion of this case was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation, which had already stated that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before sitting behind the wheel.
The then director of the XXII Police Directorate knocked down Lajos Kossutha Street in XXII on Tuesday in the district of his own passenger car when the five-year-old man who entered the road crossing outside the marked crossing.
(The latter fact that the pedestrian passed outside of the zebra, in fact according to the road traffic rules, is not an easy situation, the rolling car must also give priority.)
After transporting to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these events, the District Police Director resigned from office and applied for a transfer to service, as reported by the police because he was so shaken by the case.
In the case, the Budapest Investigation Office is investigating.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain from the outset had been working with state officials conducting investigations.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks totalling EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed by the Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects implemented under the support of the Coal Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, with the parties already concluding a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, now the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The credit agreement of EUR 150 million is also used for the budgetary financing of projects linked to education.
The EIB has approved EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose overall, and the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which the budget will mainly apply to the research and development project of the Debrecian University.
There was also talk at the meeting about the 4th metro route.
The Parties agree that, once Hungary has agreed on the details of the financing of the subway with the EU, it will return to whether and how the original agreement should be modified.
According to János Veres, this can happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary, with a total of 113 projects.
The interest of the loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment fee shall be bound by the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is overwhelming - the attention of Europe as a whole is turning towards a little neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys on the ever cheaper yet, but fast-growing EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European objective of real estate purchases is no doubt Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and seafront houses.
From the mountains are the most in the region of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albana, Golden sands, sunny coasts, ancient cities of Sozopol and Nessebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balčik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, investors and central parts of the country will be interested sooner or later - for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more interested in buying also in the area of Russia’s cheap city.
The capital of Sofia is also a promise of tempting possibilities, business and office premises promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best road to turn into one of Europe’s most attractive golf paradises, and so it will be next to the summer and winter seasons sought for the destination in the next two seasons.
Predicted investors are already buying in a large way, for example in the vicinity of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and lifestyles at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and more often also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cyprus investors, Black Sea and there are traditionally many Russian customers in ski havens.
Foreign merchant climb split into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Renovating people buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros or lost old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renew.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities; it is important for them to be close to the big city, shops and usually a local doctor.
The second category is chat buyers (Bulgaria became one of the first 10 German holiday goals in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who purchase in the hope of a rise in value in the medium or long term.
Real estate in the capital is continuous, as demand is getting stronger.
In Bulgaria, the lowest real estate prices in the European Union are, but they have grown by 21 percent annually over the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices is far above wage growth.
Hydrodor and Hungarian 6 percent
According to information from the Minister for the Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodore, an expert meeting will be concluded on Tuesday, and after the Wednesday official start, the international conference on the climate regime will continue after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are talking about the Bali Travel Map, which deals with the efforts following the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force by 2012.
At the moment, they are being debated by a stormy debate between developing and advanced countries.
The United States has also announced that they do not want to talk about precise numbers now, although they are inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 in the light of 1990.
The next big question of the conference is whether advanced countries will also proceed, in addition to reducing emissions, to provide both material and technological assistance to the countries that are referred to it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, set up by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member management board, probably within the framework of the UN World Environment Programme (GEF) - we can read in Piac és Profit.
Hungary's 6 percent
The Minister for the Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodore, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in global climate protection efforts and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, irrespective of the success of the adoption of the "agreements after 2012" and is ready to commit to up to a 30% reduction in the event that other developed world areas, respectively, are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments corresponding to their capabilities.
Gábor Fodore pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had an objective of a reduction of 5.2 per cent, with the then 15 EU Member States committed to 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which will be fulfilled by our country. - It is recalled in the Ministry's press release.
It is a great deal for Bali, because an international agreement on long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would not have moved until 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce the emission reduction provided for by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed up by a new emissions reduction system, the need for which the international UN scientific group dealing with climate change - IPCC, which is the Nobel Peace Prize holder, has also pointed out in its latest report.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British army is recruiting on YouTube
British military forces publish on the server for sharing videos from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, which they popularize themselves.
First YouTube liked the British Air Force (RAF): Special Forces operating in Afghanistan here since March 2006 have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban, announced by the BBC.
Recordings, made with a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Command by a combat operation in the area of Kandahar and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
More than 75,000 people have already looked at the Internet in this form.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peace forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original intention for recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defence, they are also good to familiarize the general public with the real goal of the presence of the army abroad.
"Promotion published in this form compared to traditional television recruitment advertising almost nothing," said the BBC Defence Expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it also necessarily carries a certain political message in it, because it specifically confirms the rightfulness of the military actions that the government has decided on."
The Americans made the game
The army is concerned that besides carefully tuned, censored recordings, amateur videos, including the death of soldiers, get to the server: in a little hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers talk about losses, but not a bloody form of combat.
After all, many of the videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during the intense deployment, have already come up with the British army.
The Americans are recruiting a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can through a more or less loyal simulation get directly into the skin of the soldiers.
At the Ministry there'll be Christmas with raffle and paws
Mónika Lamperth's work apparently is not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, he will hold a final work meeting for his colleagues, where he will say good-bye to the pack and coffee.
At some ministries, the celebration with live music will be a raffle and toast to the officials of Christmas.
A party, a Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - so they enjoy the power.
The state authorities are preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive minister's Christmas party this year will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but she is not expected by her staff.
At the Christmas of orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, during the Missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers serving on foreign missions, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort is dedicated to the atmosphere of the end of 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be fired from the hooves against the other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4 320,000 forints, and of the six hundred employees of the Ministry is expected to be approximately three hundred and fifty guests.
The resort will hold on to its Christmas traditions, but it will also take place at various performances and will also draw raffola.
NFÜ Christmas cost 4 700 000 Forints and took place on Wednesday in the State Justice Council (OIT) building - there were concerts and dinners on the program.
The rental room cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
One of the NFÜ departments seems to be invited to another Christmas celebration: there will be a tensile company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG) from EU money.
To this end, they rented a building of the Vegszínház Theatre.
MAG a. s. failed to confirm this information as we failed to find the person concerned.
No clothes needed
The OIT building was not only hosted by NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which was held on 7 December by St.
But the OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party began by the health minister, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball were not compulsory evening dress or suit at all.
The Puritan parties are going to be prepared by the Departments of Health, Labour and Local Government.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and celebration for staff for 400 000 forints in its own building.
Minister of Work Mónika Lamperth's co-workers are not even officially invited to the Christmas party, but to the final meeting.
A hundred and eighty guests are counted, who, according to the press release, only get coffee and paws, so only 350 000 forints will be available for the party.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply drink in the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development ale.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting at which 436 workers are expected in their own large hall.
At the Christmas party 2,500 forints per guest - total amount includes reception with Swedish tables and toasts.
Since Minister János Veres, the PM Christmas workers have been celebrating in a similar way every year.
The atmosphere of the party will, however, be lacking, the officiality will strengthen not only the ministerial expression but also the afternoon time of the event.
The farm resort organizes a New Year's reception on 20 January, the Minister's Christmas is not taking place.
The reception will take place at the Vajdahunyadvár castle in town orchards, and 1,000 forints per person are set for a hundred guests by the Ministry.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only the foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short health minister and end with a small hospitality.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture of Christmas parties are not held at all, has communicated the [origo] portal to the relevant press department.
The award of Christmas celebrations of the Ministry of the Environment in the press department were not able to communicate.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party at the Umělečkoprůmysl Museum.
Consisting to a giant strike
The League Union Association, and the National Union of Workers' Councils (MOS) will set up their strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's unlimited strike.
A protest public meeting will be held on Saturday - the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - the work will be stopped.
The event will certainly cause serious traffic interruptions, as rail transport will almost completely stop and the employees of the Budapest Transport Undertaking (BKV) will also strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League and the National Union of Workers' Councils will meet with details jointly organized Monday strike.
The LIGA – MOST strike committee will also be established, which will coordinate Monday's event.
On Saturday, a protest public meeting is held, and from Monday the union joining the strike will stop the job for an indeterminate period of time if there is no agreement with the government.
This means that there was no deadline for the termination of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament did not adopt the Health Insurance Act in the end, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the legislation is voted out, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to the Parliament meeting on Monday’s agenda, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted on until late evening or night hours.
Due to Monday’s initial strike it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: the work will be stopped on the railway for an indeterminate period, the part of Budapest’s mass transport and more than half of Volán can be stopped in the morning.
At the same time, half of the roadway will also be closed in many places of the country.
The challenge to the strike was joined by numerous trade unions and civil society, whose list is constantly updated on the website of the League.
Some organizations have been advising a strike for an indeterminate period of time, others have declared temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, Hungary’s State Railways (MAV) and the Independent Union of Railway Workers (WSZSZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, with more and more people travelling on the railway at the beginning of Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, BKV will strike from the start of operation within 13 hours, from 7 am to 9 pm at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organised by the LIGA Workers' Union of the Energy Industry, to a 2-, respectively a 2-, and a 2-hour employment stop from the Department of Teachers and a Democrat Union of Teachers.
The Union of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Union of Workers in Health and Social Affairs (EDSZ), which belongs to the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and submits a new concept to the public.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions applicable from next year should be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, in order to ensure that early retirement for the relevant work fields is provided with the possibility of being included in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the event is that the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) falling under the League trade union does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economics and Transport concerning railway branches, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungary’s guard has increased the country’s risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with support of the Jobbik Magyarszegért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of the Political Capital Institute, increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole area in a few respects.
The company's "attention of risk" writes: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "violent ethnic tensions between the Roma and the non-Roma population of Hungary may already occur in the short term".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy is likely to lead to such an action - adds the research institute.
All of this can be explained by one of the largest negligences of Hungarian political leaders: "the public debate on the Roma issue has left public representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could oppose the Roma-Hungarian political strategy."
This deepens the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - judges the institute.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media, "to a large extent, the image of Hungary has ruined abroad, especially as regards faith in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-rights groups, which have been getting more and more publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, is that since the summer of 2007, several organizations have been created, themselves called "national defences".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil society, while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defence tasks (in the case of living disasters, invasion of their country, disturbance of order), in addition with a statement on the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
It also notes: This is all happening in a way that tries to wrap up a variety of political efforts built on the resistance of society to politics and parties to civilian clothing.
It is therefore not only in the case of such groups to emphasise civilization and form of association that is not only a matter of avoiding legal disciplines of judicial registration, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor in neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian City has pointed out that in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, the ultra-nationalist political leaders of some of the neighbouring countries want to excuse their own anti-Hungary policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this can affect the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so the political risks to the area as a whole have increased.
According to the Hungarian Guard, the activity is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the Ultrasonic National Union of Bulgaria (BNU).
On the background of the formation of the Bulgarian guard there is mass Roma riots which have erupted in one of the Sofian districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used a guard to set up a guard, with the aim of the organization being "national defence".
In the last 17 years, she said that there was a "Cypsian Terror" in Bulgaria, but that the state remained inactive and indifferent, reminding the Institute of Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative has triggered a stormy debate with the Bulgarian public.
In addition, an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will create their own city as a sign of resistance.
Since the current activity of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities with the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even the Hungarian Roma will respond to a threat in a similar way by establishing their own homeowner, we can read in the risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of the Political Capital Institute, said to the press office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analyses are published every year and if they find anything that might affect the risk change, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The holidays are not open everywhere
In Hungary, the days of leave are laid down precisely by law and it has become a general practice that working days are moving around during the holidays, which is expected to happen less times next year.
In the European Union and America, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and working days.
Days of rest are usually related to church holidays or significant historical events.
We also celebrate New Year in our country: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is the day off - to New Year so that people can rest after New Year's Eve.
In the course of the year we have 11 free holidays in total.
The national festival is the 15th March celebrating revolution from 1848 and 23 October, the Memorial Day of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the state, May 1st work, November 1st and 2nd we remember the dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two days of Easter, Lettuce and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays, according to the calendar, rarely seem to be for the weekend, it has become a practice to move a working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after a holiday.
However, the price for extended weekends is that before Saturdays we stay at the workplace and school.
The day that precedes or follows the holiday will be worked out, for years, in a special decree by the Minister of Labour.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and their employed workers, to public employees and public servants.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions which are in operation without interruption or in view of their purpose, even in the days of business peace.
This year, the work order will be changed only around the end of the year: from December 24, life will almost stop in the country, because, according to previous experiences, most people will "work" or use their saved holiday in advance between Christmas and New Year's Eve.
In the next year, several of our holidays fall right into the middle, respectively at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around the work day, so that the workers can stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, 26 April will be a working day in order to be the opposite Friday, 2 May of the day of rest.
Next move is related to the holiday October 23: on Saturday, October 18 will work instead of Friday 24.
However, next year's end will be able to take place completely on the sign of holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost nonstop holidays everywhere, even though New Year's Eve is on Wednesday.
Six horrifying little things you can make your colleagues angry
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, innocent lies that we will almost never notice: all of them "save" everyday days at the workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these little unpleasant things, or put on gloves and vague situations that can make others angry, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague told you.
That you've missed a meeting for this?
In a better case, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or he'll call the marketing department and say he forgot to pass the message (this is less common solution).
The most common thing is a matter solved once by an apology.
It is good to think about how you can prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues, knowingly trying to avoid them.
Do you borrow anything that isn't yours?
There's nothing more uncomfortable than stretching out for a piece of paper, office supplies, or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on your desk yesterday, but he's gone by morning?
Or did you find your pen on the table that you thought was lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they'll be right to be angry at you that you're messing with things.
Do not remove envelopes or adhesive paper from your office because it may be uncomfortable when you are out of time, and you will need them immediately.
The gossip about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the doorknobs.
Who, who, what was he doing with?
Where and why?
Don't put your messages (housewives) on everyone's nose about the private life of your colleagues!
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, don't abuse his trust!
Lock up what you have heard, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know about his things.
You report your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report your absence of strong headaches because you are not well, or you think that you would rather rest today, thinking that your work, the urgent tasks and work that have a specific term will have to be done for you by someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day or that something may happen that will make you stay at home, report it so that your colleagues and leaders will not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Abuse, Hyaning, Telephone
So, you've gone to work, which is where you're going to be grossly taken out by a dyin' colleague?
Did you accidentally witness a phone conversation that would be better not to hear?
Do not interrupt your colleagues by gloating, singing, by loud call (going above your head), nor by assing, by constant bowing, by loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be disturbing even if they are not being taken into a project (written, planning, organization).
Are you accusing others of making mistakes?
If something is not in time or if you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Do not refer to any chaos in the office and the noisy colleagues!
Recognize if you've been wrong and someone has paid and repair the damage!
Ask how you could put things right, fix negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Tetanus and parrots: comfortable clothes at home, of course not fit in the office!
Do not wear clothes for leisure, even if your profession permits it!
Don't be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in regular clothes - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegantly!
When a person wants to fit, he stops being interesting.
Connecting in the usual morning traffic.
A special melody will be heard from the radio: the sound of violins to which electronic effects are connected.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes pace and bass is added to the previous tone, then a female congregation joins as a real jewel.
The song of the band Zagar, called Wings of Love, is at the m2 station.
Our home musical life hasn't been able to spoil us with high-quality electronic pop.
All of a sudden, the traffic looks pretty different because you're just listening to the new Zagar album.
The Yonderboie apparition, a few new and interesting productions from the home digital underground, slowly alters the overall image, and although it is again in the fashion of the garage rock with its beating into the guitar, even the home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the 5th and he also played in Yonderboi's band until the end - perhaps because two duds did not fit into one bar - he went his own way.
However, with his (Zagar) project and music, which combines jazz elements, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to strike only when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ference Töröka film "The Season").
Its formations, playing in the beginnings of smaller clubs, recognized the wider audience after their first album of 2002 included their first album of the 50 most important home records and declared Zagar in Yonderboie as almost the only domestic developer determining developments that could also be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt "in the course", although no one asked them, of course, if they are satisfied with this sticker.
The band reacted as it should: she made a new, better album.
Now released an album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths to them, although the name itself tries to create a follow-up with the initial flights in the Five-Castle.
It is one verse from the composition of the old band Baláz Zságer.
A reference to the essentials, flying would be in place, but beside the etheric breath of this music now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, trend of the times - a louder guitar, influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the album premiere at Millenaris Park introduced the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the m2 Petőfi station, which has been playing recently from morning to night popular music, we have started to get caught up in swinging tunes of Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("underground Divas").
So everything's okay.
The Hvg.hu portal confessed to Baláz Zságera.
hvg.hu: In relation to this new hit, the question of how much remains what you play with the marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: Definition of peripheral music doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternatives and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and that's how it can be created only for sale, which makes it commercial.
Of course, even a good pop song can come from genuine internal needs.
In this spirit, the attitude, as it is accepted, works independently from the language and borders of the state.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience towards your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign music, especially from us to the west, light music has bigger traditions.
There are not only teenagers and 20 - year - olds in concert.
They are much more monitored by the changes in light music that take place around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where, how much your music is listening to?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we've never done music for the market.
In our country music is not intended, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen more at concerts, where mutual influence already works, but it is hidden only in in inaccessible changes of the moment.
Yet, I noticed that if one wants to suit the audience, it's no longer interesting ever since.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He's working solo and he's built his career to the west of us.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, no matter how much they try to explain our music.
We are more team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, we could not avoid our work being like Yonderboi, for several of us were separated from his band and went another way.
hvg.hu: At the top of the station, the song Wings of Love came first.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular way, did you consciously open yourself to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We didn't plan to write a hit that we'd sell a record to.
There's more to the song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is she - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then came the idea of putting together this choir from soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So we put together this six-member congregation - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judi Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized into Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that exactly how you intended the song, or did the girls transform something into it?
B.Zs.: The song has existed for a long time in an instrumental version, when the material was gathered on the board, we thought there was still something else to be needed for this song.
Sled chords led to a singing party join him.
That same day at night, I sang a melody to him that the girls later learned.
It all worked out for the first time and so spontaneously.
I remember the recovery, but, of course, Diva was needed for that.
It wouldn't work that hard with my voice.
Hvg.hu: Both on the board and on the concert it seemed that the girls were in the background.
They don't have solos (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing together and they're not louder than music, so music just doesn't come with their singing.
They also stood on the stage in the back.
On purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
On the contrary, the fact that we didn't want to split solo roles is intentional.
Even this song is about us forgetting our ego, who's where it belongs, and just letting the wings, the wings of love rise.
I wanted this euphoric condition that we felt when the song was born, others felt.
hvg.hu: What was the most work done?
B.Zs.: During the composition of music, even with one, harder pieces occurred more in mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for a long time, then everything slowly found its place as in some puzzle.
Hmmg.hu: Which song from your new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That's still changing when I'm doing the "disengagement" thing.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Sam.
Betrayal broker risked billions of underprivilegedness
Tremendous dephradant.
That's how he marks his old employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French bank giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic commercial bank.
She lost nearly five billion euros because of him.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to deal with his colleagues and, moreover, certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all large banking houses, he recognized the early crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He is mentally weaker," said his superiors, who sent the police to him.
However, according to Kerviel’s statement by the French media, such as Le Monde, it was a person who had a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says.
In summer he managed to make half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He sensed the occasion at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that the so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low income clients or those who had had problems with redemption in the past, will have problems.
However, this crisis had no impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet right.
At the end of the year, his profit went up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I made the first half a billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits he was falsifying records so that he wouldn't come to him.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though he started interested in the Eurex Stock Exchange.
Risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd come after him?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank is satisfactory."
Where did he get the will to risk so much?
He had to develop himself in his position gradually.
He entered Société Générale in 2000 just after he graduated from Lyon University.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
Yet he knew he would never make as much money as the others.
"At my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But shortly after the start, the first big success came.
Allianz's stock earned half a billion euros in the bombings of London.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew all about it, or more likely.
"As long as I made money, they would close their eyes."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After a weekend in January, he wanted to destroy it.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect for his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days for the past year.
A broker who does not have leave is a broker who does not want anyone to look at his records," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Yesterday, representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes, from which the Czech Republic can obtain EUR 14 billion in the coming years (approximately CZK 365 billion).
It is about half the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels from 2007 to 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around CZK 100 billion from the Business and Innovation Programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go to traffic.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be managed next year with CZK 90.8 billion.
The Business and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and businesses to raise funds for innovative business.
Companies should acquire finance for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the current use of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic has been amongst the least successful countries in newly adopted countries.
The 20-year sentence for the ex-President of Nicaragua has been confirmed by the court
The Court of Appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday a 20-year sentence for the former President of the country of Arnold Aleman, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to $100 million (almost CZK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a house arrest on his haciende near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 comes back behind bars, the AP agency is not clear at this time.
According to the President of the appeal, Ileana Pérez will now depend on prison agents to let Aleman serve his punishment at home or go to prison.
A court four years ago proved to Aleman that he regularly moved government money into the accounts of foreign businesses in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts were actually his relatives and his closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in the fund that Aleman founded on the financing of his election campaign in 2001.
That's how they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
He passed the ČSSD last year because Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford not to accept him.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote on government distrust, this time nothing dramatic has been done.
The Chamber of Deputies has approved this traditionally overlooked, although the most influential, law has passed its course of action.
It's a paradox.
Each government starts and ends with chapters and budget items, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is hidden behind the power rivalry of the government with the opposition.
That is more medialy grateful, and that is why he has much more attention in the media.
The question of politicians is much more interesting to the public than sharp numbers.
State budgets in the past social democratic governments have suffered three shortcomings that the government is unable to solve at one time for 2008:
The first is a high share of mandatory, so-called mandate expenses, which are not only pensions but also social benefits, which last year passed a silent "coalition" of ČSSD and KSČM before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the first failure.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficit of urban and municipal budgets.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
It's public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is the deficit of city budgets and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to taxes, fees and loans from banks, have obtained additional resources to invest, often hand over bonds that disproportionately owed to their town halls.
In recent years, they were able to repay these debts by selling mass shares of energy and other distribution networks that they received from the state from privatisation.
Now they don't have that source.
If we stick to the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going on for several years, like the rest of the world, with the growth phase constantly boasting of the ČSSD.
It was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances right.
Instead, the state indebted it more and more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
It's a huge shame that falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have in the last few years completely gone into giant proportions.
Even though some of the ridiculous populist expenditures approved this year before the elections have been abolished, unless, in the near future, the retirement and pension reform limits have been moved, then any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever is in charge of this will be the mere office.
With a small surplus, it can be said that ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxable money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, it cannot be this year's revolutionary budget, but it can only suspend the repression of normal expenditure by means of mandate expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the past governments failed to make the most of it in the last ten years.
If we do not want to really happen that the ruling politicians will become mere officials, then we must be patient and allow this not too strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and charges, peace to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will allow a gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the UK, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
In this way, more than a hundred billion dollars will enter the monetary markets through auctions.
In these bank auctions, they auction interest rates for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to the auction, and the next twenty-four will be made available to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time that the central banks of each country have agreed to a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is expected to solve the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," said Bernard Bauník of the Advisory Society of Economic Outlook Group in his report.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baushal said in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion due to outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billion more losses.
"The central banks must be really worried about what else might follow when they decided for this process," said ABN's chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, the yards will also lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with possible effects on global economic growth.
The central banks have thus decided after the so-called LIBOR rate was not reduced, the London interbank rate used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that the banks still had concerns about mutual lending, even though the central banks of the USA, Canada and Britain have reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another reduction in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks will contribute to the crisis, because they do not address the underlying problem, and that is the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is designed to mostly harm developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again referred to the issue of global warming.
Critics have now endured at the end of the UN international climate change conference in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not the green planet, he said that environmental debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which is not only a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also a fundamental difference between the rhetoric that guides them and the reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is only a fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his theme was very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction about the fact that the book appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "I have met many times only the cartoons of my opinions".
Now, therefore, those who want to read his uninterrupted attitudes can read.
Klaus reminded us that he is not a climatologist, but, in his opinion, he has sufficient assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also a nationalist.
The main conclusion of the book was that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no consistent view of the warming of the planet of all scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious and therefore do not pose a threat and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
Moreover, as a person with totality experience, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained that he was not opposed to "wise environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver's license didn't change 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to change an old driving licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for an exchange so the authorities can still issue a new card by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers would be on the road without valid permissions.
According to the authorities, the number of people who don't want to drive is not exactly the number of people who don't want to drive.
While the municipality reports a sharp drop in interest in the replacement of a driver's licence, the authorities in the metropolis are covered by applications and the interest in the exchange of a licence this week has increased.
The magistrate's picking up about 2,000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour waiting in the front.
In Prague, the driver's license has not yet been replaced by approximately 140,000 drivers.
It takes 20 days to issue a new I.D.
However, it is possible to apply for the issue within a shorter period of five days.
In that case, the driver will pay 500 crowns.
Motorists who fail to make the compulsory exchange of a licence by the end of the year and leave on the road without a valid driver's license will be threatened by a fine from January.
The wrongdoer will pay up to two thousand crowns.
But a police officer can also deal with a deal.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine shall be increased to CZK 2500.
According to earlier information, he could have received a fine from the city hall and a man who's not going anywhere.
He was supposed to pay 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously called on the authorities to be mild and impose a maximum of a thousand-year-old fine.
Karl Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, but tens of thousands of fines are not a threat to anyone.
According to him, a driving licence is a document for which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a citizens' card that every person has to have a valid ID.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driving licence.
Just take it or send it by registered mail to the relevant municipal office.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to apply.
However, motorists must gradually replace other types of driving licence.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 shall end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it's about 2.6 million more documents.
The court has reduced the sentence to a detective associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are charged with the crime association with the David Berdych gang, will go to 13 and 10 years in prison.
With definitive effect, the Prague Supreme Court decided on this, which reduced their sentences, one year and the other by two years.
Originally, it threatened the detectives of the Prague Division for the fight against organised crime for 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's decision, it is only possible to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also accused in this case, but he is only waiting for the first-line verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already received penalties in the sum of more than 16 years.
That's all he can get.
The Regional Court in January recognised, in particular, the participation of 19 guilty people in the robbery, the Supreme Court today dealt with the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have, since the beginning of the investigation, rejected the fact that this is a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemia Chamber, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, provided information to criminals from police sources, covered individual robbery and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30 percent for Opava and Koniařík.
The prosecution is a crime of a gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the robbery, which has often suffered serious harm to health, but also the abuse of public authority and illicit arms.
Police discovered illegal handguns, steel core missiles, laser sightings, or automatics during the house tours.
The gang, according to the charges, came in with tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to almost twenty men in this trial, the courts have already duly recognised the guilt of another Berdych robbery and a number of other people.
Other men around Berdych still testify in another trial, some of them have not yet been court-martialed.
The main presentation has so far been avoided by Tomáš Pót and Maroš Šulej, who are staying in Irish custody, where they are waiting for definitive decisions on their issue for prosecution to the Czech Republic.
Children's exchange account: 12 million
For the exchange of children at the hospital, the lawyer of the damaged families of Igor Veleba wants 12 million crowns indemnity after the hospital, plus legal expenses.
For each of the mothers of three million, for the father of two million and for the children of a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Legal representative of the hospital Ondrej He therefore disagrees with the Veleba proposal in principle.
"We refuse such a request, it is very high," said he after today's meeting.
"However, in order to make an opinion of the opposition, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has made.
Let's see if it's worth anything.
However, we are still in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds for all," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month she didn't raise her biological daughter.
He served bread as the basis for the negotiations on the compensation expert judgement, which was prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motol.
Parents of children, according to psychology experts and psychiatry, suffered psychological injury and stress in different degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better endured by men, even when they were struggling with regrets that they had not prevented the replacement of newborns.
Women are getting worse at the up-to-date trauma and what's happening right now, he's summed up Veleb's contents.
Veronica and Nikola changed nurses to the hospital last December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Chermáková to Przybyslavic and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslav Trojanová to Jabloňov.
Hejtman Vysočina Miloš outsaw each of the families of 100,000 crowns at the end of October for reimbursement of expenses resulting from the mistake of the three hospitals, which the region is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for the liability of damage.
In case of doubt, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they may apply for the assistance of the founder.
The courts have so far granted people relatively low compensation, the sum has been calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions crowns.
Soup Lost the Valas Kingdom
Bolek Polivka lost a dispute over the brand of Valaša Kingdom.
According to the Ostrava Regional Court, for the first time, he used the name Welsh King, but the project was built by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
The soup didn't attend the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over, and the client will appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabis and his team are parasiteing the popularity of Bolk Polivka," said Polivk's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, in the words of the Valasai kingdom, everyone will enjoy an actor and a comedian.
Harabis has the same opinion.
"We have almost ten years' work to do.
Getting money and making up events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and might have something to do with it.
They want to parasite on our work," he added.
Lucrative Business
According to the court, the name Welsh king used Poliv for the first time on his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzorichý.
But that was not the case with the intention to build a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš lost the idea of issuing the Welsh passports.
From the original recession, the trade and lucrative business activities were established, followed by Harabiš’s establishment of Valaš Kingdom.
In 1997 Polivka agreed to mention his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting their farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also stated that Harabiš only used the bare idea that Poliv had published for his business purpose.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polivka's project of the Valaš Kingdom certainly helped," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul project was Harabiš and his team, who focused intensively on him.
The cooperation of the parties today continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized official coronation for Polívka in Vsetina.
Since then, however, disputes began between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the establishment of the "King of Boleslav I. elected to continue".
The leading role in the kingdom then captured Jarmila Šuláková as the mother's queen at Harabish's impulse.
In 2002, Polivka brought an action before Harabis and his company, which the court today rejected.
Clear might bring Harabishem prepared to worship the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out of him.
The details and dates he didn't want to reveal yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like riding kings in the Slovak Republic.
The King should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Soup can apply," Harabiš said.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VT: disappearing prejudices
In fact, I've never been too much Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of sorting, driving and also the production could be classified as below average.
But the market is now the successor Peugeot 207, and it is much better.
And the combination called SW goes a little further, and I'm not left to think more than think.
When I tested the classic hatchback Peugeot 207, for example, I complained to the head on the back seat.
This is already the end of the complaint, because the bodywork of the combination means that they won't suffer two-meters in this direction.
By flight through the world
I'm going to move very fast so I don't do much repeating.
This is quite a successful design, where I have the only reindeer to the poor middle tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more design investment here, since the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The side lines have also improved significantly against the 206 model.
As far as space is concerned, there is a feeling of an increase in the size of the body.
The already mentioned lack of space above the head disappears in the combination.
Cuffs in the trunk
So the main thing on this car is his luggage man.
I have to evaluate him as very well accessible (including thanks to the leaching rear window) and as a decently stocky one.
The deaf spots are equipped with restraint rubber, which is an ideal compromise.
It can't be overcome, it can be extended, and it can be maintained even more difficult objects.
But let's stop together over the volume.
This is according to the tables in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is against competition rather the average value.
Not against the best-selling car in the Czech Republic - Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with a new generation of youngboleslav product, then we will find that Peugeot is falling by a lot of significant 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when loading the carriage, this value is even critical.
But if I had to lift the positive, I still have to mention the floor directly after the second row backrests have been pushed down or the very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre ignition with a power of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old who drives a family hatchback should look like.
It's quiet, it's a small consumption, and it's mostly stretching.
If I compare her with the harmful parallel that makes her feel like she's got a stuffed rag in the exhaust, then I can only be thrilled with her.
The Pricelist will give you a hint
The price of the car is not folk.
However, we must bear in mind that we tested a well equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a 14th lighter for 329 900 CZK is still missing.
Our aggregate costs CZK 410 900, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then put the equipment on top for an additional CZK 80,000.
But we still had the main airbags, the automatic air conditioning, the automatic discharge of the wipers, the electrical control of the rear windows...
Just the car costs everything 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but calculate Fabie's supplemental equipment and you'll get a lot like that.
So there's no choice but to make the mark.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is failing
British schools raise children from Eastern European countries, which raises concerns about the further development of local education with local residents.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has been facing a number of obstacles so far.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original population are being raised in violence.
The problem with the integration of Eastern European children in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants begin to escalate.
The fights, bullyings and fights between the pupils also moved into relations between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old man with an iron pole.
The guilty defends the boy from insulting her with racist abuses.
The police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The women of the man were supposed to have taken racist notes and cast stones on him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed up to a bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to let it go, he caught up with apples and pears, and then revealed his butt," she described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are both sides.
One of the local residents even called disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe to fight for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere at British schools between local and immigrants is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who are headed here for work.
About 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba the prettiest island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can happen to you if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will find it in a complete and even richer account.
Only on one island but you will find much more and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
In Spain, Cuba used to be the bastion of America.
Columbus referred to her as the most beautiful place a human eye's ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a treasure translation site that the Spaniards in America robbed and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel grew up at the very end of the 20th century.
He had him built by one of the bosses of the American mob, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially for prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses grew up, and after wide boulevards, cars were driven, which belonged to the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojjara he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio they left their signatures to the star showbusiness and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of Havana Bodeguita.
At the bar of the expensive Nacional hotel, you will have a cocktail mixed as you wish.
And those cult cars from the 1950s still go after Havana, because once imported gypsies and violets in that salty and wet air have been rotted a long time ago.
Even though Havana, especially its oldest part, is greatly depleted, there are not so many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere near there.
Other places are turning into beauty, like Trinidad.
Given that tourism brings so much money, its development is green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another selection, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by train drivers.
The third of the vast plantations were tied to the sugar confectionery along the narrow tracks of steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not renewed for decades, and so there are working machines, whose peers are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not miss.
And so, Varader, or Havana, you don't have to write too much.
Perhaps just to remind you that the museum is already mentioned in Hemingway's estate and that those who like this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Vinjales One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the valley of Vinjales on the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from limestone.
Mosques, limestones and rocks are steeply lifted from the bottom of the valley, and in their cavities a fertile soil has been caught, which makes them also a snowy rock covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where maybe the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
With its final form you can meet, if you visit any of the Havana factory for the production of cigars.
Maybe someone's interested in the fact that there was a Chilean piece of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
The ancient city, which was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
The glory and wealth brought him a trade of slaves and sugar.
Richness was transformed into the beauty and exhibition of a small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and Escambray, is a place so remote that there was no road between the rest of the country and the rest of the country in the 1950s.
She's helped him stay out of isolation.
There was nothing there, and that's why nothing happened. Everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If a person has more time in Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth to see even interesting places in the vicinity, such as the Playa Ancón beach, or the Sugar Valley.
In the evening it is due to go to Casa de la Música, which comes alive after dark and the music in it remains silent over the morning.
Baracoa
Some of the towns in the east of Cuba call the most beautiful on the island.
That is certainly what is affecting the path itself.
Both roads that lead there from Guantánama must cross the high and divided mountains and pass through nature, which the human activity almost did not notice.
Due to unbroken nature, the eastern island of Cuba has registered UNESCO on the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate, in the church they have the Columbus Cross (in fact formed about a hundred years after Columbus's cruise) and from the hill where the castle stands and today El Castillo Hotel is seen several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestra, the Gulf of Pigs and the Isle of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Cuban patron of Caridad del Cobre, about santeria, African religions, which confess the descendants of the former slaves, you could all describe a lot of pages.
But, as they say rightly, it's better to see one day.
The Allies in Afghanistan are passive, says Americans
Few soldiers and the lack of equipment needed have an impact on Afghanistan’s mission, according to the United States.
According to NATO, the defense minister Robert Gates should draw a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place, as it were imagined, has been agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, by representatives of the countries that have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement today, eight participating states are also discussing further plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States has called on NATO units to become more active this week through defense minister Robert Gates, the United Kingdom sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance.
"The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow residents to start their own development of the economy and security," said the BBC British Defence Minister Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is the highest in the last five years, according to U.S. military data.
The number of violent events increased by 27 percent compared to last year, in the southern Helmand province by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, some a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, allies have reached a limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
More helicopters, soldiers and experts are specifically asking for training of Afghan troops.
"We will have to seriously consider the specific objectives for the next time and the ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke in a similar way today.
"I'm not happy about what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is little," he told Reuters De Hoop at the conclusion of three-day discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
In recent months, there has also been disputes among the participating countries about whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticised for passivity.
"Germans have quite a number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the fighting claims on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan pots are revealed: The Germans play while our boys fight," wrote Sun in the material, supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into counterattack and printed a picture of the British unit at the ragby fight in southern Afghanistan.
The government debt will go out on a trillion in 2009
For each of Bohemia there is a government debt of over 84.000 crowns.
The total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government was planning to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better developments in the management of the state budget.
The government debt of the Czech Republic increased to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In nine months this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has decreased by CZK 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on the state debt from the beginning of October today.
There is a debt in each Czech Republic over 84.000 crowns.
Over the whole of last year, the state owed itself more than CZK 111 billion.
"For the time being, due to the lower deficit for next year, we could only overcome the limit of a trillion crowns in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and trillion crowns," said the iHNed.cz analyst Patria Finance David Marek.
Similarly, the analyst Next Finance Vladimír Picora sees this: "We could get over one trillion in 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more money, it could move to 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he said.
Debts grow
The government debt consists of central government debts and is mainly generated by the accumulation of government deficits.
The government debt is financed by bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
So far, the State’s internal debt has increased by CZK 38.5 billion to CZK 719.4 billion.
So far, the foreign debt of the state has increased by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt at the end of September amounted to CZK 803.3 billion and has decreased by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent year-on-year for the first to third quarter, which is indeed a lot to do with the economy's success.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by bonds, with an increase of 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that it will deal with what it will do when the pension reform is here," he commented.
Better than expected
The state debt finance and management strategy for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better developments in the management of the state budget.
The amount is mainly the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the expected CZK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, these are planned maximum resources for the Czech consolidation agency CZK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of sovereign bonds for CZK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is supposed to come to the court today in Khartoum for giving her name to a bear bear.
The British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by the Chartoum Tribunal on Thursday night, as her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting six to seven-year-olds give the bear a bear the name Mohammed despite the fact that any representation of the prophet Islam is forbidden.
She was punished by whip wounds.
This British four-year-old teacher, working at the Unity High School in Sudan, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, our story begins in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven - year - old students to choose a name for a class bear bear.
"The mouth of the children will be eight names, between Hasan, Abdulah and Mohammed", says the school manager Robert Boulos.
After a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children will eventually be chosen as the favorite name Mohammed.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very extended first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohammed".
The teddy bear himself did not have a label with this name, but the difficulty is in displaying a prophet considered an insult to Islam itself.
One of the Muslims Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, specified that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive for any religious faith: "I only regret that she asked children to vote for a name," he said.
This view is shared by many teachers who describe it as "very careful to their pupils" and add that "they never speak of religion in class".
Let us remind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given first name in the UK, in English it is written in 14 different ways.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, represents a way to honor the prophet (it is often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to give them to a toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations, this Wednesday in Vienna did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbian and Kosov Albanians ended the sixth and last round of talks on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without overcoming the different views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on status", said the European Negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during the press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "at stake" and called on Belgrade and Pristin to ensure their commitment to peace and were ready for dialogue even after the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we enter a difficult period", added he that "it is evident that the situation is tense".
The negotiations end on 10 December
The Troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, are last sent to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent are Albanian-speaking populations, could show up in a clearer light on December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, not far from Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the UN, in August this year, have entrusted Troika with new negotiations.
The US and Europeans expect the talks to be concluded on 10 December.
On the other hand, Russians, who have previously blocked Kosovo's independence in the UN Security Council, insist that negotiations continue after this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", said Bocan-Charchenko.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of international administration, the West considers Kosovo’s independence under the supervision of the EU as the only solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare its independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"God, we have not reached any agreement," said the president of the Kosov Authority, Fatmir Sejdius, in a Baden hotel, where since Monday this "negotiation of the last chance" has been taking place.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of the Albanians and future Prime Minister of the Province, expressed his regret.
However, he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade "is the past that led to murders and deportations".
"Dominum Effect"
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tadić considers that the compromise still comes into consideration and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the possible unilateral independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars for independence in the 1990s.
"But for Serbia it does not mean it," he said, "the compromise is impossible".
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should belong solely to the Security Council in which its Russian ally had the right to a veto.
"The Kosovský Parliament will have the last word."
"For Serbia only a solution derived from the Security Council is acceptable," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"This meeting lasted for two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
He replied to the reporters of Fatmir Sedjiu that "the last word on status will have a Kosovský Parliament" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking people, there would be "agreement" with the West.
Bush made a deal on Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, called from his impulse, American President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He specified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abas agreed to open an immediate negotiations with the intention of solving once and for all 60 years a dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude the peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the "terrorism infrastructure" and Israel must end their colonial activities, said Bush and recalled the responsibilities that flow from the "road map" to the peace they adopted in 2003 for both sides.
The White House’s boss stressed that the negotiations between Israel and Palestine’s self-government aim at "the conclusion of a peace treaty that would solve all undecided issues without exception, including central issues".
This declaration includes three questions which are at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future frontiers of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees evicted during the conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of today's state of Israel.
He took up the words of the American President and stressed that the subsequent negotiations should be "total and thorough" and that it should touch all aspects of the solution, with the mention of "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things".
Mr Olmert then spoke to the General Court, who expressed the view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it is necessary to be planted in order to be concluded during 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as a term for the implementation of his "visa of two states", the Palestinian and Israeli side by side.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has accepted an undertaking in this sense before it has decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, which offered Israel peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories taken from the war in 1967, including Eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "the crucifix in the history of the Middle East in particular because it fights the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", judges Prince Saud in an interview, which he gave to one Arabic-speaking daily with Saudi capital.
According to the D.A., police are not liable.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such tiny black chronicles, the official versions do not match what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of an accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the French State Police General (Inspection Generale de la police nationale, IGPN), a police car passed on Sunday shortly after 17 p.m. in the village of Villiers-le-Michel.
"The vehicle was not in the mode of intervention, but it was on patrol and passed at 40 to 50 km/h, with no side lights on," explains the police.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered, and therefore without permission to ride on public roads" (read below), controlled by two young men without helmets, drove "very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit the left side of a police car after not giving priority to the right", stated one police officer.
The test for alcohol in the blood tested on the crew of the vehicle has shown negative.
The condition of the car (the broken front, the broken windshield, the broken bumpers) shows the sharpness of the impact.
She responded very quickly to the District Prosecutor Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givra and announced yesterday morning that IGPN had entrusted with an investigation "the activities of inadvertently killing and not providing assistance to persons in danger", which was also adopted by the Directorate-Generale de la sÃreté publicque du Val-d'Oise (director of the Regional Police Department Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by IGPN excludes the responsibility of police officers for the accident at this stage.
According to the official, three witnesses of the accident, who were questioned on Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, that the mini-engineer approached them quite quickly from the left".
Some sort of rift, undoubtedly caused by the ground-clips rubping, yesterday showed that both vehicles remained sealed up until the police car was able to freeze.
The vehicles have been secured and passed through technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed yesterday on both victims' bodies.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel among people, rumors spread quickly that police officers should quickly leave the scene without providing the first aid to two young men.
IGPN had, in all due time, also to rule out "any serious fault" at this point.
"It is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more searching and with which to be very careful", noted the police source.
The "Liberation" daily met with the eyewitness of those few moments following the accident.
One of his windows leads right to where the accident occurred.
"At the same time, we and my cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, ran down to try to resurrect them," says this witness.
There was nothing we could do."
Then he saw a "sneaking, totally scared cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the rapidly growing tension and confidently present, the situation of young people is hopeless, police officers were taken by car of colleagues who had arrived in the meantime.
According to the same witness, an ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the cops left."
They also did heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities did not rush the young people to help.
First aid was given to these youths.
Firemen arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to save them", said the prosecutor.
The tension in Pakistan is growing
On Monday, Pakistani police repressed the first demonstration since the announcement of extraordinary state by General Musharaf, two days before.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken in the context of an exceptional state were injured by grenades with tear gas, which, according to witnesses, used order forces.
The last appointed ones responded with stones, hurting several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were to be called.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced a demonstration, due to waves of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The streets of access to the Supreme Court were overturned on Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, a movement of lawyers received the support of religious parties grouped in the political strong alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "taught the people to send flowers to judges who opposed the extraordinary state, and garbage to those who took an oath before Musharraf".
"Musharaf's promise doesn't apply."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is a direct target of the emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the next few days, he was due to comment on the legality of President Musharaf's re-elect in the indirect presidential election that took place on 6 October.
The President of the court Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
"All we have witnessed is illegal, anti-impaired, and against the Supreme Court's rulings," said the official in The News.
Parvíz Musharaf's promise to give up the military leadership and become a civilian president, "not paying" after the introduction of an exceptional state, was declared Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by the 15th November when his first presidential mandate ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Otherwise, the Pakistani government also rebutted speculation in the country, according to which the Deputy Head of the Army was to order President Musharraf to house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancy is still an unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancy.
More than one pregnancy of three (36%) is yet to be expected, reveals the studies conducted by the French Institute of National d'études demographiques (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuvirth Act, which in France passed the contraception.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancy.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of failure rates, estimated Ined.
The law of contraception has, after all, allowed a better "fertility control", claims the Institute and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years of age has now reached 60% from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight births of ten are well planned today.
One couple of the five has even had birth calculated for a month exactly and as far as possible in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant annual period for the birth of the child.
The Remarkable Repair of Space Station
More than seven hours of work in the universe needed the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) for the remarkable repair of the disintegrated solar panel necessary for further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky climb to the universe, which collected records of length, distance from residential modules, speed with which it was planned and degree of "kutilism", which astronauts spent on repairing.
The troubles appeared on Tuesday, while the astronauts from the Discovery ship unloaded the Harmony module, a large rolling unit designed to install the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is some sort of landing pier for the lab module.
These, however, need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to relocate the 17th-point electricity-producing module using solar panels already located on the ISS to anchor at its final station.
After she moved it, the crew began to decompose the seventy-meter solar panels of the module.
And there was one of the panels that spread out as a pull harmony, as a result of the clamping of the cable, damaged on the surface almost one metre.
Decomposition has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally to perform a control output on the Discovery ship, and then go fix another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to focus on the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, added to the arm of the station, and made a repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (space walker) of the American Aviation and Space Office (NASA).
Tall, sturdy, very skillful, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
In his 46 years, this original profession was commissioned by a doctor to "operate" the "poised" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed it to the damaged places of some sort of "dear".
He was assisted by the second "spacewalker" who remained near the settlement chamber, and also from the inside, the other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the commander of the crew.
The tools he used, namely a mini-hoc with an insulating device, in order to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, they invented and "in kutilsk" produced astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely spread out and then invented his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts had a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts returned to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares weaken
The EADS shares on the Paris Stock Exchange are losing significantly after this company operating in the air and defence industry has announced that it will have to spend EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion in order to face the delays of the A400M aircraft.
The EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at €21.96.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 due to delays resulting from the slow progress towards the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition for the opening flight.
The price for reducing the delay in military cargo supplies, announced in October, was calculated "for EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus", announced the parent undertaking of the European EADS designer.
Due to these costs, EADS, next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results, will be forced to report a new profit outlook before deduction of interest and taxes (EBIT).
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds with a six-month delay.
To remind us that the production results of the EADS in 2006 fell by 86 % in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380.
Originally, the group assumed that the first delivery of A400M to the French Army would be made in October 2009.
Decision on the status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without any strained expectation: the Russians will mostly elect the party of President Putin, the United Russia.
Confirming so, after the end of a very few free election campaigns, their urges for stability, and for authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimír Putin will send a television message to voters at public service stations, but the content of which is kept secret.
He thus acts as the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremel party, who seems to celebrate the crushing victory.
When he accepted ambassadors of foreign states yesterday, the president left nothing out of him and settled with the next attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, and we wish for honest, perhaps the most transparent and open elections, without the slightest defect in beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it is far from true.
They condemn a campaign marked by different pressures.
The communist leader Gennadi Zjuganov says that "there have never been such a dirty election or a Jelcin."
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former world champion in chess Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, continues to be banned from visitation, according to her attorney.
"Rusom remained the mentality of homo sovietica"
In the background of these parliamentary elections with simple expectations, there are two far more open questions:
- "Who's going to become Putin's successor to the presidential office?
The official letter was published yesterday on the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; the candidates may represent the public by 23 December.
Vladimír Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot pursue a third mandate in a row.
However, there is no successor.
- What part will Putin play after March?
Will he be the Prime Minister?
Or the boss of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful party United Russia, who chooses the government and the president?
Either way, the leaving authority will win the entire line in parliamentary, as will the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"Rusům remained the mentality of homo sovietica, does not feel to be masters of his fate", says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University in Sankt-Petěrburg observes the more distant context: civil society has acquired, in this country, five centuries after Europe, a delay; that famous spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s "Putin has established a paternalist model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially because this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by some economic well-being", Mario Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians are now "voluntaryly relinquishing their personal responsibility" which they have shown shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon concerns all social layers, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of the total number of 85 heads of the Russian regions) manage the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Czedrechenko, four-year-old professor: "What to think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, depicting the 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, open to the public.
The 47 million archive documents stored in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were accessible to this time only for a "humanity" purpose, i.e. individually and in particular, at the request of the former victim or his authorised persons.
Eleven states responsible for the management of archives - among which is Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Given that the process of ratification of this Agreement is all over, the opening yesterday has become effective.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to explore "especially the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives led by the International Committee on the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several countries, among them Germany, opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
What are the anticipated homosexuality or mental disability of some of the victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrests assembled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for practical purposes of finding deported or forced work submitted to civilians, bringing them proof of their internationalisation in order to open the way of compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only a limited benefit.
"There is nothing to be expected from these documents", said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin Technische Universität in 2006.
The EU and India want free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is almost €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner, representing 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are looking forward to signing the Free Trade Agreement in 2008, announced the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nat.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers have given the European Commission a green light to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the South-East Asian Association. Bilateral trade between Europe and India is now nearly €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner, representing 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
"The Free Trade Agreement will greatly adopt both economies" and "India will gain better market access for 450 million prosperous Europeans", said Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, specified by the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants will exchange "EUR 47 billion in goods" and "EUR 10 billion in services" this week Danièle Smadja, Head of Delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential".The EU and India will meet at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso on Friday.

The English bank noted its concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the Bank of England showed that it intends to mitigate its current concerns about the deterioration of credit market conditions and announced an offer of £10 billion in a five-week auction for a basic interest rate of 5.75 %, an offer of unusually long duration.
"In order to ease the concerns under which the conditions in the financial markets will be very adverse at the end of the year and give banks greater certainty in the way in which they provide their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during the maintenance period, which will start on 6 December in the form of a five-week operation on the open market," she announced in communication.
The Bank points out that £10 billion (14 billion) will thus be placed on the financial market on December 6th at 12.15 GMT until January 10th at the basic interest rate.
It seems that this is the first time BOE is pumping cash into the financial market in a five-week operation on an open market.
They normally last a week.
BOE adds in its communication that "it remains ready to take further measures to maintain interbank interest rates on a daily basis" of interbank loans at the same level with its base rate.
The interbank interest rate was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been set at 6,6 %, the highest rate since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the English bank have been linked to the rates of charge which have discouraged the banks from using this offer.
According to certain speculations enhanced by the evolution of the pound rate against the euro, many preferred to decide for the sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more discreetness.
UMP (Union pour un mousement populaire, Union for People's Movements) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Center) refuse to deal with the proposals of Socialists (PS) on purchaseability
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss on Thursday the various paragraphs of the socialist draft law on the purchase capacity, which is equal to the rejection of the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the bill came within the so-called socialist "impose" (a meeting initiated by an individual Chamber of Deputies) and contained a number of measures taken on Tuesday by the Presidency of the PS, which included an increase in the employment premium by 50%, a renewal of fluctuating TIPs, a transport check or a rental regulation.
Given that the UMP and NC voted against individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate that had become an opportunity to exchange views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television show on the purchase of capacity.
The PS Chief Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club would re-submit these proposals in the form of supplements to the amendment of the Finance Act to be discussed next week.
A New Festival Is Born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Philadelphia founded a new festival, he announced this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey in cooperation with the British organizer Melvin Benn Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration," revealed Charlie Jones of the C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination camper station.
The festival should take place from 8 to 10 August at a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, once known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989 he took charge of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 he added Melvin Benn to his portfolio Leeds Festival, and in 2006 Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, a co-owner, is also responsible for production, licensing and organisational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury "the most inspiring event", which he has ever experienced and says that his company and Melvin Benn are working together to give the region a European style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as the market, and along with Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"I have dealt with the city and the Commission has been motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, we have become political because of the current leadership, adds Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are about to set up a great festival at an exceptional place that will last serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago's Grant Park, after being excellent on the festival scene by organizing Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to 9.8M$ and 11.3M$.
Both of these festivals are held in an urban environment.
"The European model of the Melvin Benna Festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals are taking place in green areas in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both the concepts in a certain way in order to create both the impression of the rural festival in Europe and the city after America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Even Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastic about this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last appointed refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims that they are "enough enough to allow them to invest in such an event and to welcome a festival that will, hopefully, have a long duration".
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will capture 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is still being published.
"Vineland will have a rock breath, but music will be varied to attract a wide spectrum of viewers as far as possible," says Carlie Jones.
C3 partners who received the Top Independent Promotion Award in the final Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself is against it...
This persuasion mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
His mandate, however, is "politically demanding" because the Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it hard to fall into the claws of the Governor?
"It's important to be careful, it's an industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those they will consider to be the best", he said.
Honba for Festivals
For the moment, however, Denise Turcottea is a priority for promoting the local film.
She's already started chasing the Oscars.
At all West Coast festivals, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's about presenting Québeck's films, alerting them and ensuring that the directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th year of the Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January he will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shakespeare hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
Québec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will it happen at the end of the year on the Marathon Stock Exchange? Experty divided the subprime crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and the investors already expect me to have a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will occur.
Banif believes that 'from a statistical point of view, December has a positive course on the stock exchange'.
However, it is not appropriate to create forecasts solely on the basis of statistics because, in the current context of the markets, there are, at least in the short term, certain doubts".
These experts do not assume that the stock exchange has been expanding over the last few weeks and state that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the missing alternatives to guarantees, especially fixed income affected by the turnover effect on quality securities, both in long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather quiet course, not without volatility, 'especially because the impact of a likely fall in the rates of the Fed (Federal Reserve) is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the danger of incentives for inflationary pressures is unknown.'
Javier Barrio, Head of Sales of BPI Bank in Spain, agrees that there is no right moment for a bold declaration that there will be a marathon.
"There is no reason for joy," assures this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4 % of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15 9457 points.
Still, all the experts don't have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points by regrouping portfolios and traditional deposits on pension insurance, which takes place annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that everything will be a little different this year, because he believes that the marathon will happen sooner, in the second week of December after an extended weekend on the occasion of the Day of the Constitution.
The analyst mentioned does not consider that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Oucha, an analyst at the same time Inversis Banco, estimates that we are approaching the technical levels, and "that is why we could observe a reflection of the index generated by the US reports on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
Analysts believe that these effects will be positive.
Analysts agree with the selection of titles to bring Ibex to the new maximum quotations.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is a turn for strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
On the other hand, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that growth will go hand in hand with banking and industry.
Building companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this marathon if it occurs.
"ACS has been reinstated for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will go the same way", explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to an increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technology will also perform very well, even if it is not represented on the Spanish market.
Five times within seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been in two cases of a month of decline.
The actual marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in an administrative year when stock exchanges ended the crisis caused by the bursting of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28,17 %, December recorded an increase of 6,68 %.
We will see if 2007 will be the fifth profitable year in order (as of January Ibex increased by 8.36 %) and whether he will manage to have his marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of the Bank Popular will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The popular bank has decided to upgrade most of its branches.
A total of two hundred located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Also for other Spanish entities, because it is the first group to decide to make such a leap and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group, which has also several times ensured that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to cancel the opening period of 75 % of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening period by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be crucial for other entities to join or not join other entities in this initiative, which support the opening times of business.
That's exactly what the target of the project, set out by the Bank of Popular.
Obtain individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, trades and shops from selected streets where branches will be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, as this is not the opening of new branches, but only the adjustments that already exist.
For this reason, the bank will modernize branches already in business areas by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
The extension of the opening time is supplemented by a different concept of branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in brighter colours.
The commercial manager of Ángel Rivera assures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger recruitment of staff, as it passes from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with premises for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
The popular bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches were selected in the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to River it seems to have been a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2 500 branches.
And 60 other immigrants who are operated under the Mundocredit brand also have a very long opening hours and are even open on Sundays and on holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, when many of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients', says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telefónica on mobile sales through external personnel.
Telecinco for the first time on the stock exchange doubled the value of its rival Antena 3
We did it.
This sentence was expressed yesterday by Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade, when he said that the television he is running doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
There was only one thing that ruined his joy: 'what I'm sorry about is that it didn't happen because we would grow more, but because we fell less'.
And at the same time, he stressed that thanks to the weak market, we 'we fell less'.
Telecinco terminated trade by a change of 2.54% yesterday.
This profit has shifted their loss for the previous part of the year to 15,66 %.
The storm value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) in the participation of Vocent (the next 13%) is 4,488,88 million euro, according to Bloomberg data.
Its competitor Antena 3, which dropped by 1,52 % yesterday and dropped by 40,5 % overall from January, has a half value of 2 193,46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies that have been evaluated amounts to 3.571 billion for Sogecable, 2 518.53 million Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasil, comparison with Antena 3 is offered because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do on the same market at what price and how we evaluate it in observation."
Telecinco announced last week that this year, with overcoming billions of gross advertising revenues, she was going to be the first TV channel to assure Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publicespaña, a branch that provides advertising for the group.
If the anticipated data were actually achieved, this TV channel would have increased its advertising turnover by 3.6% this year compared to 965,4 million in 2006.
In the first nine months of the year, Antena’s net turnover increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million) while the net TV revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on is that the best relative development of Telecinco at the stock exchange is an increased pay out, which has so far been maintained: in 2006, this company, which is chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, has divided 100 % of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early for decision-making, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol, together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already increased 33% Endemol."
According to analysts, the market in these moments is showing some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimate of Telecinco's profits in 2008 4 % and in 2009 7 %.
This is because they explain that the anticipated increase in revenue from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antena 3's expected profit, i.e. 4.5 % in 2008 and 7.5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends purchasing both titles mainly on the basis of increased income for dividend and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: evaluates Telecinco (collection) better than Atenu 3 (maintain) because of its 'multi-priority' and the growth of trade.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends not to underestimate them because they face 'similar threats' (a oversaturated market and a deteriorating economic environment).
Congress approved the transposition of MiFID valid from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations which were concluded today by the vote of the Congress on amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has submitted a public hearing of a regulation which is developing a new law, with a view to both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of each party have concurred the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which governs the Securities Trading Act, foresees the modernisation of financial markets and at the same time strengthens investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will provide financial advice services for both specialised companies and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial service companies (ESIS), financial consultancy companies (AFIs) that join securities companies, securities brokering agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the performance of operations with financial instruments is expanded by connecting multilateral trading systems and internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets that will compete with current stock exchange brokers.
Furthermore, the law obliges investment services companies to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risks and risk-solving practices, and requires a report of all operations carried out to simplify the supervision by CNMV.
During the discussion at the Trade Commission of Congress, several adjustments were included, among which it stands out that securitised claims are considered to be a "composite" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what occurred in the US with high risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally define the functions that could be held by bachelors in the field of economics and management for 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which sets out professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide product and client trading services for different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five decimals to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides preliminary information on the evolution of prices in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to Eurostat and Central European Bank (CEB) policy to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same process as is used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore it does not necessarily match the final data that will come into being on 14 December of this year.
"The ISC will continue to maintain at a relatively high level"
The Second Vice-President of the Government and the Minister for Economy Pedro Solbes stated that the November ISC increase to 4.1% was "temporary" but also predicted that the price index would continue to be relatively "high" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes specified in the Congress's bulletins that "even if it is not a good number", Spain's inflation differential towards monetary union has remained "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month when the government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected about 4%", said the Minister for Economic Affairs about today.
Virginia plans to make EUR 42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (€68.8 billion).
The bank then managed record deposits worth more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually, within two and a half months, did not trust clients even though the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and would extend it until the end of the crisis.
Virginia, which will replace the entity's trade mark with Virgin Money, needs to obtain around a quarter of the revenue entered in the British banks in the next three years to win the remaining 18 billion pounds and thus achieve the target of 30 billion.
The team of the Magnate Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom by its obvious advertising campaigns, is planning to spend 50 million pounds (about EUR 70 million) per year for advertising and marketing in order to achieve its purpose.
This week Banka Northern Rock has identified the offer of a Virginia consortium that consists of three other companies as the one that prefers to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totana arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
Today, in the early hours of the morning, the Civil Guard detained the current mayor of the city of Totana (from the People's Party) due to his alleged involvement in corruption practices in the construction that were revealed this week.
Also, one of the city hall's secretarys and the head of the local police was arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, a contemporary human MP in May this year, and until that time the mayor of the village, who, according to the investigators, could have been the 'head' of the whole company.
Police officers shall continue to monitor the buildings of the City Hall and the Construction Commission and shall not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, he was charged with a lawyer named Juan Morales, the chief suspect in corruption practices in construction that were revealed at the beginning of this week.
As Caden SER informed yesterday, the lawyer of Juan Morales, who was examined, was arrested when he left Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
Moreover, according to the sources of investigation, Morales' alleged commission selection is under investigation for its signature of an agreement on construction with the Galician construction company, which has been reclassified by 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepted the offer of the state at the head of the Toledian candidate of the PSOE and, if they win, President of Congress
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the proposal from the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapater to stand in the next general elections at the head of the list of candidates of the PSOE (Spain Workers' Party) in Toled and, in the event that the socialists win the general election, become the President of the Congress.
So, at the press conference, the secretary of the PSOE announced both José Blanco and Bono, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place at the federal headquarters of the party today.
The executive chief justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count the best" and Bono "is among the best."
He also noted that "yes," it seems, that this La Mancha politician would be a candidate for a socialist party at the President of Congress if the socialists won the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who published his decision on 15 November not to run in the next general elections and leave his active political career in order to fight climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister of the government insisted on him constantly to return to the top policy he had left two years ago.
He further stated that, as well as citizens, they knew who would be Deputy Minister of Economy, if the PSOE were to win the election, his party wanted to announce "transparent form" who would chair Congress.
If Bono obtains this function, he hopes to transform the House into a "house of respect and not a house of lamentation or a cry" and achieves that "he will become more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where Congress, the Prime Minister of the Senate, cannot be in peace and peace, has interrupted 26 times."
He also praised the address of current President Manuel Marín and his "good work" and so far did not want to imagine himself in his place, so as not to reduce himself to what he said his opponents might consider "the greatness".
Climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subject to merciless persecution, both those who view its predictions sceptically and those who prefer other political and social struggles must show strong coherence.
Moreover, to have a leader of the movement, which is the Prime Minister of government like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign the "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why the activities or inaction of his government have contributed significantly to Spain’s failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors this is happening, and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
Moreover, it makes him explain to the Spanish as clearly as possible what measures it intends to take to delay climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by what habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But we can't see that kind of explanation, we can't see it.
It's because it's necessary to sacrifice and pay.
The measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline proposed by PSOE (Spain Socialist Party), Zapater seemed so risky from the point of view of the elections that he had hurried to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so that it doesn't cost anything, pure propaganda, passwords that miss any real meaning.
By impressive phrases, committees, committees, protocols and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this gentleman is so useful for an election campaign that doesn't even speak, he doesn't charge, he does not demand anything, but he is an ornament of the estates and he causes it to happen to him.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contracting party and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool ourselves with a fan.
Mayor and Chief of Local Police of Totana detained for suspected corruption practices in construction
As reported by the investigators, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of Totana, José Martínez Andrea, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one entrepreneur in the hospitality, for suspicion of committing crimes in construction.
The mayor was arrested at his place of residence and transferred to the City Hall, where he is now located along with a number of police officers who also came to the Construction Commission and the City Company for Industrial Land Management and Flats.
The three arrests added to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid during an operation linked to the retraining of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land suitable for construction so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are charged with short trial in the first instance of Totana.
Six first arrests were handed over to court today.
According to information sources, former mayor Totana is being investigated and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
In addition, his former wife, the owner of the real estate office, registered today in Totana and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N.A., director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and entrepreneur of Viga, was arrested in Niger (Pontevedra Province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and over which bribes were transferred.
The investigation was carried out by a group for crimes in the construction of an operational unit of Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to arrest, also carried out eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to the arrests, based in Madrid, Vig, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Marid Province) and Totana.
In Totana there was only one person trapped in the area of a very famous owner of a poultry meat product company that could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned as the largest residential complex of Totana, a city in Berlin, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa".
The company gained 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project was intended to double the settlement of a village with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruňa, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.

If you don't mind, we'll leave the book of the month and maybe we'll get attacked by other awards and competitions in the meantime.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from last night's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the start of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18, on the same day that even the critic of Blackburn's book appeared there by coincidence:
"The scope of philosophy's subject matter has penetrated public debate in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokela.
The victim's killer, high school student, quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his notes.
Pekka Elo, a councillor for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the site of Helsingin Sanomat that the professors take a critical view of Plato and claimed that it is not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory primary course of philosophy at secondary schools."

One colleague informs of the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the criminal code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime at a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you disappear in a store with a price of less than EUR 400, it is considered a mere violation (Art. 623.1).
B. If you alienate up to 1 000 euros in the store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading ( § 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (Art. 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in fights than compact shifts.
Participation in riots shall be at a rate of between three months and one year ( § 154 of the Criminal Code) and the rate of exchange for compact ones would be between six months and two years.
(Art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD according to § 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected films is punishable more than the provision of juvenile pornographic materials (Art. 186).
So if my colleague's right, someone's arm is wrong, and that's right.

My doctor is going to push one of his strange research articles called "The money causes brain activation, especially if the others get less."
Or the feelings that a month's pay for employees depend on how much they make.
The research was carried out at Bonn University using magnetic resonances on the tomography and the results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and the head of the group Views of the neurocognition of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The largest activation occurred when the participant reacted correctly and his colleague mistakenly."
The researchers observed that if they succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one got doubled, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The applicant for the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has for eight years been relentlessly persecuting a criminal from the Balkan war from the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in the Hague.
Its mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, where 8,000 Bosnia Muslims were killed, former General Ratko Mladič and former leader of the Bossen Serbs Radovan Karadžič, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which they took over the title of Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, not listed in Spain), which at the pace of the detective thriller, from Belgrade to New York, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in persecuting escaped criminals and pressure on the relevant states to pull the net.
What insurance is suitable for me?
The insurance of a car that protects the driver in the event of an accident is a significant expenditure which depends on different factors such as age, condition, sex, duration of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
The choice of suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we're talking about.
The car insurance is the agreement between the insurance company and the insurance company.
This liability shall take the form of an insurance contract which provides that an insurance undertaking is to receive an agreed insurance amount at a certain amount for taking care of the damage in the event of an insurance event.
The insurance price shall be the insurance that is determined in the light of different factors, such as age, condition, gender, duration of the driving licence, type of vehicle that is insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the greater the probability of an accident, the higher the rate of insurance.
For this reason, both the 25-year-old and the female population must pay lower insurance, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, insurance companies came to the conclusion that married people have fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will have an impact on the frequency of the journey, thus likely to have an accident.
The growth in the frequency of driving increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must study well the situation in order to choose such insurance as best suited to his insurance profile.
We will show ourselves the most important variables for choosing one or the type of insurance that, in addition to meeting the type of insurance company, will also be at reasonable cost.
People under the age of 25 encounter various disadvantages such as little driving experience and a short driving licence when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
Although it is ideal for good cover-up is insurance against all risks, there are cheaper options.
The most careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a premium to gain insurance cover for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This kind of contract would presuppose the client’s participation in the payment of the insurance event.
"The number of insurance payments provided by the client will be determined in advance by determining the insurance price, which will be higher as a result of the participation," explains Luis Noguera, head of the company First Europe in Spain, an internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants by insurance against damage caused by others, but not against damage to their own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A recommendation.
If you are less than twenty-five years old, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate held by the insurance company.
On the other hand, the small is the increase in the basic rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to raise the bonus", explains Noguera.
After crossing the limit of twenty-five years, drivers are easier when they go to order insurance, as the client's risk index decreases, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks with a discount.
"Young people are not usually able to take advantage of the experience gained in advance at the time of the accident and even when driving," assures the director of the European company in Spain and adds that most accidents occur in the second year of the proceedings, when the fear of the newcomer has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not have children yet, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if his economic situation permits.
The families with children are considered insurance companies with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against any risk with a premium (which could amount to EUR 300) or with a high bonus, an insurance extended to other participants of the operation, starting from the third year following the purchase of the vehicle.
"Her management is calmer and their purchase capacity is higher, so they can afford the luxury to get the highest discount", notes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to insurance against all risks with a premium (less than EUR 150) or insurance extended to other participants if a high bonus has been reached.
It should be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a valid reason for a proper study of the insurance options that would suit us most in view of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get a point on AC Milan, which means eight finals.
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to gain a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the "Champions" league, because it would mean the first to Italy and it would decide the location of the Scots.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the procedure in the fifth draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs one more to be sure that the Chessman will not get in front of him with six points, which will play with Benfika, who has four.
These two group D matches will be played a week before round six ends, since AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where the 13th in semifinal will first enter, in an effort to advance to the finals played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and the indecisive result at the Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be the most likely, even though both teams will try to fight for victory, because the Italians will not want to tactize at home and Celtic knows that after winning it would be the first and would secure a better place in the eight-final.
The Gordon Strachan's men could even lose if the Chessman doesn't win, but he can't rely on it, because at the same number of nine points the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1), but won in the first direct match (2:0).
And so the AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening of the Scots who believe they will get to the semifinals in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same match in the last goal competition Kaka's extension (1:0) after the state of 0:0 in the basic playing time.
Hope they win "rossoneri" will be a Chessman, for whom it is worth the win, only if Celtic lost, both for progress to the eight-final and for stay in UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and has no chance to continue in the highest European competition, could win a third place with one win, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert on the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
Spice Girls started their first tour in Vancouver (Canada) before 20,000 of their first tour since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their gig at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver declared that their reconnection with their group is "great".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets so that they could be present with a concert that also included a video depicting the history of this group, which caused the sensation of the late 1990s.
The return and world tour are held at the same time as the new album is released in Spain by EMI, which brings together the selection of their main success stories, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets which were given to them by the husband "Posh Spice", a British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned it a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said about the British star, "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what they think about the show."
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "for differences between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also revealed its nervousness during the meeting with journalists two hours before the start of the performance.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion changed, and the opinion of the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," she told Chisholm about the reconnection she launched nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in time "the things settled and we all love each other very much".
But a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
In the beginning, according to the CTV, the group flew into Vancouver by a special Virginia Airlines.
When they arrived, the army was expecting them at the airport.
Five has seven children in total.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), in San José (4 December) and in Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
Madrid will perform on December 23rd.
Concerns in the new gas fight between Russia and Ukraine
There is an ongoing dispute between Russia and Ukraine on gas prices, thus increasing the risk that Russian deliveries of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
The majority of Russian fuels exported to the European Union (EU) are led by pipeline through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises gas prices to Ukraine, Russia will charge higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two last year has reduced deliveries to the EU.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says that Ukraine will have to charge more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its deliveries from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries during the negotiations," said Reuters, Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinach.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit charges (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a crushing decline in exports to Western Europe, which has greatly increased prices.
The Russian gas represents one quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas supply in the world, but much of it remains underused.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply of gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian Republics.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The controller said that the Scottish NHS Chamber must improve the controls of criminal records with non-European employees.
A recommendation from President Robert Black's Supreme Audit Office came after the foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black is also worried that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the amount of foreign personnel he employs.
But his report pointed out that the other key controls were carried out correctly on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in personnel from countries outside the European Economic Area immediately after the attacks at Glasgow Airport in June.
The eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after someone drove Jeep into the main terminal building door.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a videomost accused of connecting to attempted bombings in the United Kingdom.
The NHS chambers are expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in the UK prior to his employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission is using Disclosure Scotland for criminal record checks, it has no power to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Commission should be led by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," she reported.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS was in many ways in line with its own pre-employment checks policy, but he also added: "Our report warns of areas where the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information about the number of foreign personnel."
President of BMA Scotland Dr. Peter Terry said that "very unlikely" that pre-employment controls would identify potential NHS employees who might commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that current pre-employment controls in the Scottish NHS work well and it is unclear what additional value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would probably also be higher because the Commission had a problem identifying personnel with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the established control procedures with NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
These included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the pre-employment control policy and directive for foreign NHS workers.
The Minister of Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I wanted to do this job immediately after a terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in line with the health committees, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that the best procedures appear in the updated pre-employment checks directives of all staff - including the foreign ones - which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division took over film awards
Control, a biographical film about late singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Film Award.
The prizes were also won by the star Sam Riley, who, up to the role of Curtis, worked in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and in the side role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench has been appointed the best actress behind the thriller Note about the scandal.
And the star of candy Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting the British film on the world stage.
The prizes were awarded in the Roundhouse of London.
Control describes Curtis' path to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was only £3 million.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, who was previously known for the iconic cover of the U2 Joshua Tree album, two prizes - for the best directing and best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning - because Julien Temple's film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for the best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won the Best Actress Cookie as the driver of the Russian mob boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg East Promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on hard guys' roles, won Richard Harris for the extraordinary contribution of the British film.
This 50 - year - old, such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is now filming another piece of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom of the Crystal skull.
Winstone said he was proud of this award, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great actor of my time, I'm very honored."
Independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury in which filmmakers, actors and festival organizers meet.
Among the supporters and patrons of Bif are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for a terrorist conspiracy
Yesterday, Saudi Arabia announced that it arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities and also on spiritual and security components.
The state's biggest oil exporter reported that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
The sympathizers of al-Qaeda have been campaigning against the monarchy of the United States, since 2003, from invasion to Iraq.
The TV report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner planned an attack on oil facilities in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia builds a rapid response unit with a force of 35,000 to defend equipment from the failed attack of al-Qaeda on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted an internal declaration by the Ministry: 18 arrested belonged to a cell led by an "expert on missile launch", which slipped into the country.
She also stated that the militants were planning to smuggle eight shots into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to be prepared for the murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to try more to prevent the Saudis from leaving to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Army and Shia government supported by the US, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretics.
Al-Qaid militants believe that the authorities have been copying many clergy in Saudi Arabia to support royal families that control the government.
The militants - supported by the challenges of the leader of Al-Qaeda Sauda Usama bin Ladina focused on the pro-Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort of security forces in the past... five months," said the state's internal TV spokesperson of the Ministry.
A 16-member "medial cell" was also arrested in Medina to promote "takfirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which promotes violence against Muslims identified as unbelievers and apostates.
There were also 32 people charged with providing financial support to the militants.
Climate on Venus is perhaps a sight to the future of the Earth
Yesterday, scientists announced that Venus could once have been a pleasant place for life.
Data from the current European station show that the planet is even more similar to the twofold of the earth than it had ever been thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor of the Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size and orbiting along similar paths, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that there were conditions similar to those on Earth on Venus billions of years ago, and that it could also have been a resident.
But the compressed greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower speed of rotation sent Venus on a completely different pathway.
Today the planet is waterless, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and it will be deserted by storms and winds of hurricane power.
The findings from the European Space Agency Venus Express probe, which studied the planet for one year, offer an alternate view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Oxford University of Physics Department and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission said: "It's getting more and more clear why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to build a scenario in which Venus began as well as Earth, perhaps even with the local environment, billions of years ago."
The police arrested "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was arrested yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
Police spokesperson stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000).
Still in the open
Mitt Romney said it's not worthy for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates then agreed to the debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on the video and handed them over to the candidates sent.
None of the questions on Wednesday 28 November were as comical as a snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate of the other party on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected many of the state of the Republican Party towards the next year's elections.
It is not clear how exactly CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose clips that were then shown to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the strongest Republican themes.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn the disc when they heard something comforting: the speaker recorded the summits of consent when the candidates talked about a hard approach at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who was strung forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshir.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake down the reputation of a man who was, as mayor of New York soft on an illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr Romney, accusing the former Governor of the State of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
These two fought particularly hard when the questioners asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal position and the possibility of citizenship).
The fellow candidates, like Duncan Hunter, the California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, Congressman from Colorado, were able to throw their little bit into the mill on this subject.
None of these two have a chance to nominate, but they're both in the game, perhaps, for starting to hit the alarms for immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least immigration has the same opinion: greater rigour at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with its concerns about toxic toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the contradiction between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very uncomfortable when other topics were discussed.
Mr. Giuliani has been asked why he has been supporting the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether the technique of the simulated heating should be considered torture.
One questionor asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Through it, Mr Giuliani came to the conclusion that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now opposed to all the assumptions in the recent survey in Iowa due to his long-term Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, making him laugh.
The duel remains extremely open.
Mr. Huckobe's growth in Iowa has been covering recent successes in raising money and making Ron Paul's loud cheer in the Wednesday debate.
These two bounced from the bottom because both wings of the parties still can't agree on more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with the winning report on the American size on the lips, winking on both sides.
This time, the side is split and the result is far from clear.
Labourist pains
Gordon Brown once again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary for the British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
They don't seem to be selling any orders, no bills in the hotel in Paris were mysteriously paid, no extra-marital fingers were smelled.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would do without discovering that some wealthy businessman for four years masked the contributions of the ruling Labour Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party did not announce it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided the call for elections and insulted the British intelligence by claiming that this decision had not been affected by the surveys, there was hope that it would ensure a robust and effective government.
Instead of making it more funny, the President of the Liberal Democrats, once feared Mr Brown turned from Stalin into Mr Bean.
The unscrupulous rescue of the troubled bank of Northern Rock has shown weaknesses in management and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to change the tax code brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data among 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative miscarriage.
Three retired generals started a rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested the cuts in military spending because they claimed that being a commander of armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many hundreds of gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labourists (and their former internal discipline watchman), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown will always go to his end.
Despite this, governments can reach a point of overlap, behind which they find heavy governance.
People don't believe in politicians and don't like them, but they usually withdraw their distrust if a new party takes over.
Now that it seems clear that some Prime Minister is probably not going to improve anything, and it doesn't even have to be long in the office, this is a shift away: the state administration is becoming a mess, the ministers are starting to make briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, because he cannot take the position of a new broom compared to other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the Financial Office are linked to the decisions Mr. Brown made as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in Blairian vulnerabilities, such as long investigations into the financing of political parties caused by "the rank of money", voters may feel that he was.
Yet Mr. Brown's difficulties are not as bad as they look.
Those misdemeanors aren't as terrible as conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one has died or been deluded.
And the treatment, however painful, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendency has always promised: a reliable, firm and lightly brutal government.
The latest excitement around political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he wanted no publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr Watt, who said he knew of the Abrahams procedure, but he did not know that he was illegal, would certainly be questioned thoroughly; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labourist money seeker who learned about the tricky gifts in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved yet; there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these complexes, even though the main part of the payments took place after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He very quickly condemned this violation by his own party, but diluted his decision by reaching for a proven instrument, the committee for examining this matter - led by a bishop, retired and judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complex.
If the law is broken, this is the matter of the police.
In addition, there are also other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding the Permanent President of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not had one for six months, and moving forward with a real reform of the financing of political parties.
That would require the Labourists to cooperate with conservatives and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with unions - bitter pills for a dedicated party like Mr. Brown.
But he should face some simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to win out is by far unsuspectable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the subprime mortgage crisis affect the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, naturally, the back fins are getting excited.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is outnumbered, the predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that credit card losses would be worth $99 billion if underprivileged mortgages infect other options of consumer credit.
The voltage signs are clear.
The number of cases of inability to pay back (with more than 30 days late payment) and written accounts (the accounts which the provider considers to be not enforceable) is increasing.
Last month, HSBC announced that it lost $1.4 billion on the US consumer credit market - also due to outstanding credit card loans.
However, it is still early for panic.
The written accounts and the inability to pay are still few.
According to Moody's evaluation agency 3.89% of the insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost by a whole percentage point below the average.
The deterioration rates can be partially explained by technical reasons.
The change in US personal bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcys that make a large part of the losses on credit cards; the number of reports (and hence the number of write-downs) would therefore rise regardless of whether the general conditions for the lenders have worsened.
The sector also shows a good degree of maturity, which shows how much consumers will pay out of their debts per month.
And trust in credit card collateral is solid, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Mr Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup research firm predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct routes to spread infections between subprime mortgage crises and the credit card market certainly exist: when they dry out property loans, consumers are more likely to debt through credit cards.
However, credit card publishers tend to look at the cash flow rather than the value of custodial items, so that falling house prices do not necessarily mean changing the credibility of lenders.
They can even be beneficial for lenders.
Motivation of consumers to pay mortgages goes down when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards goes up to the list of priorities to repay.
Card issuers can also react more quickly and flexibly to more stormy conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of a rapid change in the price of holding items.
"It's not going to happen that one beautiful morning we'll just re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosion in the style of subprime mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more realistic.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card sector will face a darker future.
Watch out for those back fins.
The British bankers confessed to the Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be tried for their role in fraud related to the former financial manager of the Enron Andrew Fastowe Group, changed their testimony on Wednesday and confessed guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew were originally guilty in seven fraud charges, where they and Fastow were supposed to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- get rich in the account of their employers -- they denied.
They were supposed to stand trial in January.
However, during the trial before American county judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been on the front page for the entire two years that took place in the tender procedure.
In the United States, their case is one of the outstanding parts of an investigation started after Enron's failure in 2001.
The charge against them in 2002 warned Mr Fastov that it was the objective of a government investigation into Enron's failure.
The prosecution against bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to create fraud together with Fastow and his former headman Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a partner branch of Enron controlled by Fastowe, who was the architect of a lot of enronian frauds, which sprung Enron into a spiral towards the bankruptcy announcement.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its stake in this branch with zero, but our three British knew that it was actually of considerable value.
Under Kopper's control, the company bought the bank's share of $1 million in this branch.
Incriminating bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for his share of this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow has deceptively informed Enron that the power company will pay $20 million for its share in this Greenwich NatWest branch.
But the 20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow, and others.
The bankers, according to the prosecution, received 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted in two cases a conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
The copier is in prison for three years and one month at the Texarkana facility.
All three British people were free to bail out $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the coming court.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, fell into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks had no longer been able to hide billions of debts or show failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has abolished thousands of jobs, over $60 billion of market value and over $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief manager Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the downfall of the company.
Skilling is in charge of more than twenty-four years' sentence.
The judgments on Lay for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were deleted after he died of cardiac disease last year.
Moscow’ s Non-Incompetence
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and with a sufficient volume of fuel for nonstop years from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, these are small to return.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places, because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer was sitting at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionary Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of proven consumption in a mammoth exhibition center on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers built their stand, hoping that the newly-rich Russians would lure themselves into everything from the mahoganized yachts to diamonds decorated with bulkheads to cars, for which they would not be ashamed of 50 Cent.
Mr. Fier was careful looking for a bright orange Porsche in the side booth.
"That's a nice car, but it's fivepence and dimes against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
On the waves of oil, money is paid to the Russian capital just as it was when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans got extremely rich and went to Europe where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, listener of the fourth year at Davis Center of Russian and Euro-Asian studies at Harvard.
Just as Saudi bouncers of the 1970s and Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians become the most prominent of the world's spending.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their piece on this Klondik.
At a different location in Moscow this week, the Conference of the Luxurious Industry of Donatello Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of the LVMH Group to exchange ideas about how to sell expensive goods on markets such as the Russian one.
(The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia, according to the list of the richest people, has the Forbes magazine of 53 billionaires with total wealth of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the local main institution in the field of Center for Economic and Financial Research has published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which in Russia there are 103,000 "second-order" millionaires whose assets total $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that in 2005 15.8% of the Russians lived below the limits of the existence minima.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London jewelry store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly treated, and men are all for wealth."
When they walked in the evening dresses on Sunday night by the halls, 21 - year - old Evgenia Yumatova and five - year - old Světlana Turovova described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatov, who leaned in her brand-new clothes as a veteran of the red carpets, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a home runt.
The fair seemed to be focused mainly on fresh rich people, brandly controlled Russian buyers, who are willing to sit for several hours in the road traffic so that they could pass through the warehouse, which scorching Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, roundtables custom-made, apartments in Dubai, Gund stuffers and draughts.
Free members of the public could buy tickets for EUR 30 ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft before reproduction of Rembrandt's painting from hand painted blue ducks of lifelong size.
"Of course, the Russians are more concerned with the trash."
And indeed, the local vendors say that the Russians with old money (the Russian standards are 10 to 15 years old) have moved from the flash logo to the little known signs of limited editions that would never have shown up at the shopping fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or simple tourists, flooded the trade halls every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, local bed manager King Koil, said that he sold two mattresses of silk, cashmere and cotton, intertwined with gold threads, after $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, the sales manager of A1 Moto, who features high-end cars with high-end alarms, said that his company sold a clear orange Porsche for $170 000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon he told Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, who, upon request, modified luxury cars that he sold three bars to cars in style connected chain bracelets for Rolls-Royce Puttomy for $55,000.
He showed the reporter the car wheel designed for the Russian casino owner, who had the swayed Swarov crystals so that it looked like a Roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheat-skin wheels or the portrait of his wife from the cubed zirconium, doesn't have to ride those bikes yet," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna put them in his garage by 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" at present does not mean much exclusive, given the large price increase of local real estate.
"If you bought an apartment three or four years ago in Moscow, you're probably a millionaire already, at least on paper, when not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich with a stand operated by the Alliance Continental Russian company, which deals with asset management.
The company raised four red phone booths of British style stuffed a column of counterfeit bills worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, stated that his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit bills for the Millionaires Trade Fair.
The passers stopped by to throw a pile of money around, or let their friends take pictures of themselves with a cell phone, resting in the middle of a replacement wealth, or just stuff a pocket of a few million dollars.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by a corrupt operation.
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the restaurant a little healthier and watched an ambulance that arrived at the white New English house two houses that were on West Scott Avenue.
Soon, a police patrol car joined.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the delivery of the medical examiner," said Mr Livingston, the restaurant controller.
"That's when I knew someone died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant director of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked in house 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Miss Arroy's death and hope that the toxicology tests that may not be known for weeks will help solve the mysterious death that led the Newark police to send out a wave of sadness.
Ms. Arroy was an assistant police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious, and worked hard," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr McCarthy said that Ms Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York police officer who works for the Commission for the control of alcoholic beverages, leaving behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a step-daughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the Union district, Theodore J. Romankov, said the detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroy died of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
The authorities said that they arrived at the house at approximately 3:00 p.m.
November and found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities have still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is alleged to be Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't tell me if Miss Castro's authorities had heard from her.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
In the middle of Miss Castro's house, with a ruined pink bush in the front yard and a Dalmatian barking back, nobody answered
Next to the door that led to the basement, the throneed in an open garage blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillan" - which is a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain wheels hanging on one side of the hooks.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York City Police Department 25 years later in New York, Ms. Arroy provided him with valuable assistance in biting through the unbearable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, "You should be careful about this one or this one," he said.
"She was here every time I came, and she was here every time I left.
It was embarrassing."
The Fed’s hope of reducing interest rates leads to a strengthening of world stock exchanges
Prices of shares on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market hope that the Federal Bank would attempt to calm down the lending conditions by further reducing interest rates were strengthened by the reassuring statements made by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The storms jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in order behind Ben Bernank, Chairman of the Fed, said that in response to continued pressure on financial markets, the managers must be "flexible and pragmatic".
In the context of obvious efforts to calm the irritable markets in the middle of the signs of resurrecting credit effort, Mr Kohn said that the recent insurgency "partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and October".
He also stated that if increased instability persists, the possibility of household and corporate financial conditions getting worse will be increased.
Investors consider these observations to be a signal that Fed is prepared to add additional fresh capital to the US markets, and perhaps further reductions in interest rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These notes also helped to calm Wall Street down in the middle of other bad news about the American economy when sales of apartments in October showed record low numbers.
The consequences of financial beliefs were undermined by the Bear Stearns investment bank’s announcement that it will cancel 650 jobs, which are 4 % of its world workforce, in order to reduce costs due to compensation for heavy losses caused by an unsuccessful bet on the provision of subprime housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York City, the industrial index of Dow Jones grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13 289.40, while the S&P 500 index used increased by 2.65 percent.
The London index FTSE 100 increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6,306.2, while the value of the British blue-chips increased by more than £39 billion.
The German index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets showed full strength after the European Central Bank’s three-month money package auction was loaned to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, most since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release more than standard money into London's money markets has increased, with rates of three-month UK interbank loans "Libor" rising after uninterrupted growth since 12 November at its maximum since the end of September - 6.59 percent.
England has to decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as heavy as the other.
Who's number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who is holding on to this post at the best of his time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision to help, and since Hugh Morris, the main manager of the English team, is starting to fill in applications for the post of a national collector, although not necessarily full-time.
Whoever is not built on the sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but often life is not fair and sport at all.
It is not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else will never get over the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of happiness rather than skill.
Not only in cricket is the choice demanding and requires a judgment that, in the end, must always be subjective.
Is it time Bopara moved up?
It's fair to Shah, if it does?
We could ask the same question in other areas, say John Edwards or "Tubby" Banjee, both smart young leaders with good education and an overview in the field, should be promoted to the committee - a place is only for one.
Who's supposed to say which level is right for the critics if he can't get a chance to drop or spit on the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a great influence on decision making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, the critic must catch the captain's view at the right time, if he's to take the Wicket, and the batter needs a regular chance at starting positions, if he's ever gonna make an impression as a day-old cricketer.
It's more complicated to catch the picker's view.
For example, last season was much better, which James Anderson, whose place in the first test seems to be certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as an artillery.
Anderson took 32 Wickets in first class at 33 runs for everyone.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same concise average, but they both had their moments at the highest level, hoping for more.
If he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can be just a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or finish a career of both, or it may not have a great influence.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and in the first class served good performances, five Wickets and 40 permitted runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketist, which is in addition, although in Australia he recorded twice a hundred points, possibly still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one further discussion following today's training cleanly at the stadium of Asirgya, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience over Bopar's youth.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah speaks his sparkly and valuable debuting shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in first class compared to six Bopars, who is, at twenty-two years old, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
But Shah did two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Lord's Test, his home playground in Middlesex, just ten out of the run, together with the immediate rejection of the collectors when Vaughan wanted to re-run him for the next game, his firing seems to have taken something from the elite that was so obvious in Bombay.
In contrast, the Essex universal has a joie de vivre in its bones.
Nothing scares him on the cricket field, and his behaviour outside the field symbolizes a recently turned car with a four-wheel drive on the exhibition day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He got out with minor injuries and probably a shock, but he first pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who was adversariously watching him asking, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-speed loops on local fields, which seem to suit him, distributes effectively and launches self-confidence and skillfully.
Picking the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I would like Bopara to get his chance now, which I do not want to say that Shah will not excel if, as the cello tea tickets suggest, he will be the one to play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaida
The first buses of Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive yesterday in Baghdad and to pour out refugees who ran out of money or expired the validity of visas, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some have even returned to fight with the gunmen who have driven them out of their homes.
Mansour bus station was before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy about a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned on private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaysi, Sunni doctor.
"Today I came back for what I saw on TV and what I read about in the paper because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, having in mind the Shia militia of the militant spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to break the fight.
Kasim al-Atwani, an 28-year-old Shiite teacher from the mostly Sunni region of Amaría, returned with his two children because he could no longer reinstate the Syrian visas and because the regime allowed the Iraqis to work there.
His Shiite neighbors in Amaría called him, saying that the local homeowner with the support of the U.S. Army helped push al-Qaeda out of her positions in the west of the capital, and they urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, which from his home in Sleikhu in northern Baghdad banished the grenade attack after insisting on his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"On the eve of my friends called me and told me that she was running a militia against al-Qaida at Sleikhu and that she needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have talked about the attraction of calming in the capital after strengthening the American military presence and growth of the local "group of committed citizens" which defends their neighborhood with weapons in hand by the US military.
But more was the fact that they were forced to return by the obstructions around visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a ten - year - old father of three children, spoke out loudly suspected among refugees that Núri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian Government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas and to force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"All was fine before Al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq," said the Sunni retired.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left."
The partial reason for weakening violence is that the Sunnis were pushed out of Shia and vice versa, which in many places reduces tension.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees is reassuring sectarian tensions and leading to another struggle.
Little Sarah, good education
Germany's smallest federal country plays a leading role in vocational education, and it even excels in international focus of its universities.
In one area of education, Sarah is concerned about the same scarcity as the rest of Germany.
"A man who does not come from Sarsk yesterday I explained to him after 50 years that we are not French" - this self-shironical password appears on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal country.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
The universities have traditionally been cooperating closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a reasonably high share of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an over-average number of Sarah's children are admitted to college - many of them and without a high school degree.
"The training system is used in Sarsk", says Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert of IW.
More than every fifth youth gets permission to study at a vocational school, Sarah is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sarah to combine practical and academic education.
The possibility to study two fields is the second best in all of Germany, given the number of inhabitants.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of graduates of engineering has decreased by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Sarah has now ordered universities to create a promotion campaign on engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pisa, we conducted several reforms at general education schools," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to learn as soon as possible, the last year of maternity school is free - a model that also takes over other federal countries.
If the results of the pupils are significantly improved, they will show up to future comparative studies.
In the implementation of the Pisa study in 2003, the proportion of risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20 %.
But, in total, Bulgaria has not improved as much as other federal countries.
The Bavarians can count better.
And to disappointment Sarah's study Pisa does not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sarah could score in this area.
The language of the neighbors is mandatory at the high school - although the inhabitants of Sarsko are not French.
Chávez moves the clock
We'll have hours in Venezuela in no time but the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will have the hour shifted back in this South American country by half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez becomes a ridiculous figure in Spain.
Venezuela's official letter informed us that the hours of the new law against world time will shift by less than four and a half hours.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chávez, the enemy of the United States, justified his decision, inter alia, by forcing the United States to divide the time zones throughout the hours.
On the middle of local time, Chávez also announced that he was interrupting relations with neighboring Colombia because of a hostage case.
This left-wing nationalist stated that until the conservative Alvaro Uribe president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the Colombian government.
"I can no longer because of my self-respect," said Chávez, who advocates the reform of the Constitution, which the citizens of this oil country must vote on in Sunday referendum.
Chávez would have strengthened his power in the country with this reform.
The fight caused Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with the Marxist rebels on the release of hostages.
Uribe criticized Uribe Chávez on Sunday by Venezuela's decision " spit in the face".
In Spain, too, everyone's talking about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone here triggered a riot: "Port quoé no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet anymore?) - so is the sentence that has already been downloaded from the Internet by more than half a million people.
It was spoken by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who, at the recent Ibero-American summit, was so upset by this leftist populist that he had silenced him in this way.
Germany is in danger of paying lower wages in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are in danger of reducing real wages this year, despite the strong balance.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees can actually count on them to get lower wages in 2007 than last year.
"The guilt carries a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy," said Bild Gustav Horn of the research institute IMK (Institut für Macroökonomie und Konjuncturforschung).
The new burden on employees may also be waiting in the area of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that for the new year the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency would no longer be able to fall into such difficulties that the federal youth must require loans or contributions, quoted the newspapers of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was published that the price explosion of food and petroleum products has driven inflation to its highest state in the last 13 years.
In the year-on-year comparison, prices increased by three percent overall.
Venus is a hell of a twin Earth
Despite its life’s hostile atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar than previously assumed. European space probe Venus Express on Venus has experienced phenomena that occur in the winter also on Earth: lightning in the atmosphere and windwinds in the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have known that Venus has been glowing.
Now the European probe Venus Express brought evidence - it captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus fly lightning from clouds to clouds at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, wrote in the science magazine Nature Christopher Russell of California University in Los Angeles.
According to the known theory of the formation of primary matter, life was created on Earth thanks to lightning. The storms allegedly caused reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
On Venus it was not: "If there ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, something alive would hardly be found on the surface of Venus. Atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"The outdoors may be the hell of a twin Earth, but it is a twin," said Russell.
Why did Venus, which is so much like the Earth, start to develop completely differently, is the basic issue of Esa's mission.
Since no probe has been sent since the early 1990s exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in this planet’s research.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which brought together several articles of Nature, did not only stress the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They have also shown that our neighboring planet is more like the Earth than it has ever been thought," said Esa.
In addition to the already known winds at the north pole, scientists found a cloudy vortex at the south pole that spins much faster.
This phenomenon resembles the air currents on the northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by the Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Instituto di Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of our solar system is almost the same matter as the Earth, and with a diameter of 12 100 km is almost as big.
This planet, known as the Jitřenka or the Evening, will be orbiting the Sun in almost 225 days.
One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus, at a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bar Earth, does not remind scientists of the fact that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
However, on Earth, it remained in the oceans, while from Venus it vanished into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound to carbonate on Earth, Venus makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
The Federal President of Köhler requires the termination of party disputes because of the acceptance of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellor's Office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and calls for a large coalition to end the party around the Dalai Lama's acceptance.
"We should not present ourselves on the outside as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler said to the economic newspapers of Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to adopt the Dalai Lama in September.
"Though I respect cultural differences, human rights are universal to me," Köhler said.
Although the Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not prevent it from being stopped by the Merkels when they were told that it was creating a new policy for China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not left the traditional Single China policy.
China also knows," Köhler said.
The Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly showed his disapproval of the Dalai Lama, and was therefore attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the "pretentious" foreign coalition policy.
Following the adoption of the Dalai Lamas at the Chancellor's Office, German-China relations have worsened.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to information from SPIEGEL, it also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries.
The Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that accepting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve of the fact that European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed the position of China.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet and other Tibetan regions that are also in the territory of China are trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar unrests that broke out in France
Street fights with police, gunfights, hot cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar unrests that broke out in France.
We must do all we can to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow in the violence on the street, calls on the Federal Minister of Interior.
The barricades were burning, the outlaws were shooting shotguns at the police. After serious youth riots in France, the Federal Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany as well.
"We must be careful not to create such social tensions that break through violence.
We need to take this seriously," he said in the Hanover newspaper, Neue Presse.
I'm told that not every young person can cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The Federal Government, the countries and municipalities are already working hard to eliminate the problems, said Schäumble.
Which does not mean only the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, we have recorded the first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In the past nights, youths and police in the northern suburbs of Paris fought hard street fighting.
Even in Toulouse, there were cars and public buildings.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were required by the President of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "implication effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as it is in France.
Even so, it should be done.
The circle pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who came from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "excessively high".
In particular, more learning opportunities must be provided.
The colate stressed: "We must give youthful hope."
However, the President of the Turkish municipality added that, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Moreover, many youths from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
The wheel urged, "We must continue to pay attention."
We need to allow young people to start working and to learn."
Meanwhile, the night remained in the Paris suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel mostly calm.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter with headlamps flew over the area.
The authorized authorities reported three arrests and several burnt-out garbage baskets and cars.
Since yesterday, approximately 1,000 forces of order have been put on hold.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, after visiting the suburbs of the Home Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie.
Some 80 police officers were injured in riots in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The following night, the riots of Toulouse were engulfed.
The mess caused a Sunday traffic accident in which two youths lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the D.A., the police are not guilty of murder of juveniles.
In Angela's "Clouds" realm
The Chancellor's remote output shows that the coalition is at the end and that we cannot expect anything more from it alone.
What country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After her relentless, indifferent sounding and content-rich speech at the general debate of the Polish Chamber, we must state: not here - not in this country that she is supposed to manage after all.
The regret that she was focusing too much on foreign policy has once responded to Angela Merkel with a very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, showing her she doesn't want to understand what the critics are up to.
In the Federal Chamber, she demonstrated to everyone how much she deserved the regret.
From Merkel, he did not feel a real interest, let alone a feeling for problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblaková" was presented: a politician who excels over others who flee to foreign politics and there is only murky expression.
For example, climate protection: it praises itself without ceasing the conclusions of the Heiligendam summit, but it no longer says how the climate objectives are to be achieved in Germany.
And in any case, such self-governing - so much inaccuracy would have been forgiven by the president of the CDU two years ago.
Now it's limited to a false phrase that might increase her likeness amongst people.
With this approach, it harms its imija pragmats, which do not need flattery because they solve problems.
But in Angela's "Clouds" realm, the internal political problems are marginal matters.
Child poverty and the worries of people with low wages?
She has a few side sentences on these subjects.
It is worth noting how often the Merkels, when it comes to child allowances, are reciting.
Three times Merkel must start from the beginning in order to manage to speak at least partially the right sentence.
As soon as things start to get too specific, they stumble like in a completely foreign terrain.
Attack Department
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates for Youtube is being discussed in the case of the favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney in the intense debate - and they must now be afraid of the outsider candidate.
The tensions of both candidates are already reflected in the first topic.
Mitt Romney throws out his opponent Rudy Guiliani that he made New York "a refuge for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp regrets: "I believe his own house was just one such refuge," he answers and claims to former Governor Massachusetts that he privately employed immigrants without proof.
The candidates are being attacked. Since the Republican base has not yet had a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates at CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute Internet users filmed and sent videos through Youtube serve as only such clues to a key topic.
"We have enabled Hitler to take power precisely such a policy of isolationism," says John McCain to his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one who advocates the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam’s veteran McCain does not spare Romney with his regrets, for refusing to condemn the torture method called Waterboarding, in which heating is simulated.
The reaction of the audience in St Petersburg, Florida, shows that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are important issues of the campaign.
The audience will burst in applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
So it turns out where the weakness of the two favorites lies.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney cleavagely and asks the party base and the television audience to forgive for his promotion of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to express itself to the literal interpretation of the Bible.
The Musharraf first ruled in civilization
The day after his resignation from the position of Chief Commander of the Army, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf took a presidential oath.
That ends eight years of military government in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Parvíz Musharaf took a presidential oath on Thursday, and it will continue for another five years in the presidential office.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharaf swore that he would honor the constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
In the middle of his office, the commander-in-chief handed over to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, subject to international pressure, especially by the US.
Eight years after he took power in a bloodless military coup, the former General ruled for the first time as the Civilian Head of State.
Musharraf met one of the main requirements of the opposition and the West by withdrawing from the position of Chief Commander of Armed Forces.
Another central requirement is the cancellation of the exceptional state declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Chief Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayum, Musharraf will soon withdraw the emergency after his oath, thus fulfilling further requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf, following the announcement of an exceptional status at the beginning of November, held him in favor of the lawyers, rejected all objections concerning the contested re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed during the attack on a military convoy in the North Vaziristan tribal area and four others were injured.
The military spokesperson said the bomb went off on the road near the Afghanistan border.
Father's Krautrock Returns
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia Group took over their electronic synthesizers at the Berlin concert.
The Revival will also include Live 1974, cut from the most successful period of the band.
They were already more famous abroad.
The famous sensation then lies in the performance of three settled gentlemen who at first look like they're just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables, and especially buttons.
Three-seven-year-old Dieter Moebius sitting in a snowy and white shirt in the middle.
On his left, there's a seventy-seven-year-old Michael Rother with a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Three-seventy-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is focused on synthesizers, is from the viewer's point of view to the right.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even beats.
Some of them, certainly a lack of perception, will create a traditional composition.
Seems like it's too cool with the musicians' masters.
Among the lovers of Krautrock, Harmonia's revitalized a great deal of excitement.
One thing is worth noticing. Repeated questions have shown that although this name is part of a collective awareness of pop, it is certainly not enough that someone has been missing this band for twenty-three years.
But why couldn't a German celebrate his still living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when you get a musical style, the mistakenly called Krautrock, England and America, they value more than in their own country.
When in 2003 he awarded the Can Prize for Life to the remaining members of the Can Group, the hall was full of questionable views of German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! groups in their speech, the audience no longer knew the limits.
Michael Rother later sat on the stage as his old friend at Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The problem of ignorance at home and worshiping abroad is one thing.
Remembering the Harmonia band, we overestimated the memory, this trio existed for just two years, and at that time it did not have the same influence that others later added.
Moebius and Roedelius have been playing with an artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first, they played in the cellar of the Berlin Theatre of Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for a turntable company run by the church.
Roth briefly helped with the Kraftwerk group, but gained a reputation as a guitarist at the Neu! band, which at that time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the band Cluster until exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, the ruin of the 16th century, lived as members of the communal who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius could yet loathe as a nanny.
It was more of a life in such a Spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for the given art is allegedly derived from the name of the choir of the singing Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was found in the trash can.
Many of this has been preserved by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music by Harmonie" and the following was "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Collecting roses did not just serve self-recognition.
The "Live 1974" CD was now released at a concert in Griessem in front of a record small, only 50-membered round.
Rother then expressed his wish that the members of Harmonie should be trained and trained occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebia, it was a completely indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced its breakup.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere, and he insured his future with the album "Smoking Heart".
Cluster's band came back to life in the 1980s, and since then it's been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for her live album from Griessemer.
His recording company Grönland took care of Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedeli's solo work at that time.
The resurrection of Harmony will take place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
The present will be Brit, Julian Cope, an old punk and author of the book "Krautrock Sampler".
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will participate.
So we drew a whole spread of the impact of the Krautrock on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled in by Harmonia.
Brian En's voice accompanied by the strangest sounds is said in the hall: "The unique true music is the future."
There are paintings where the producer of Harmonia is in the agricultural seat.
It also contributes to creating legends to projecting other black and white photographs, where there are a set of instruments that are wildly connected cables.
Three veterans were once again employed by improvisation.
Not any more by polishing the organ and drum microphones to pry out of the tools, never the unheard of self-manufactured tones.
Electronic music today looks like electronic music.
Three to the posse-breaking technique.
There is no change in the congregation of the House of World Cultures.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place she emphatically sings "Aaaaa!
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would have found roots rather than in blues at the music universities (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever screams "'68' at this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia is not going to let himself be left alone.
Even the most self-evident of all is thoroughly considered on the stage.
Where does music start and when end?
This question of man either loses his nerve or gives him the opportunity to experience passing moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With the introduction of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, there were two films about the war in the Balkans.
But neither one of them is convincing.
The film design either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or it's too touching.
The Hunting Party doesn't even stop an actor like Richard Gere.
The good news first is that war criminals Karadid and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the dark background of the Bosen War, actor Richard Gere will be fine.
We have recently lost sight of this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he played in many lovely, unsanctioned roles in cool women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, people will take the desire for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become a prey (Why must the names of the films today be so long and tangled?).
Gere gives a magical performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically who Gere could become if fate and film industry weren't so merciful: a man who has long over his best years, but still remains as a wreck like a memorial with a certain remarkable charm.
But despite this trumpet, The Hunting Party is along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the cinemas this week, just a continuation of the endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who saves a Serbian girl from a kosovský sniper, and one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that Serbs are not presented as the cause of all evil, this TV record film is changing too soon in shooting and action.
There's gonna be something very similar to the Kobru 11 series, even without a freeway, but for the war.
On The Hunting Party, you can clearly examine why the Balkan War has not yet been able to make a really good film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who go for the "Lish", a Serbian high war criminal, could, at a different time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (both Richard Shepard) may become a new "Apocalypse".
For both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that is not capable of the army, but their way will become the way to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the rotten and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, he will also have a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnia Muslim.
The film The Hunting Party can finally write back after the reporters in the last five fast minutes of the film have succeeded in doing what NATO, the CIA, and all the criminals of the world have failed over the last five years: to catch the criminals and leave him to the righteous revenge of the Bosnia Muslims.
This is so against the logic of film creation that it would be worth turning to the International Court of Hague.
This film has a deep human message.
This condemns the fact that Karadid and Mladić are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (they are exceptionally united here) that they do not commit themselves to persecution in a very intense way on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women will attack us with the famous poem of Brecht.
In it it is the wooden mask of the Asian demon on the work table of the writer: "I look with compassion at the overflowing veins at the forehead, noticing: how hard it is to be mean."
In films like The Hunting Party, they perform exactly as hardheaded heads, but they suggest how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the war in the Balkans.
Recently, these newspapers reported that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were major failures.
One thing to add is that no good film about South Africa has ever been made.
Almost always applies: When a star wanders through a crisis area or walks through a minefield, a film like Rangoon and Patricia Arquette, the Borders of the Break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprie will arise.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close to time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler List.
Many films may have to mature - films that are now considered to be classic Vietnamese works - "Apocalypse", "Apocalypse" or "The Lead vest" - were not celebrated at any time as master's works.
But maybe today, when every mass murder comes home immediately on two screens, we know too much about this world's conflicts.
And then the scenarioors don't have the ability to tell stories that's right.
"To be or not to be" or "Big dictator" have become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know in a terrible way how the Nazi regime actually ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe he has to create a sarcastically measured artistic view as Lawrence Norfolk's novelist.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprièr's Dictionary" and "Balkan War", he said: "The likeness lies only in the fact that some things never change.
The cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust harvests criticism for refusing the Olympics
The mayor's resignation from organising summer Olympic games in Hamburg has come up with a sharp criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the organisation of games by the water.
But Von Beust encourages realism in an estimate of chances.
The Chief Agent of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday marked this decision "from the point of view of business as unfortunate".
No other project has recently awakened as much motivation in the city as the Olympic thought.
"Without this objective, it would not be possible to maintain this sport-like political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but he created a new long-term concept for him, "based on a revised schedule."
The mayor of Ole von Beust remained unrealistic at the heart of his earlier statements, according to which the Hamburg Olympic ambitions are at least until 2028.
"No Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on the Olympic candidacy", said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that, at the beginning of December, the Sports Union will decide on the candidacy of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preferences for us means that we have no realistic chance with a time plan of 2028."
Yet this dream is not over, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) called von Beust's statements regrettable.
It makes Hamburg feel like she doesn't want to go for the next 20 years about the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to destroy your chance by marking the plans at this early stage as buried," said President HSB, Günter Ploss.
It would be contrary to the statement by the head of the Senate at the General Assembly of the German Higher Education Union.
Von Beust here announced the Hamburg candidacy at the Universals in 2015 as a substitute for organising the Olympic Games.
Only in the last week did the Hamburg High School Sports nominee for a candidate city.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg Senate noted that it was wasting valuable time that could be used to build flats in Hamburg.
"The development of Klein Grassbrook was stopped by the Senate for years because he had bet on organizing the Olympics and building the flats," said SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While SPD for Klein Grassbrook still planned the Olympics, with the entire area later being used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously put on the "Olympic Factor".
Negotiation about the 2012 Summer Olympic Games caused great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's boxes.
Whoever joins Sweden and wooden boxes doesn't think of Andy Warhol, but Ike.
Do I?
The wooden boxes currently produced in Sweden cast dark shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of it on the list of the ninety-four Stockholm boxers are falsifiers.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" several months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo Boxes" from 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm came with the result of the disillusionment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 the Museum of Modern Museet donated to his former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - as well as most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of Stockholm, which are on the international artistic market in circulation.
The previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes that were based on the red-momented design of the Brillo soap powder paper boxes.
The exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968 demonstrated - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from Brillo factory.
It wasn't about art works, it was about their designs, just show pieces.
Warhol probably also gave permission in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo boxes in Sweden, but they are not exposed in Moderna Museet.
The then witnesses now speak of fifteen boxes that were legally entered into artistic and auction history as originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the name Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 approximately a hundred boxes were manufactured in Sweden, which Warhol left him.
In fact, 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St Petersburg only in 1990.
Warhol was dead three years ago.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator of Moderna Museet, examined, in addition to six Brillo boxes, which are owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after being painted with a basic color and bevelled, they were brushed with a white paint.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies showed that color was applied directly to the transceiling plate without the previous basic paint - and it is also an acrylic and not an oil colour.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo Boxing list," said Director Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If Andy Warhol Art Authority Board in New York does not have any other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from his exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies".
Already in July, the Authority Board announced that it would deal with these "basic accusations" that were raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
However, the organization is still in permissive silence.
The rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had joined a hotel in Manila and demanded President Gloria Macapagal Arroy's resignation.
The leader of the insurgents Antonio Trillanes, who evicted the president's manipulation and corruption in the election, told the hotel reporters that he was rejecting the responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers dedicated to the government had previously attacked with the deployment of tear gas at the hotel.
A few hours earlier, about two tens of soldiers were in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were in court because of an attempted coup in 2003, Trillanes was among them.
He used the negotiations to escape with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police who were supposed to guard him apparently ran over to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and requested the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The authorities of the loyal unit have closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president has called for an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the act of soldiers.
"People have had enough," said Triallnes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite unit Scout Rangers said that further troops will be joining the march shortly.
Government critics called for a major demonstration to take place on Friday against the president.
For months her government has been blamed for corruption.
Manil financial area has already become the main scene of the rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroy in 2003.
As the rebels refused to join the army, the rebellion failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, the Philippines have tried to overthrow a democratically elected government at least seven times.
