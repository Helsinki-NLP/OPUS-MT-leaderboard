The Strategy of the Republican Party against Obama Re-Election
Republican leaders have justified their policy of the necessity to fight electoral fraud.
Brennan’s centre, however, calls such fraud a myth that electoral fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who will die after lightning.
In the last ten years only 300 cases of electoral fraud have been recorded by Republican lawyers in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US has responsibility for the organisation of federal elections by individual states.
And in this spirit, most US governments have since 2009 declared new laws that make the election process more difficult or difficult to write to the electoral list.
This phenomenon saw a boom following the elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states arrived.
As a result, 180 proposals were submitted for 2011 alone by law restrictive electoral law in 41 countries.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the election periods in advance, invalidate the right to enrol in the electoral list on the day of the election and withdraw the electoral right to citizens registered in the criminal register.
Before the elections in 2006, no U.S. state required an ID card to be presented at the voters.
The first country to introduce this request was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indian law was confirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2008.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this procedure to other countries.
Over the last two years, they have supported the proposals of such laws in 34 states with the aim of forcing voters to present their photo ID cards.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identification cards, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, it does not own 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of the age to vote, any photo ID issued by the government of their state.
Furthermore, it does not have such an ID card of about five million new voters in 2012.
Moreover, the purchase of the required identity card often costs more than $100.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young, minority and low-income people.
25% African-Americans, 15% under $35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters to be attached to democratic candidates are not entitled to use their photo ID card issued by their school in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who prefer to vote for Republican candidates to use cards issued by these clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no State required a document on citizenship at the elections.
Arizona introduced the first such request.
Since 2011, about 12 countries have adopted laws that require voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at reducing the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It is necessary to note that two of the three Hispanics prefer a democratic party.
The Republican legislators in 2011 supported laws in eight countries that interrupt the minutes of voters on the day of the elections.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the general elections in 2004, campaigns for recording voters helped to register around 10 million people.
However, the measures adopted after 2009 caused a 17% decline in the recording of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted laws aimed at shortening the election period in advance in the next five countries.
For example, during the general elections of 2008 in Florida, African-Americans accounted for 33% of the voters who voted ahead, although African-American voters in this country were only 13%.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They were only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting ahead.
On the other hand, the white people who represented 76% of all the voters were only 46% of the voters who voted ahead.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters opposed the approval of laws that limit the registration of voters.
Democratic governors have blocked several draft laws with their veto.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, he even hit the U.S. Attorney General.
They partially managed to reduce the damage.
For example, 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
However, the new rules will make the exercise of voting rights quite undeniably difficult in 2012.
The democratic critics mainly talk about the prejudices of the approved laws and consider them a clear attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in the key states.
The 2011 report of Brennan’s Centre shows that the states where these laws were approved represent 171 out of 270 votes in the electoral group necessary for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too early to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is clear today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Revealing prostate cancer: passing an examination or not?
The PSA test led to poor results which were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, resulting in unnecessary medical procedures.
All of this has increased the weightlessness of men who have already been so reluctant to investigate at all.
To get investigated or not?
We've requested two experts' views.
Studies in the USA have shown a high level of contamination among the individual groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and to deliver valuable recommendations.
Another study, European this time, found a difference in mortality among patients who had undergone an examination and those who did not.
This study also demonstrated after 12 years of separation that those who do not go to examination have a 30-40% higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend an examination from 50 years of age or from 40 years of age if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also more dangerous groups.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is exposed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and species that are insensitive.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus in these cases rather on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not being treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten them.
Rather, we will offer them active supervision and, in the event of disease progression, will offer them treatment.
More and more precisely, we set criteria that help to decide which type of treatment and which is not.
Still, I suggest you take the exam.
However, it is important to have an interview with your doctor and to determine whether or not it is appropriate to have an examination.
In cooperation with the International Urological Company, the Movember movement has created a tool that allows evaluation for and against the PSA examination.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the best means of reducing the risks of disease is to adopt the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate and moved healthy enough, it would be possible to avoid up to 30% of cancer cases.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian cancer research company.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the cancer disease causes hereditaryity.
A percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For a Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, although the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It's extremely bad for human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers still in Quebec today," spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of halved cancer deaths.
Weight
Isolation and obesity are, according to the SCC, another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophageal, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," reports the report.
Nutrient
It also recommends reducing the consumption of red meat.
If too high a consumption occurs, there may be an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid also the sows for which the same applies.
Conserving meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to cancer development," adds the report.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the connection between vitamins supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet made clear conclusions.
The studies focused on vitamin E are inconsistent according to the SCC.
Although one of them suggests that there will be a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, other studies refer to an increase in prostate cancer.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu insists on how important it is to talk about his fears and family precedents with his doctor.
"Creating an examination doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs boson examined
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' boson caused a legitimate start last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And it is also the last particle whose existence predicts a standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - which has not yet been empirically observed.
But there is no 100% certainty among physics that it is Higgs' boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to Higgs' boson, as predicted by a standard model.
New data published this week during a major physical congress in Kyoto confirm it rather, but there is still no data to be able to be absolutely sure.
However, suppose it's Higgs' boson, because the risk of a mistake seems small, and let's see what it is.
There is a completely unquestionable law in this world, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard or you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quartz" state - this "stand" roughly creates some of their properties.
It also divides physics particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, or fermiones, who obey Pauli's principle.
And at the other end, there are bosons, mean anarchists who appreciate nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can still be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (outstandingly amazing), which is The Partial Adventure, in Berkeley's labs: the mesons that we leave here unnoticed, and the "power particles" that spread great natural forces and with which Higgs' boson is probably related in some way.
It must be said, however, that these bosons are not as exotic as they might be supposed to be.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: photon, or "part of light", which is the "bearer of electromagnetic force".
When particles with electric charge accelerate or change their direction, they "disruple" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "interference" will create an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but photon - and thus one of the bosons, "bearers of power".
A more stable field
It's also with Higgs' boson, except the difference is that "disruple" is required another field, Higgs' field to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excitation it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, as with frozen pond levels, it is now only very large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge parts accelerator as an accelerant in the CERN laboratory - a large ragon accelerator with helpful volumes is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogies with the electromagnetic field are again useful to clarify the relationship between Higgs and mass.
With electromagnetic field, neither all particles nor all materials react.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - for example, a piece of paper will never keep itself on the refrigerator.
And they don't react all the particles with Higgs' field: the ones that do have a certain mass, while the others (such as photon, let's look at it) don't have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks what all these research is for, what do they bring us?
From the point of view of science it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any non-conformity between observations and forecasts of MS.
In addition, few physicists literally wish that they could be found because the slightest difference could open the space of "new physics" and fill some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model has enormous shortcomings so far, does not provide any explanation of gravity (outside!) or dark matter, which accounts for approximately 80% of space matter (once!).
However, the CERN has not yet revealed such a conflict.
Responses
The responses of this research in the daily life of Mr and Mrs Novák can only be predicted very difficult, but the mistake would be to think that there will be no one.
See, at the very beginning of the 1960 ’ s, the pioneers of the laser labs in Bell’s labs had no idea of the revolution that would cause their work.
They assumed scientific applications, but nothing else.
Physics Willard Boyle - who worked at the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous rays were pulsed) in 1962, I have it already said - the laser was initially considered such a "toy toy to the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, application can also be derived from all instruments that surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle didn't plan it at all at first, now serves as a "c" of all digital cameras in the world and gave him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that activities around LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it means that you never really know...
Palliative Care - The best way to get out of life...
Through his Commission for the Dignity of Death, Quebek recently took up sensitive questions regarding the end of his life.
The debate should continue shortly and, at the same time, the bill is being proposed.
There is still a lot of work left to do in this crucial area.
Le Devoir tried to look more closely at this question.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterégie.
The prostate cancer that ingested him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life, and it's already seven years," he says without emotion on his bed in a palliative care house Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: the enormous weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
He rezignovally looks at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, and he talks to the unsubs who stop by, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
Courage to ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhoea, it humiliates me," he confesses.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In all my life, one learns that men urinate," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to child stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"depends on the abilities of the man" whether he's going to accept the return, says the psychologist.
In the opinion of a number of people who care for palliatively, essential moments are taking place in the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter home with palliative care of Victor-Gadbois suffer all cancer.
Their prognosis is no more than three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide them with so-called "treatment" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear of dying is to be suffocated with full consciousness.
But the disease enabled me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he says.
"I don't have any more wishes in my life," she says, and then she says, "and then she's going to let us put on a breathing device.
Yet, he is still enjoying his last visit from Italy in the following days.
At Victor-Gadbois home, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, the care of the body is provided with the help of nutrition.
That's what palliative care looks like, which is happening if there's nothing else you can do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québek there is one bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all gonna die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether physical, emotional or spiritual comfort is involved.
When a person dies, he can be given a touch of brandy or peppers, according to his taste.
Diabetics may not be able to control their sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
They carried Mr. X's beer last night, who died later last night.
He'll finish his son's beer this morning in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, head of care services.
At Victor-Gadbois' home, days after days go by each other, but they don't look like each other.
In addition to a 39-year-old man who rejoices in the last encounter with his family, thoroughly based on pillows, while they toast to his honor, a man who dies tragically 16 years old surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after trying all the possibilities to survive.
"There have always been three to five beds for up to 45 people with cancer for six months," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of those who come to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their homes and 47% come from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is intended to relieve suffering once the sick reach the final stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Grand Montréal Society for home palliative treatment, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And this fundamental inaccessibility of health care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors specialising in palliative care fear the adoption of the euthanasia law and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifesto has been signed by the peaks in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they confirm their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the queb medical system is not sufficiently efficient to ensure access for all to quality palliative care before it can be agreed with euthanasia.
As she says, she has recently experienced a patient who has spent 14 days in an emergency in huge pains without anyone taking the necessary steps to make her feel better.
He fears that patients should not be asked to die because they do not have proper care.
At the same time, a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last few moments, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
The hopes of survival of Hélène Richards were already minimal when she left the difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologists that I was done with treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was no longer fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when a team of palliative cunts eased their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Moneyau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Society, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives to sleep the patient until the moment of the end, whether at a time of impact or whether the sedatives are administered permanently.
It cannot be seen that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
The patient we don't get rid of the pain will have an ever greater opportunity to access palliative sedatives.
The sick, who are not given sedatives, always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't always necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I want you to get rid of my pain."
The implementation of this report has made it possible for journalists to receive a grant from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of travel management, contractors in construction and public works, lobbyists of political parties and experts in the Italian mob still tell what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unions and mobs are involved.
This "sector" came the queb tax taxpayers very expensive in particular between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has been crushed since we took major measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, the Quebian Member and former Head of Police in Montreal.
He broke out a scandal in 2011, based on a thorough investigation into the embezzlement of funds in connection with road construction contracts in Quebec, which was approved by Prime Minister Jean Charest after a long time.
The "Duchesneau Report" confirmed the direct link between industry, the opaque financing of parties and the corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the 2010 investigation," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport saved a billion dollars on orders," when some people held their instincts to win their share in them!
Charbonneau's committee "has already led to the demise of two mayors," adds with the hope that she will manage to "spread the lewdness of some people".
Permanent unit for the fight against corruption founded in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
Moreover, police officers of the Marteau types, who since 2009 ensured that the Montreal "card of money" significantly mitigated the inflation of contracts...
In recent weeks, they've done a number of tours and charged with fraud and corruption with a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one municipality in the suburbs.
Another on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his duties as mayor of Laval, the third largest Quebeck city.
He's suspected that he repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have also been received by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito created a sensation by explaining to the Commission the "system" mechanism of purchasing public contracts.
He himself devoted 3% of the value of the contracts he had obtained in Montréal to a mob middleman who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal, for which he ran for mayor Gérald Tremblay.
After 2000, he was generous on all sides and devoted more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to liberals who were in power at that time.
He also admitted that he had organised an illegal search for finance for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money pipelines, whose prices he has placed
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was very clear.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him in a very detailed way before the commission: within ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and allowance totalling 736 000 dollars in exchange for contracts with money pipelines in which he awarded the prize.
Other public figures from the transport sector admitted that they had paid their remuneration for 30% to 40% overestimating invoices through false multi-work.
The mayor's party organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of keeping his eyes on the parallel budget that brought dirty money into his register.
On the basis of these revelations, Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, thereby throwing Montréal into a vast crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal Members to give a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, since 2010, he has been competing against the sale of the municipal land bought for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the middle of a thriving real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally begin, says that "he pulls strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of ant system to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
According to her, the trial is "past but positive".
We are at the wound cleaning stage, but it is necessary to establish our own investigation unit in Montréal and to ensure that these questionable practices cannot come back.
Like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have alienated hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is especially concerned about the roles of "consultants informed of this lsa", unless they have become soaked in these chakras!
It estimates that 70% of Quebek's funding for election campaigns comes from dirty money, and irony adds, "I hear it's just a weak reflection of reality."
The Quebek government proposes to limit donations to $100, but it does not solve the situation: "until the electoral expenditure is strictly limited, the dirty money from politics will not disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the public procurement and funding system of the parties: "We can no longer fall; if we focus courageously on the substance of things, we can build again on firmer foundations and with greater control and compliance with laws."
If this story has blackened the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends to all those who laugh at him to look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you and the PSG have set up a completely new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other, or by the completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players came to us.
Every day I get next to them.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier at games.
Things are going so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in preparation at INF Clairefontaine to transfer to Saint-Etienne I have always shifted by individual degrees.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
The reinforcements of this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And from this it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for a game and wants to submit maximum performance.
And in addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the technicians.
Today, in the 1st league, he is not equal and is one of the best European trainers.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's got a lot of titles with the top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
I had a relaxing conversation with him in January.
I had a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our lead.
But we're staying in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the League of Masters: we have made it very easy to advance to the 8th final.
What's your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a hard opponent for quality European teams.
We want first to win our qualification group in front of Port so we can play eight finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
In order for Paris to become a big European club, it has to win titles and enter into history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, the PSG has the means to make this plan happen.
And would it be a great failure not to win in the 1st league as in last season?
Of course, that would be great disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We've missed it a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Usually with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had the season even more amazing.
I think it's gonna work out this year.
Even though large teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are pursuing the title, I think we have weapons at our disposal to defeat them.
Do you think PSG media expect too much?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us given what has been invested and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's the fact that if we beat Troys 4:0 at home, and there's still something in the paper that's not very pleasant.
You ask what other people want from you.
Of course, you can't win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In Liza's masters, we've proven that we know how to play.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't fought till the eighth finals since the second season, and they've also invested big amounts!
Given the amount invested, you could expect to have a head start in front of the other 15 points!
That insults the other clubs and the French League.
Lyon and Marseille clubs, which failed too much last season, have moved to the next phase with the new PSG.
That shows how amazing the 1st league is.
I hope we can smile in May and say that despite all the difficulties we have managed to win.
It seems that the PSG has everything to do with Zlatan Ibrahimovich's performance.
It's good to say there's a "dependence on Zlatan."
That means that Ibrahimovich is very powerful and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here to prove to be the star of the 1st league.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
On our team we respect man and player.
Even he respects the people he's got around him.
What he's accomplished is truly exceptional.
This has led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow next to each other.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French representation?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately for the injury, I couldn't play the way I thought I would.
But I've been through it, and I've come out stronger.
Today, I am also able to play good games in the representation.
That's what I've hoped for since I joined the representation.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be exemplary in our performance.
How are you looking at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the National Team?
They're talking about the results.
We're in a good position to qualify for MS.
Coach chooses strictly, he's close to the players, and he's got a chance to be excited about winning.
That's how Laurent Blanc was.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the tie (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This fight has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have not experienced such a fight for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
In addition, as is often true in these technologies, there is a clear political perspective: the belief that the existing financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (but transferable to dollars, euro...), as well as a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between pairs of partners.
With 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The Bitcoin course first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to $2, today it moves at the limit of about $10 (the exchange rate overview is given on the page bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to world exchange for real money or financial products, it's nothing impressive.
Yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is still interested in this fact in its report on virtual finances, which was published in October.
Bitcoin calls it "the most successful virtual money", "the competing dollar and the euro" and "the current money period".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money by being used as "credits" for the procedure in a video game that you get by playing or which you can buy (and how to trade both back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the Central Authority controls and processes individual communication.
In the case of Bitcoin, all the nodes of the depositors of the current accounts, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers are all.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
In this way, the network may verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of current accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is the writing of this new transaction into this book.
It will have the right to complete this additional line by solving the mathematical task given to computers whose resolution, some temporary central banker, will be entitled to complete this additional line.
This is the file cutting phase; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take this new transaction" and add a number to it, only then the whole deal "shut up".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (at the beginning of zero).
As soon as this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction will then be indestructiblely displayed on the chain of all other transactions; any modification would be made to the print.
If the user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned because each of them has a different print.
A computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by 21 million, but they can be divided into a hundred millionth of a year, so the space for the margin is...
The difficulty of the task is also increasing with increasing levels of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rise and fall.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the bitcoins have been stolen.
"The used loophole does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a company for payments with real money that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players such as Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizman Institute in Israel recently analysed a book of current accounts and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not overrun.
In November, "Brother discounts" were launched.
"Third thousand dollars have been replaced," he rejoices with Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to turn the bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogue book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (real money) or a non-connected pay phone, but uses Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the wearer manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up for traders, where no new terminals or software are needed.
Just communicate the address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, says Pierre Noizat, which ensures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and move towards more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin does, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB foresees re-evaluation of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and US units should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and that the Afghans choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside who we punished suffered the most harm because we considered them terrorists.
And so have we. After all, we've lost 88 dead soldiers, and what about all those injuries and maiming?
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often rurals who refuse the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though the jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They now experience tolerance and often help from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The exit of French units from the base of Nijrab, which I followed from the peaks of mountains planted with tonsils thanks to French loans, took place in order.
The convoys of truck and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without attacking an air helicopter.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
From their unstoppable procedure in 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed significantly.
The cable was empty at the time and the ground was in the blood and fire as a result of the fights between the various resistance groups.
Their taking over control of the country was then considered as a kind of exemption, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these rurals, which was completely controlled by Al-Ka'ida, but their situation has not improved until now.
Some Muslims, Afghan government, and the current Taliban agree in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
Major war dignitaries against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, took possession of state land that they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used massive US subcontracting for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were never in combat.
Based on what I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that won't be made up of thieves.
A number of young people want to leave as those who have managed to use American generosity will leave: the way out the capital is significant.
Young people are already tired of war and associated ideology.
During exile in Iran or Pakistan, they learned the modern world and were interested in its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25; there are currently 5 million people living in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
There are public schools in the cities, girls and boys.
These young people will need to be given work, and they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of certain representatives.
All, including armed opposition, like mobile phones; television and Turkish TV shows the modern world, watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities to be led be considered legitimate?
Some commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already restoring provincial militias that will be outside central power control.
Afghanistan, a country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation following the pattern of Western states, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so that the Prime Minister’s post, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, since the 1950s and early years, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has recovered, no dam is in operation, no essential irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and vegetables.
The priority is a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumor has it that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And that just made the Western states feel that they were here just to get hold of them.
Without energy for working iron ore or copper on the spot and without the means to transport raw materials through the mountains, no mineral mining can take place.
The Chinese have already left the copper mine Mes Aynak and have left the international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore a vast Buddhist area to preserve the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends on a large part of both imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of common forms of assistance: girls' and boys' lycea, French departments at universities, French institute, military, legal, health and agricultural cooperation, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "to get a heart and soul" to try to reconcile the assistance and military activities, in which the "citizenship-arms" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) served as a service, which was cancelled in 2012, but, thanks to the countless French non-governmental organisation, has achieved a number of successes in the area of common interest and agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, involving a number of local workers, helped to dampen the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the culable area.
What memory will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often located at an altitude of over 2 000 m.
The Embassy received dozens of written applications for minor agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Capisa.
In order for these farmers to be free from the rebellion led by foreign groups, they wish, according to their words, to achieve minor civil aid in their behalf, which would be properly controlled and affected directly.
Troubled Work at the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursi has gone into another poker game.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the publication of the constitution, which temporarily confers on it unlimited powers, it decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of everyone else's opinion, that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text at the latest.
Less than a week ago, the Head of State granted this assembly two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, which weakens the country's constitutional stability and leads to legal arguments.
This new initiative has further strengthened the dissolution of the country.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president remains in his "autocratic delirious", continues "to break his word" and "to trample the law".
However, its supporters ensure that this is a means of turning as quickly as possible with the constitutional and political crisis and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that forces the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text of the Egyptians to clarify the article after the article.
For the President, it is also a way to achieve national and democratic legitimacy once again, while the whole country is rejecting protests.
As he confirmed in an interview for American weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians would vote for it.
Especially because this quickly organised vote builds up the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "You will approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers" which should otherwise be terminated after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special air yesterday, 85 Members of the Constitutional Assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most liberals lacked voting.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was declared, they banged the door with the fact that they did not have the opportunity to make their views known.
Human rights defenders, civil society or religious minority members have imitated them.
In order to achieve the undermining capacity, 11 alternates were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators continued to believe that one of the few disputes took place that day around... an hour for prayer, when some committee members held the view that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject matter of general attention, Article 2, remains ultimately consistent with the version of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped that they would replace the term "principle" with the term "regulatory", which would allow for more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for the other parts of the Egyptian society.
"Princidity," the liberals who only see it as a speech problem are objecting.
According to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
In particular, they focus on Article 220, which entrusts Al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular on issues concerning the control of the conformity of laws with the law of the Sharia.
According to a Egyptian expert Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "persons called for expression are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
"Theocracy can be seen in this."
The fear of liberals is even more shattered by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there has been no specific religious consequence.
Egypt remains a framework civil state with this constitution.
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not ulams, but university workers, many of them studied in French schools," Alexis Bluet, who prepares work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that "there may be contradictions regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used therein belong to the religious dictionary.
There is in particular a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic Legal Science, Note red.].
And in the future, there may be a question of the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment."
Yesterday’s approved text is very criticised, in addition to religious sites, because of the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction against the former regime.
Other disputed place: the powers conferred on the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the military, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by the Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
In addition, civil proceedings will not be prohibited in military courts, as requested by the human rights associations.
These associations speak in connection with the text they think is directed against freedom, about their doubts.
The criminal act of blasphemy is maintained and insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, stressed Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the ban on torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak in a television speech last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The head of the state will manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, buds of the world and sea from saturated salt solution await Ukrainian tourists
The promised earth combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and the integrity of nature.
AaF identified five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
To bow to holy places
Visit the Jordan River, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God’s mercy will come upon all who enter this “ spa. ”
And Galilee - instead of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming down the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers will pass through the way of pain, or Jesus ’ way of the Cross (Latin Via Doloros).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where there was a judgment, walks through the streets of Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's grave on Golgota - the place of crucifixion, the stone of anointing, and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian pup of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made the cross for Jesus' crucifixion.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wall of lamentations, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, according to tradition, people with different confessions leave notes with wishes, which will then be filled out.
Take the way around the vertical
The destruction of Masada’s fortress remained from the secret hiding place from the enemy, which Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those dealing with mountaineering can get to it by their own forces.
The others will take a cable to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous Hermon ski resort, which is experiencing a huge inflow of tourists in the winter months.
Tourists take a shuttle bus from the foot of the hill to this ski paradise.
The total length of mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, the pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't all come to visit in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, definitely worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea found in the caves of Judaea, and then about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth a visit.
In his exhibition there are widely represented impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit Al Bash's Museum of Spa, which represents several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with mannequins of spa users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the unique private museum of Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There's no guides or souvenir shops.
The admission fee is free and gifts are strictly rejected.
Fifth Museum - Museum of the Holocaust, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter, and you will find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are shimmering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the lands in which they perish.
Ukraine is also listed.
Improve Your Health
The three main spa centers of Israel are located on the coast of the Mediterranean, the Red and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea, the temperature of water does not fall below 21 degrees Fahrenheit and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe all year round.
By the way, the Dead Sea is the most unusual sea in the world, located at the lowest land point in the planet - 417 m below sea level.
Azure water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps people on the surface and people who can't swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to treat yourself with salty water - saltwater, and with a medicinal mud that can cure health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, trachea, diabetes to cure the twitchy nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them, there was a famous sea road connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautifulandromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists truly love toils through narrow streets, named after signs of a zodiac.
They say if you stick to the walls in the alley "your" sign, happiness will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their picture taken.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontsky.
A carefully renovated theatre is used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, for a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the Russian population speak.
It is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily trade for shekels (now it is 1 dollar about 3.8 shekel).
Buses are mainly used for urban transport, but there is a speed tram in Jerusalem and there is the only metro line in Haifa in the country with six stations that connects the lower town with the upper.
It's basically an underground cableway.
Travelling all kinds of urban public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can reschedule 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, he stops working at markets, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts a working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get kosher meals: except for pork, seafood, scallops and meals, which contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional jewish hummus porridge, various kinds of sauces, marbles made of ground chick - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of fed cats, which gratuitously "tumulate according to their taste".
In the evening, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Leading cats love populated places, and with taste they let themselves into any goodness.
Car rental will cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost on average 30 shekels.
Numbers expressed
Israel visited over three million tourists from around the world in 2012.
Most of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to know the country and rest.
From January to October 2012, the promised land visited 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Big and mighty" announces it to Moscow: migrants save money on their tongue
While MPs and human rights defenders are still discussing the law on compulsory language tests, frauds have already appeared in the country that sell 'forgery' certificates
There are 13 million foreign workers arriving in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into force, under which every worker will be required to submit an examination of the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal sectors, lifestyles and retail sales.
However, FMS promises that the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors in time.
However, the tests will consist not only of language knowledge but also of Russian history and fundamentals of law.
The knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exemption applies only to nationals of countries where the Russian language is the official language.
This law is not subject to even the people who have successfully obtained the certification and obtained the academic diploma of the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test posts will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between nations, Moscow State University, State University in St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres are already open in Russia today.
Members of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Service) supported the test introduction initiative.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders managed to ask the press many times: what will this actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
Thus, above all - the representatives of migration services respond - this will make it possible to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "slaved work".
Many people are talking today about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the board of directors of FMS of Russia in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights should be initiated before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in emigrants without professions, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with the conviction of Sebelev - is condemned to clashes with unholy people who, under the pretext of help, will provide him with a "prove" to terrible, tight apartments in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, will suffer for months without food and documents and will work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their country, but upon arrival they will cheat them, seize them passports, do not pay the promised wages," confirms the head of the Tadžic management of working migration of the MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't!
The less that many citizens of the Central Asian Republic who intend to commit themselves to work in Russia acknowledge not only that they do not know the language of the country they want to get into, but they do not even have the experience of the work in question.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, as rather unhappiness: only very few Turkmenistans, Uzbekistans, Tajiks can afford to acquire at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need decent clothes, shoes, and equipment for school.
As children grow up in productive age, they have to go to work on the first opportunity.
Without language knowledge, it's hard to admit.
"You're feeling humiliated and underpriced."
It is true that, given the law on language tests, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out for migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't be taking tests or getting any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally as they used to live in Russia.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized Entry "
Many of the incoming workers claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
Reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But the fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police personnel know that we have basically fake documents, without registration, and that's what blackmail cases come out of it.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists about their experiences a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuschadamov.
"Come on, don't be mean, buy a painting."
On the first day of the Law on Language, false documents were found not only of migrants' registration.
The employees of the FMS have already confiscated several false certificates of passing the language test.
Forgery documents are printed on an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, they didn't get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants in the hope of making it easier for them to take tests, they paid 7 thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times the amount of the official test: it'll cost the migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the nearest future is to protect the system from corruption, so that workers cannot simply buy documents, including government officials and human rights defenders.
Meanwhile, the government may promise foreign workers who have failed the tests for the first time the time needed to take the course of Russian language foundations.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active dealing with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of Interior) does not bring an illegal arms market into circulation
The share of crimes involving the use of legally held weapons is very low
The MVD of Russia submits a proposal to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
It is the response of the government to recent events: the cause of the shooting at weddings that occurred without a victim, and the massacre prepared by Moscow's attorney Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the use of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can obtain a licence to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Committee's pride in security and the fight against the corruption of Irina Jarovaja, which promised that changes to the Arms Act will be presented to the State's pride in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem on the way to "strengthing screws".
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the refusal of "unsensual tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the BBC's Russian editor.
According to statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes were committed in the six months of 2012 using firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of Interior, while 1168 thousand crimes were committed in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of civil weapons legislation does not require the perpetrators to switch to the "black" market.
According to their words, any weapon can now be found in Moscow at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
"Black" arms market is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranec, who has worked for ten years at the departments of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages that receive orders of arms
The first one - "arm or army path", means a weapon that was stolen during the fights on the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the caucasians themselves," says the Baranec.
Another type of "black weapons" are stolen criminals with representatives of security forces.
The Lamb explains that this also includes theft of police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the employees of the authorities active in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" are being sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It is proven that some fires were set up intentionally - to cover the manka," says the former soldier.
They bring their contribution according to the words of the Barance and the manufacturers of weapons.
"There are currently private arms companies which are not competitive in the international market and which exclude weapons that supply to the black market, including Moscow," says this expert.
The next source of the black market is smuggling.
Particularly large numbers of guns and vending machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in painting, and the mafia that organized their continuous production was created," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have added up what is the approximate share of individual sources of illegal weapons supplies to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Analysis of Problems and Design of Public Administration.
Specialists have collected reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminal literature and data from public data portals focused on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, say researchers, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons have been found on the black market "the guilt of official agents whose work is linked to weapons," says the report.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons from armed conflicts came from, 14% of the cases were stolen in their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the arms stores that asked us not to mention his name is convinced that the weapons found in the black "archeology" excavations have long since been bought - are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, dealers go for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
In spite of the Ensign, he will buy a unit, such as a TT gun.
You order a gun with him and he sells it over your fence.
"He will take it to the city and sell it for 900 euros for a piece with two stacks," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and that's why whenever they start to burn a plan in the explanatory notes of crimes, they're going to make a check-up with illegal arms dealers," he adds.
Like in a fancy store.
The seller and the buyer most often find one another through their friends.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me the opportunity to go to the test platform where there will be a man who would lead me to the "bitch" where we will act together.
I learned the prize up there.
Military rapporteur Viktor Baranec
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, told by the seller - an advisor. - I have a friend, but I don't trust him.
The sellers are on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell him that the daughter fell out of the tooth."
And now I'm gonna get there through a man I'm sure of.
He'll also only deliver them to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Starters are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was processing a stand to publish on this subject.
The diagram has not changed according to his words.
They gave him a photo album where it was "everything you thought of".
"I felt like I was in a fancy store," remembers the soldier.
The buyer, according to the words of the Lamb, does not offer a rabbit in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, I'm just not buying - we're going to go to the woods with the seller, and we're going to build a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and if I can convince myself that the gun shoots well, we start to act," describes the expert's procedure.
Stock on the sofa
The search engine will guide you to web sites and groups on "Contact" where it is offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are needed for this.
"It's enough to have a set amount of money," they write in the advertising caption on the website "Buy a fighting gun or a vending machine".
On this site users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to a minor?
"Of course, without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the original is preserved).
"I'll buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the demand of "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently launched an enormous network of web sites and people who wish to buy a military weapon can plunder a shovel.
People are just about as hungry as bait, and then they're going to pick up coal in Siberia.
Military rapporteur and senior military dignitary Viktor Baranec
I have heard of such diagrams:web pages are usually registered beyond the limits of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make a payment through the ATM.
"In response to this, the seller will send him a photograph and a description with instructions where the gun is hidden," says the non-governmental press spokesperson, Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranec confirms that after entering an order on the website you can stay without a weapon and find yourself behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has recently launched an enormous network of web sites and people who wish to buy a military weapon can plunder a shovel.
"People play the hungry fish on the bait and then conquer the coal in Siberia," he confirms.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, you will normally pay from $100 to $900, according to experts' estimates.
According to Dmitry, you're going to get Makarov's gun for $100 to $300 from a non-governmental organization called "Right to Arms."
You have to wait a month and a half months.
The weapon is dispatched from warehouses to long-term storage through medium-art warehouses.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% compared to January - October 2011 and 22.9% of cases, and the number of reported cases of the theft and blackmail of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast food and supermarket workers strike
Working at the treasuries of McDonald plants will pass up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, a wave of low wage protests has risen in the Walmart hypermarkets and fast food chain restaurants, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn to wave nine or whether it will soon disappear.
The entire share is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries received by regular workers in Walmart and in fast food systems, the aim of the protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their trade union organisations.
At present, this economic sector is practically intact by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The event began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "black Friday", when the orgy of cheap sales hit America, engulfed millions of inhabitants and in some cases was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart employees, working around the world for 2.2 million people, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade chain multinational trade companies' trade unions and left-wing activists, whose goods are intended for lower and middle-class people.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many low-wage employees in Walmart stores buy only at their work.
The availability and range of goods have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply because only a few pay his employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or manual scanners.
The demons on "black Friday" demanded an increase in wages and complained that the health insurance costs provided by the company increased rapidly from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee receives $9.5 per hour, but that does not correspond to the amount of expenditure, says the staff.
Students from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 per hour, it'll cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company spends on wages now.
If Walmart transfers the wage increase fully to the consumer's shoulders, every business visit will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than today.
Walmart’s defenders point out that protest was only in nine countries and that it should not cause any damage to society.
"Black Friday" lasted from 8 a.m. on Thursday until midnight, and during this time Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, her cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on "black Friday".
Dan Fogelman said in an interview for the left-oriented Huffington Post website that the jobs left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all "other media sensations" organized by the trade unions.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York where their goal was not Walmart business houses (they are not very popular in this progressive town, and therefore they are almost there), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't pay you a sick one, and he doesn't pay you for your honest work!
Deban Williams, a member of New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage for work is paid in accordance with federal law and the New York State rules $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wage, but only slightly, and on average, their serial workers in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
In this expensive town, no one has a lower wage.
I don't understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
The McDonald employs almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the desk for part-time and live with their parents.
Few people see this as their main food source or plan to stay there for a long time.
At present, I constantly meet with McDonald workers who complain that they must live out of this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, at the Wall Street Journal forum, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
The protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonalda on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks in fast food companies start getting at least $15 an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also called for trade unions to be established in the field of fast refreshments.
American laws prohibit the management of trade union organisations and punish activists with bullying and release.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is also difficult for objective reasons to introduce a trade union in fast food companies.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Consent
On this day there were also loud protests in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The peak of the event was at the noon meeting at the "McDonalda" near Times Square, where there were several local democratic politicians, in particular a member of the City Council of Debrane Williams, who said: "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions and then doesn't pay you the sickness and pays you for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for the mayor of the city of Billa de Blasio, who said that "we must speak together to support fastfood workers in order to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity, as every New Yorker deserves!"
As described in the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American sphere of fast refreshment.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, although not all of them were employees of fast refreshments that employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
Whether this event will become a spark that will light the flame of the mass movement is yet unclear.
"So far, the brain manages to deceive on average."
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is a popular theme of widespread reality; recently it means seeing the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of summer, Google presented a working model of this news at its annual conference and in November it was announced that Microsoft also submitted a request for the relevant patent.
From an interview with the head of an interactive 3D technology group in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadim, it appears that glasses are already the past for the scientists of this company.
It is a perspective of handling virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public areas.
Please tell us what your research group is dealing with.
- We deal with the interaction of man with machines, but at the same time we try to move the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity is stuck in the stage of work with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look ahead to 5-10 years forward and anticipate major changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone there is a very interesting possibility of driving by gesture.
What else awaits us in the future?
- No matter how much interaction the Kinect system has passed on to the physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system accepts more data), but the output flow has not yet been particularly improved.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more suitable form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
That's a popular thing, but is it underestimated?
- Certainly he cannot be considered a panacea - a question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling equipment in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about fluffy ones, just about such slender, short ones.
The gesture would not be recorded by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movement of the bones and muscles.
It's big so far, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the bracelet watches.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
How, for example, do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what a machine can or cannot at a given moment?
- That's not necessary, but it's mutual convergence.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors that provide a relatively good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Is today not enough resolution, depth, or anything else?
That's what we can bounce off in our work on a three-dimensional recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 f/s.
But it's not just megapixels, it's like math and depth.
At the present time, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this gives work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So the speed, the number of shots per second is also very important.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows of 30 images per second are frankly a little little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while current serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much this affects human interaction with the machine.
For me at work would be a very useful equivalent of such equipment, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some extra images per second.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- Three cameras are now being used in Kinect's system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver of a reflected signal.
And already the third camera - it's actually a common sensor of the visible band.
It's not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or worsen it because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations made.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the camera location curve and see how it will help to determine the three-dimensional position.
- As I recall, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not publicly present his glasses.
Don't you think it's one of the most promising platforms in everyday use of extended reality technology with special glasses?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "transferable" form of the expansion of reality, when it would be possible to switch from the cloud platform to the smartphone at any time, the projection display and then around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in this is their strength (only you see private things), and at the same time a weakness - extended reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that handling virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands can't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that widespread reality - that's the seventh consecutive breakthrough in interaction between man and machine.
I think that supplementation of touch impressions could possibly be an eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - using the second hand as a certain kind of display base.
In an excellent way, it records compressions!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding palatability to these "images in the air" - for example, interference of several direction ultrasonic beams at the defined point where the finger is located, causes a touchy feeling, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on your belly of your fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve ending in your fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain yet?
To think he feels what he seems to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for for a long time - how to get a person who is physically located in a very tight space to believe that he is walking through an open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country tracks (even not in clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If brain deception becomes the goal, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so attractive for researchers - many things are in the very beginning.
Instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the "Petrohrada avant-garde" project dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront of culture and art.
At the top of the list, there were already important figures of the art scene of St Petersburg, whose gains go beyond the city's borders, often find recognition in Europe without reaching the universal fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who's all dressed in red, who you meet at the Russian museum, the summer garden, fashionable pubs and vernissages.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they're exposed, always attract crowds.
Cyril Miller is one of purely social and philosophical petrohrad storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is the prominent man of the petrohrad avant-garde end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
In addition to being a urban person, his appearance in the streets makes people smile, he makes everyone feel better.
Recently he took the bottle and became a petrohrad flasher because he matured into this difficult role with his whole divine life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you walking all over town in red and not in yellow or, for example, turquoise?
- I chose the red color as a designer with a look and a picture.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between artist, imagemaker and public.
Although it is generally true that anything that is just a little different from the grey one raises aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on having an interview.
The whole history of my provocative actions is, above all, an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my work was exposed.
I understand what my path is.
That's when a wave of old free, unofficial artists passed, and I couldn't understand the new, free types of artists.
I made friends with the artists of the new wave, with post-gasovsky who led us to "Pushkinské 10", and the other waves were not.
It tempts me to theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except the word.
- And all of this was combined in your art-clinical...- for me it was important to be in the center of Petérburk culture where all the best powers of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995 I occupied a place on Pushkinské 10, and there existed a music-art club, a Bohemian club, the home of the peterburk gods before the reconstruction.
There were many born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Snure brought with the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
Both the string and his friends sang light songs under the cape, dressed up in the adjoining turquoises, among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now fashionable.
When the band started playing live, she became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg led many programs of Hali-galivian times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, thus his great career, basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the club "Grivaledov" - that's the accent of Art Clinic.
This is where our working and regular guests left.
I'm the hero of the last century when culture meant something else.
In 2000, the survey was organized in the press, the special price was "People in our city".
In the Artist of the Year nomination, I was appointed to finish my peak.
In the new times according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In these years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are today different things, you can be popular but not too cultural.
- Your works are characterized in a identifiable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits, in which there is a live capture of the topicality and permeability.
I'm going to have a program show called the Russian Museum of Clowns.
Clowns are timeless categories.
I used to be sociable, today being so is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, it's all over the place. Tragic.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by means of totalitarian disguise in the order of order.
Today people meet according to their clothes, they focus on external mechanics, not on their inner person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
We've seen you recently as an urban flachnetist-- a cultural town should have such a hero.
And who's supposed to be that if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- Currently, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There's a breakdown of cultures.
Back in the day, people would meet in stupidity, and Gods would love one another, the simple of another.
Today, everything has broken into micro-community, today it's very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
It's time to think about who you're going to like today.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And a few thousand viewers will come to Stas Mikhaylov!
It's where the fans come in. It's where the social sphere is sexually involved.
And 300 people come to the cultural land and 10,000 don't come, and the result is less management, less money, and less money.
I have fans, the point is, no one's gonna fool them or break what's experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that were hanging from one collector on the wall together with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that people usually end up with.
People are often confused today.
They say: spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that's elsewhere.
I am a man of culture last day, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for drawing paintings.
And I'm for a culture like that.
Cyril, what's the shortage in Petérburk?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such an idea: an activist through a culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
It was not so for the good times of the tsars in everything, the tsars may not have understood the culture very much, but they understood the need to support the real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
In St Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they're stuck somewhere in the corner, because there's a need for great experts who will appreciate these experts and put them on the right track.
It's getting better today.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petérburk is?
- Petérburk - it is not the capital city of culture, in Moscow there is culture much more, there is the right land.
And in our eel, art is bad.
We need cultural land, but there are writers here today more than readers, that's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious about showings and concerts.
In our country, the layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashionable matter, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented by means of the grant of St. Petěrburk
Parents in Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
The caravans of space corabs with earthling on board are going on the road looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how do we keep your family in a state of troublelessness or a given alternate planet?
I don't think the choice is any big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adoptive, even if hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Srdin, a highly-educated scientist of the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Šternberga (SAIŠ).
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, the surface of Venus reaches temperatures of 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
Living there is only possible at a height or orbit of Venus... in the universe.
The question of reproduction in the universe has begun with flora.
Exams on plants were carried out half a century ago.
Four generations of games grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
It was then carried out with insects in orbit - the very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to verify how an embryo developed in a state of troublelessness.
We get an absolute normal bird on the exit.
But then there's trouble.
"A serious problem with this bird having to find resistance, must stand on its own and start moving," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they can't find a resistance, birds fall chaotically and make cobras.
After 10 hours, complete loss of instincts occurred in freshly hatched birds.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they just died in four days.
"We had birds hatched twice, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," comments the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Syčev.
The last "miniarch" of animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
On the biosate of "Bion" but only beings of one sex.
There has been an experiment with rats who have already been broadcast into space.
In fact, they didn't reveal anything supernatural there.
"It was only on the biosatelites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts need to be done," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the earth, a progeny was born with cosmic rats.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a tough task.
Animals, when losing their normal environment, simply cannot implement their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, can, in principle.
Homo sapiens rules abstract thinking and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The most dangerous threat was the Tsareshkovs.
The most precious thing humanity has is a female body.
Our Cheva flew away, and no one on Earth could say if she could last a flight to space.
Whether he can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"No one has answered that question yet," says Vachtang Vachtang, a veteran of the rocket-space sector.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight to space, she gave birth to the first woman named Valentina Téreškovová.
The father of the child was also the astronaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman, the cosmonaut, Savicky, was born, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in the open universe.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts born and healthy children after many years.
"It can be dangerous even during orbital years," says the astronaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia Valerij Poljakov.
Mankind, however, must inevitably seek new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydroboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in conditions of zero attraction, astronauts adopt the habits needed to work in an open universe.
The water mimics the state of troublelessness.
Although water is comfortable for adults, but in a strange way, for young children it is a natural element.
Small ichtianders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is on average 9 months in mother’s fruit water and that it is easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, it's logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only two weeks will pass.
"It's very little to let the baby forget something," says Marina Aksenova's Newborn swim instructor.
In short, if a newborn baby has a more natural condition, then for women there is a more natural irresistible gravity, an attractive force.
In troublelessness, the abdominal muscles, the pelvic muscles, and the body’s ability to expel the fetus occur very quickly.
We can put that aside if the muscle stimulators work at birth.
After all, it is possible for birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother’s organism will drain the fetus.
"And what else?" says Valerij Poljakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If Earth’s attraction is not affected by the organism, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or muscle system.
Newborn on orbit is not possible to dress as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he can train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs to develop.
"If we go with you into an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unadapted to the local environment," predicts the head of the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov Bioethics Commission.
So the dissolution of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
One day, however, there will be a time when reality will come and earthlings will go out in their cobras on a far away planet that will become the home of their descendants born in space.
Head of the SAO: The system control failed by politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation in connection with public procurement, but it moves in its application.
In an interview for News.cz, the Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct for its application - that's what I think is missing," comments Kalo's current situation.
Similar conclusions also suggest joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of bad practice, Peter Nečas’s approach to the so-called "swarcsystem".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS will not bother the entrepreneur with his controls - is it forbidden or permitted?
"The law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the office, which has the duty to control and enforce obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly was that about?
It's a parallel checkup that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, the issue is that European legislation regulates how to deal with public contracts, followed by individual national legislation, and then by practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the check is not yet finished, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, legislation may also be "sterner and more perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to address the application of the law itself.
In fact, what can this project help you, what does it do for you?
Such joint control could help to stop making efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits when this does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price to exclude enrichment and possibly criminal action.
But by reducing the limit of contracts, we don't necessarily have to achieve that.
Maybe the system is going to be so full of "paper" that those in the system who want to look for holes will be able to draw a lot easier on it than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of legislation concerning public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it otherwise set?
As for the authorities, like the SAO there works the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, it just forms a little different, but in principle both authorities act similarly.
The powers are also to some extent similar, but the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, that the Courts of Auditors also have at the level of individual federal countries - in that the system differs a bit from ours.
The BRH can only control federal money, represented by state resources.
Public funds managed by regions and municipalities are controlled there from the level of the federal accounting courts.
What about the legislation there, so it's easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is referred to as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that it is better in everything.
Is it also because they have better controllers?
No, I'm not, but I'm saying again, I don't like this kind of comparison.
But it must be said that even the countries that we consider to be a model facet with a whole range of problems.
Otherwise, there would be no benefit for them to cooperate with our office, would there?
With regard to the domestic legislation, what was the amendment to the Public Procurement Act for your office?
Since the duration of this amendment is quite short, it is not yet in our control actions.
Because we're doing ex-post checks, we need to count on a certain delay.
So far, we are only observing this in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool "to detect the risks of economic inconsistencies", through which we have made nearly 14 thousand public contracts, and we have analysed them - there of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because limits will change, conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted and so on.
So, do you consider the approval of this law to be a benefit or a further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it is confirmed.
The problem that might arise here is that the rules will "tighten up" and cannot be followed.
Already in the operation of previous rules, controlled persons are bound by the provider (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to mean that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is the law worth tightening up?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to invade and abuse it, not punish those who commit formal doubt that has no impact on decision making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where we don't go.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS will not bother the entrepreneur with the control of the so-called "swarcsystem" - and what does that mean?
Is the Svarc system forbidden or permitted?
The law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits something, then neither the Prime Minister can prevent the office, which is responsible for carrying out control and enforcement duties.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and let it go," but he can't say we're going to do it like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act there are rather strict rules on how to formally implement - which is right to protect public procurement.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the best bidder is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct for his application - that's what I think is missing.
The roads are frozen, mostly but sliding
In several places of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
Most of the time, it's downhill, somewhere with more caution.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary Region this morning, the roads were mountainous, but sometimes frozen and also snowy.
Temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but during the day it is expected to warm slightly.
The snow in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
There is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Krušné Mountains.
The sites were also lower visibility due to fog, resulting from data about regional roaders.
R6 expressways and first-class communication are now non-restricted in the region.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frosty and slimming.
All the roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads, are also mobile.
However, in some sections there are still residues of frozen and places of runaway snow.
Particular attention should be paid to driving in higher positions.
Pardubický and Královéhradecký kraj
On some roads in the eastern Bohemia there is a risk of frosting, in higher positions and in the mountains there may be a strait layer of snow on the roads, informing on its website the Directorate of roads and motorways.
Road drivers can warn drivers of the frost, especially in the higher positions of the Pardub region.
The trail can be located in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Police, Svitav or the High Myth, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically, roads I/43 and I/34 are treated in Svitav.
Snow is mainly on the roads in Giant Mountains and Orlické Mountains.
The captured snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemia, it is most often clear to half clear today without precipitation.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Fahrenheit, blowing low winds.
Plzeň Region
The roads in the Pilsen Region are down this morning, but there is a need to adapt the weather with increased care and care.
It's freezing in the morning, the temperatures move between three and nine degrees below the freezing point.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some of the communication may be frozen.
Places must count on the driver with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
It's coming from information about regional road users.
The D5 motorway is almost without limit, but increased caution is recommended by the communication administrators between 80 and 131 km.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plzeňsko and Tachov, however, we may have frozen sections.
Communication of the second and third classes is wet, and in this case the alerts of the frozen sections are valid.
Drivers should be careful on less frequented routes in the area of Šumava.
Olomouc Region
With snow mash on the road today, drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region must count.
After the chemical spray, she remained on the Red Mountain saddle and on her way in the direction of the Videl cross.
The motorists have driven snow on the night of the snow, about three centimetres snowed in Šumpersko according to the road managers.
In the other parts of the region, roadways are mostly non-restricted.
"Sumperland lies in the highest remains of snow.
With snow mash on the Red Mountain saddle, drivers must count in the direction of Jeseník," said the CTK of the Šumperk Road Administration.
In the field at night, their colleagues went to Jesenicka, the roads to and the highest positions are now, according to them, after chemical treatment, bare and wet.
There are no restrictions on Olomouc, but drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the roads remained wet.
Ústecký kraj, Liberecky kraj
Just a few hard-to-swimming places are reporting to the roadman in the north of Bohemia this morning.
In addition to several places with snow invaded or iceberg, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústeck is also closed, resulting from a police database.
Temperatures are kept below zero in lower positions, so ice and snow are likely to last on roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
Operating complications have not been reported yet.
The occurrence of the refrigerator is reported by roaders mainly from the surroundings of Štětí.
The meteorologists said that the weather conditions were ideal for her at night - during the day of rain and melting snow, at night bright and cold.
Main moves are reported adverse conditions on I/13 road on the border of Ústecké and Liberecky region.
The closure from Telnica to Knínice forced the bent branches of the trees, which were bent to the road under the load of snow.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think is about the end of the world for less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we people like to catch.
Together with The tap tap, we make fun of it and we say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a national fundraiser that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
The day before December 20th, from 21 p.m., 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will be held simultaneously.
They will end at about a time when a Mayan calendar will end on Kiribati Island in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
It was probably my idea, then we made it all up together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to gathering enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which we will give this world to our children one day.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap tap band, along with other artists, also sang an anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Disrupted".
She's very popular today on YouTube, so does she sound at these benefit shows too?
Of course, in a complete conclusion, that is, if we succeed and the end of the world does not happen...
It is sung by all the performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
Anthems will now be connected in a unique direct transmission to Czech Television.
The words for this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the video by Tomáš Hanák, who also sings Xindl X...
How did you get into cooperation with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we are holding a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are trying hard to involve them in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What's the benefit from the concerts against the end of the world?
For equipment of the barrier-free studyo educational centre, which we have implemented for the sixth year with the civil association tap in Jedličkov Institute.
For students of the Jedličko Institute, teachers regularly attend and devote themselves to activities they are enjoying and interested in.
Students alone do not have the means to go for teachers themselves, so we are trying to allow them to do so in this way.
As part of the construction of the Jedličko Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
There are several musical groups and performers performing at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We've been trying to build a program that will address all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere will perform with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning some kind of "bombastic event" for the future?
In May we will be performing for the first time in Prague Spring, so we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, while we are in the USA, would like to link this to the performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimal, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The tap tap is, however, a group made up of hendicated people.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on the electric cart, her carts must travel in the luggage compartment, then, of course, we bring with us a large amount of cargo and crates with tools...
However, so far it has always been done without any problems, the ČSA and British Airways have been perfectly prepared for us to wonder how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we came back recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how the individual differences in barrier, public access to the hendricked ones and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than ours, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything in the east is still in full beginnings.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric wheelchair to move himself in the city center.
There's no such thing as a wheelchair instead of an elevator.
Fortunately, even there are civil associations that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, do we still have to catch up to a more advanced country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
It is common in London and Madrid that people with heavy hendicap move independently in the public, can go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever...
It is not very common, however, that a large number of people with disabilities would actively participate in social life, in that on the contrary, we are a little ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or for the indiscriminateness is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will things start to change truly.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have strong will.
The tap band is very popular at the moment, but let's go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I joined the Jedlicka Institute, where I had many young people around me who were interested in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing saxophone among other things, I've started a music ring with my colleague.
Well, over time, what our host, Láďa Angelovich, calls it, got a little out of hand (Laughter).
But the popularity hasn't come in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with famous singers and also actively work on promoting the band.
It occurred to us that a job that can't be seen is basically as if it didn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to make it this high with The tap tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is filled with things where one imitates the other.
It's logical, everything new is taken carefully, and it takes a long time.
Things that are rare are very little, but I dare say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it's natural...
But the regret is absolutely unnecessary, because people with hendipus are not suffering all the abandoned beings we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop themselves, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if anything happens to people with hendikep, it's not just for them, it's for the whole company.
Did this success also help by being a strict boss, as many people have identified you?
When we want to do good work, we need to be uncompromising in many things and demand a certain discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with romantic imagination and head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, go to the product and spend a lot of time travelling to concerts, they get excited to leave them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
The tap tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave and come, it's impossible to stop.
Who has the will and the taste, always has the door open with us
The day before the expected end of the world will take place on Thursday, 20.12.2012 from 21:00
In Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fleda and Ostrava Plynojem will be held with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will be connected by telemost at the end of the evening in the band's song The tap tap "The End of the World Cancel"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free education centre STUDEO at the Jedlicko Institute in Prague of CZK 25 million.
Entrance to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old have free admission tickets in the presale Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as a 20th member of this European Space Agency as a second country from the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and took part in a number of Agency projects over the following years.
However, Poland's path to space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts devoted themselves to space flights before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I will remind you of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on 6 December 1933 represented ideas from his pioneering work Entering space.
The ideas of a young engineer (born 1905) left listeners cold and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Award for the Entry of Space in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned space promoter and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon was named by his name.
As early as 1925, a railway crew was built in Poland, which was supposed to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and neither are the details of the project known.
It is neither clear whether the rocket was to be used for the launch of the drone or for its application.
Information about this division is known only from time print.
Since 1933, rocket missiles began to deal with Polish artillery.
The research provided the Cell of Arms Technology in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckieg.
From preserved materials it is clear that research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, research was interrupted by the coming of the German troops.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter rocket appeared in the professional press, designed by an engineer of Rohoziński, and in the following year the work of Rakiet - an air torpedo and a rocketomb of the airman of Levyw-Krzywobłocký came out.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Temporary Advisory and Science Committee) coordinated all the projects of military use of rocket technology.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity its activity ended the start of the war.
After the war in Polish press, other works dedicated to cosmonautics appear thanks to the work of the Polish astronaut Society.
For the first time, there is a mention of society in the November edition of the 1954 magazine Problems, in which there are four more comprehensive articles devoted to astronauts.
In one of them, since Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
By then, projects of artificial satellites had already started and it was clear that space research was a prospective field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronaut Society (PTA) has been trying to enter the International astronaut Federation (founded 1951) and in autumn PTA has become a proper member.
And in the following year, PTA President Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International astronaut Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been involved in the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Measure rocket) that has become the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start took place on 10 October 1958.
The 1800-meter rocket was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later an improved version of RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959 the flight tests of two-stage RM-2 rockets were launched in the Bledov desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type should already have been capable of real scientific work - RM-34 rocket should have reached 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the height wind.
However, in 1962, further developments were suspended.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965 became the successor to the first RM.
The rocket was designed as two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (labelled Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed that differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 litres.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting mass of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is still necessary to mention Poland's entry to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland was also involved in space research on Soviet artificial satellites under the Interkosmos programme and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remkov.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the Public Labour Act.
The resolution gave rise to a live discussion in the public.
Of course, it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, stand in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and free trade, nothing unlimited movement of private capital, along with unconditional financial speculation.
Influenced by significant differences in labour price, (med) there is a price tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer tries to compete with cheap goods by "depressing" the competitive price in order to pull out a larger market share and thus increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means either translating production into abroad or buying it cheaply or disappearing.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment generated, the social expenditure of the State is necessarily increasing.
The whole situation makes it impossible for business masters to pay their taxes and thus replace the economic and social damage they have caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so generally known that no specific statistical data need to be provided.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create situations in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to all the population, regardless of the social decline.
This is manifested mainly in the changes to the applicable laws.
The objective is to economically force its own population to adopt a price dictatorship of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This is also the case with a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, as well as by reducing workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For many years there have been public food supplies for poor people who cannot benefit from their own work in the SRNA.
The number of these people is already going into millions.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is common for well-employed people to receive such wages that they must be paid to existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary members of the Federal Chamber.
The savings of virtually all Southern EU countries clearly lead to the same situation when people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in the social level are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century, or to live for hungry wages at the edge of society in the hope that one day private investment will come to the country.
But where does it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or Africans are still working for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim to be unable to participate capitally on their own economy that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital insists on the opinion that the State must not interfere with the economy by means of management interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, now it actually controls politics and the state in its own selfish sense.
Here's a clear answer, yes.
The evidence is the existence of virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation occurring in the area of corruption, providing mutual advantages, legislation, where practically everything is punishable, but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the State’s Ministry of Finance for lack of funds provides for the drafting of draft laws to private law firms that are inexorable in connection with industry.
These laws are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from people as Western Constitutions declare it, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly entering into the situation as described by the Appianos in his work of the Roman Republic crisis in Caesar and Pompeia: "The state has long been in complete decomposition and the authorities have been bolstered with violence.
For bribery, illegal gain of favor and by means of stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption were in no way taken up, and the people went to elections with a pre-sold voice," "characterial people did not apply for office at all, so once he was able to stand without consuls for eight months as a result of this dissolution." "It really started to talk about the fact that the only cure in a bad situation is self-government and that there was a need to choose an energy man."
The conclusion, as in the Ancients, is the present company based on the reckless preference of its own advantage irrespective of the social interest.
Private capital is no longer, by its very nature, able to understand and apply the benefit of society as a whole.
The result is now, as at the time, the unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort to reform deeper.
The causation of the origin of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current situation, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of the next round.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that current elites are completely ignoring in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are now witnessing with crimes against humanity, as we know from both old and new history.
The abolition of the Act on Public Works is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure of competition at both international and European level, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the population's social level.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted policy-social reforms, which will strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the impact of citizens on the government and weaken the monopolies position of private capital in the company in favour of the State.
Israel: chaos lab.
"There's nothing coming from violence, and nothing can ever happen." Sting in a song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, there have been a lot of reactions.
One is behind Israel, they argue with its right to self-defense, and Palestinians fit as terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide of Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fits into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is in the periodically recurring waves of killing by the culprit and who, after all, victims, today's people of Israel, including self-righteous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
The point is to offer the readers a look behind the curtain, to look at who has been in particular for 95 years of lasting tension (counting from Balfour's declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by available historical facts some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or who group of people is the main driver of events of modern history.
The history of mankind is, first and foremost, the history of the power struggle.
In every epoch, we can track down some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities that were completely autonomous of their actions and whether or not someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We have to admit that we live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and its resulting powers could not have occurred in the lives of one generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families there is one who might consider itself the head of the octopus (if anyone is still standing above them, but I do not exclude it) - Rothschields.
It doesn't say much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) had already bought in the 1990s to stop combining its name with highly criminal acts in which they were standing and which always meant for them the consolidation of power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the central bank are not led or are preparing wars (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after attacking Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to deny this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the central bank of Rothschield's Bank of America, began spending his own (intelligible government) money during the Civil War and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK started spending his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, was murdered 1963, and Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for launching the major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led between 1859 and 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by the tower of the highest, 33rd degree of dedication by Albert Pike.
The first war was intended to remove large monarchy state units in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule in particular Great Britain, and the third was to lead to a reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury are enough and do not consume so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (Ecumenism is nothing but a premier for such solutions) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families headed by Rothschieldy is working is to create a crisis and then offer solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the founding of the FED in order not to repeat the crisis as the one that they caused in 1907).
So, after they succeeded in murdering the Habsburg successor to the R-U throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to start World War I, they destroyed the Russians by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (which was no longer needed for the destruction of Czar Russia) and then there was a fragmentation of Central European powers, Austria Uhersk.
For the easier start of World War II, political bankers had let the political bankers create a lateral conflict situation by introducing a massive war-reparation on Germany, creating the basis for radicalisation of the poor masses, and then it was enough to substantiate the Germans with a strong enough strong, culprits of identifying and simple solutions offering the Leader and the creation of a multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also to play, the function of the fifth column, with the ignition of the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschields encouraged the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as the capital city (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration has already created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population have begun.
Terror attacks occurred on both sides.
A second world war broke out, whether Hitler had broken out of the chain that was initially held by international bankers, or all he did was, it was difficult to estimate, in any case, that the suffering of European Jews in the concentrates created a prerequisite for accepting the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, like German War Reparations, the Second World War, a third outbreak was created by the Israel declaration.
If international bankers manage to start it, the Jewish nation, like in the other, will be the victims in the first line of battle, now together with the Arab or general Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country but also internationally (let's just take how hard people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in Palestine - Israel’s conflict, where wrongs produce injustice in the endless chain of violence, when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power at the beginning of all things?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, as with us, international bankers are pushing people to choose their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of the fascist, to international bankers loyal, a policy that does everything to start a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to rise into global conflict and, given the control of Iran over the Hormuz Strait, which travels 20% of all world oil (the sailing corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light is the words David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serve the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
"And forcing all small and large, rich and poor, both free and slaves to have on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that they cannot buy or sell, who is not marked by that beast or by the numeral of her name.
It's important to understand: who has the sense to add up the numbers of the beast.
That number refers to a human being, and it's a number six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 he occupied a crowd of demonstrating Islamic students of the American Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the hurled shah of Mohammed Rézu Páhlí, who fled to the United States after the revolution, who had been patronizing his regime for several decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer a positive starting point - it could not afford to throw a shawl over the deck, as it would substantially jeopardise trust with allies in other countries.
However, release of hostages in Iran, where revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the fiasco of trying to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after the negotiations were facilitated by the Algerian government.
Their purpose at home has led to a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debate in Iran has contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the history that America has won.
Six employees fled from the embassy just before they took over.
After difficult peripetions, they ended up in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went to Canada's passports as members of the film crew, which was watching the country's location for the shooting of sci-fi big film.
A combination of genres
The plan, which was developed by Tony Mendez's "exfiltrate" expert, required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to make the legend credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, held a press conference, a fictional production company had a real office.
The detail of the operation has been classified for a long time, the film comes from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of more genres.
On the one hand, a realistically understood political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", a story of a successful piece, a hoax - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
In the film, the moods are changed - on the one hand, the documentary sequence from Tehran (the subtitle sequence shows the iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situation was presented in the film - there are no big differences in that).
On the other hand, the lightened passage from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and a mild exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions, the men in the suits take the situation down at the table, in the halls of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck had a remarkable career restarter.
From a mocked actor he became a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after dark crime Gone Baby Goone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Affleck film that doesn't take place in the director's house Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the director's older films raised above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is also showing him in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in reconstructing real events - the initial sequence of the embassy fall is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time mediates the emotions of confusion and unforeseeableness that occur when history is moved somewhere clearly.
Affleck and his co-workers have a similar effect in the scenes of the fictional (false staff on the Teheran bazaar).
Too many things in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not offer very much in the film sense of exciting scenes.
He's been working pretty hard on it, sometimes he's thinking something about reality - things don't go so elegantly there (the scene in which the threat of a crisis at the Teheran airport turns the phone call in America and the chase after the ranch seems pretty far out of its hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the irritability resulting from the need to show too many stories in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood co-workers, but their characters would deserve more space and they are far from the only ones in the movie.
Affleck's film is kind of losing the dramatic move, it is a film that can be watched with a mild interest, appreciate the implementation of even the retro style evocating thrillers of the 70s.
It's just going to be hard.
As a reminder of a certain way of living history and an evidence of how excessive the ideas of almighty and all-knowing secret services are are, it is sufficient.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoky.com, which launches the poll every year for the most abstract bank fee, has now decided to declare a competition for 'the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop'.
"We have been led by the last event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the leadership of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher.
For example, among nominated absurdities, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance rates for men and women is already being taken.
So far, women have been favoured at life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place by the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
The EU's controversial regulation also includes mandatory mixing of bio-assembly into fuel, which is due to damage to nature, further banning the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of chicken cages, which has greatly healed eggs this year.
The criteria previously faced a real ban on the use of the term anointed butter or the elimination of classical light bulbs from the sale.
Quality bananas have 14 centimeters
The EU’s apparatus often decides under pressure of one or the commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend a state or group of states (the Czech Republic is now also a threat to the veto’s requirements).
The interest of the lobby was also due to the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach at least 14 cm in the Union and were not allowed to show "anomaal curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission was prevented by harmonising the existing unanimity national standards that complicated trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already softened despite the opposition of some states, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
The winner of the poll may also be the EU's last year's regulation, under which it must be mandatory to alert children under 8 years of age to sell inflatable balloons that they must not be inflated without the supervision of adults.
The EU has referred to US research, according to which balloons among toys are the leading cause of the death of children to suffocation.
Similar restrictions now apply to children up to 14 years of age when blowing into pilgrimage factions.
Curious ideas are born at home
It is also relatively absurd for European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) in view of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece.
In cooperation with the Laissez Fair's liberal economists, the BankingPayment Server nominated EU regulations on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities.
The EU has set maximum levels of food supplies that may have been located in the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded e.g. fixed volumes in preserved mushrooms, for which it was threatened by a high fine.
The organizers were also interested in the idea of paying certain countries for not having the sea and the idea of granting subsidies on request for subsidies.
However, these ideas were not created in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're handicapped by the fact that we don't have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said the Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he said that a lot of grain was born in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, he would have become full warehouses that he had to export.
The EU, according to Palase, was to pay hundreds of millions of euros to keep going to ports in the Czech Republic.
Finally, the European Commission came out to the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that have no access to the sea.
The grant grant was offered by the local Ministry for Local Development, controlled by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically to go to the writing of an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are the exception of:
While the regulation is an easy way for Member States to become the target of criticism, EU regulatory efforts and, at the same time, more effective functioning and development throughout the Union, they deserve more recognition, according to a number of experts.
An important problem, according to experts, is, for example, drawing EU subsidies on projects that have no indication of deepening European integration, but which Member States have forced in their budget negotiations.
The emotions among Czechs also mean that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products in Brussels, and will not always succeed in this fight.
The Czechs, after six years of fighting the Germans and the Austrians, have protected the names of the Olomouc shapes, but the domestic rum, its tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed the native producers.
Nameing rum can only carry products made from cane distillation, not from sugar beet.
The official list of EU registered products contains, for example, the Karlovy Vary Dryers, the fireflies and the Strawberry Carp as well as the Žatky Hops in the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marcipan from German Lübeck or Parm ham.
The EU’s protection mark can then also be prided on Pardubic meads and mustard pipes.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how do you think he wants to run for president?
I don't mean to be a senator or a president.
If this works in our country without any problems, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can no longer see the country breaking down, as thieves run around, people increase their taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to how to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent stranger, I have no choice but to influence things but to run for Senator or President.
You made it to the Senate, but then you went to Castle.
Won't you turn your back on the people who elected you?
All the time, I've been saying that I'm going to go to the Castle fight, according to the outcome in the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected Senator, I would run for president.
My goal, however, is not function, a function is how I can make my vision happen.
That's why I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
But the problem is, not only that we are broadcasting as a nation in pubs and television, but that we will trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
In addition, the media that dehones people and confuses the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie will be added.
For example, I was claimed to be paying a journalist or an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You have gone into the fight for the Castle with material and criminal responsibility of politicians and re-instated property confessions over 20 million.
To do that, you have to change the law.
As president, you have no authority but the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How are you gonna figure this out?
When I was lobbying as a citizen for the guidedom to be free trade, it was possible to do so.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or right, they reject on purpose, and that delayes citizens.
As an independent party, I have much more potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My priority is that without a party boxing and dogma I can take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing person or a left-wing person?
From the Czech perspective, it seems to me that people are more of a left man.
It doesn't matter to me at all if it's a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to go forward.
I don't care if anyone's on the left or the right, but I want people connected.
I will always support any good solution publicly, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or ODS, and I will still be against the wrong idea.
You're joking when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in the company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
Someone may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or are spoken of by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you're left with nothing but passwords.
And you're not gonna be able to do that in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you visit people and talk to them that you will manage to exercise, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists, and the public and try to get them to their side to do so.
If I were elected president, there is no problem in holding a live television broadcast, where I will ask the President of the parliamentary parties to enforce substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell me why they don't want her.
If there's a strong personality that's going to name bugs, it's possible to press on the political scene.
Take the President's direct election, that's what the public pressure did.
To be honest, I'm an amateur that I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
I have only just started in politics, and I will try to get the majority support for my programme.
I'm trying to move things myself if it doesn't work out, I'm gonna quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I won't do anything in one person, so I've been going around a number of people I know who'd also run to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, and he refused a lot of work.
So, at least, I supported Investigative journalist Jana Lorenc, who was tearing up soft-heated oil fraud.
I've been running for people who are really dissatisfaction, but now I'm in the dragons.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote, and those who went were elected mostly by the representatives of the establishment.
We're only two independents in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate to make changes difficult to enforce.
Yet, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or captains.
Are you thinking about setting up a party of your own?
I haven't considered it yet, because I don't have time to check every potential party's clean past, and I don't even have the money.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign. There's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
Don't you have the money?
Are you talking about property confessions, what's yours?
I'm guessing private property is about 60 million.
In Prague, I have land for about 25 million, apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, collection of works for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, Aston Martin has because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, he was gallant to women, while fighting against badness and wrongness.
You drive an Aston Martin, you own 60 million dollars and you don't have the campaign money?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put much money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million to campaign.
Am I supposed to owe myself?
I've hit the campaign for 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors is that I don't think he's interested in my program.
And I don't have an obligation to campaign to pay off my own.
The campaign costs will essentially cover what I'm going to receive from the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live out of it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If only I wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you're just gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd dampen these activities?
But it doesn't have to do with the raise.
As promised, I partially suppressed my activities.
For example, my representative will become a travel agent in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much were you used to taking a month as a businessman?
Two hundred to 400 grand, which I take further.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You can find the whole interview in the Saturday issue of Rights.
The architects of the MVRDV are proof that the real adventures do not take place only in the head - for example Spiskenisse and the recently built Mountain books - 2 pictures
"The building seems happy to me, looks futuristic. Finally, there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who's walking around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, means, "Of course, the house is nice."
But I ask what we need a library for today.
They all have Internet, iPad and electronic books.
None of these old-style libraries are going voluntarily today, are they?
Spikenisse, a locality close to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which is not worth visiting, holds a special record.
This community, with 80,000 inhabitants, has the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago, the decision came to contribute to general education and to build up seven nicely painted reinforced reinforced reinforced reinforced concrete bridges of fictitious bridges, which are shown on Eurobanks.
However, the success of the educational offensive was not reversible.
And so the city councilmen learned that there is only one way to become the masters of statistics: we must have a library!
The wine Maas from the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, the master of insanely bold column graphs and the developer of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the thing with the usual tranquility and appeared at the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the commission was still looking very hard at each other and shoving its shoulders, the bold Maas threw his gifts at himself by size and ended his actively justified speech with the words "Dear Town!"
So this is my proposal to the Mount of Books in Spiekenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain for EUR 30 million was completed.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town grey, which has not yet been able to offer more than a modern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, whose white facade you would rather expect milk, is therefore richer by a bit of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spikenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
Long Way to the Book
First impression: reading eldora under a cheese hatch.
In the middle of the massif of the mountain, while driving an elevator, you can only discover real spatial and reading passions when you walk through the topography.
On all sides, the glass interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burnt cab and the elegant street archery clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And books everywhere, books, books.
"Normally stands sheaths with books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down, and the space for the reader we pushed out of the inside.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is skilfully used: in the center there are offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and home technology.
A special pleasure is the black shelf for books, which are one wall cover, one parapet, and another the railing of the stairs.
See, the structure and smell are a foreigner.
Even the architects and build engineers have sworn on the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the city village Spiekenisse, on the question of Standard magazine.
And so, one day, we came across an appropriate agricultural waste product in one of the French farms.
For many years, in greenhouses and in fields in the Netherlands, it has been used as a base under the roots of millimetres of synthetic material.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
A thin textile lasts one, two seasons, and then matures to dump it into the bulky waste.
For the library, the route was - for the first time in such a quantity - pressed on the boards with a thickness of four centimetres.
The effect of heat and pressure is the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) in dark, homogeneous and loadable material, which smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
On 105 stairs you can get to the top.
In the end, you will be rewarded in a literary cafe with a fantastic view of the city, as well as Dutch croquets and figs in flower pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but especially the proper humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for the New Soul
"You may not believe it, but this house is, despite many glass surfaces, a demonstration project in terms of ecology," Trouborst says.
It heats and cools with the heat of the earth.
Although Mountain books are standing under a glass hatch, the sun only shines inside for a short time, even on sunny days.
The wide, glued wooden ligaments, which stand at the same time as the glass facade, serve as a cover and capture of a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be handled by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls Boekenberg "the long-awaited soul" Spiekenisse.
Reason: Every resident of the city was invited to open up a few weeks ago to give one book from his personal fund.
In this way, optical gaps were to be filled in in a library that currently has 70,000 pieces.
The concept has proven itself.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every citizen now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This succeeded MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called the formation of identity in the expert jargon.
Spikenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he may be.
That's the starting point for identity.
Shabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the decision to adopt Palestine.
According to a U.S.-European relations expert Stephen Szabo, Berlin balances on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany indicated first that it would vote against the proposal for a Palestinian observer status in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
But now Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's going to support an American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical to Israel.
Germany also abstained during the insurgent in Libya in March 2011 when it was the establishment of a no-fly zone.
That's finally NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear view of serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, in the direction of the policy, which was so-called the US, towards German foreign policy.
This is more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just settled in, but they're on their way to a more normal foreign policy.
The foreign policy they have in France or in the United Kingdom.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows its readiness to take national interests as well as positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect position in the Middle East conflict and vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has a large rectum in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to frighten the public but even the elite in Arab countries.
Anyway, that plays a part.
But I don't want to add too much importance to it, it's not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany harm its relationship with the US when Germany abstained from voting for both important decisions, for example when voting on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the USA there is a great understanding of German attitudes.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a break as it was on Libya's question.
Perhaps Germany will even bring some respect out of this.
This indicates that it must be considered an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, made it clear for the veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal policy.
I think Obama's government probably has a significant understanding of Europe's position.
But, as a result of the political situation there, of course, this position cannot be made public.
I don't think the differences in opinions are really as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not too excited about Netanyahu's politics at all.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the EU's most important partners on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germany if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently happening.
Therefore, they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead move things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future and will push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
It was always a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does he even want to take the lead?
Or is the lead role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, whenever Germany takes a bigger role, anti-German moods arise.
That doesn't make it any easier for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable for all sorts of neighbors and opinions, and it's not easy.
The impact of the US on European policy is now constantly falling, but the EU is currently failing to meet this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and make it much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What's Armani Polo?
This is followed by a mark which is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it uses protection until it is sued by the actual owners of the brand.
And even then it's not clear if they can do their job.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brand in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in breaking protection rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new case arrives on my writing table.
A few extra letters for counterfeiters to sign up for their brands.
For example, Gucci will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada they will have Prada-Kny registered.
In this way also German companies are legally copied, for example the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens the lister with a record of the stamp office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark of Zegna DF Puma protected. An artificial name that parasites even the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
In big cities, there are several storehouses where counterfeits are sold almost exclusively.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different. By his mandate to the mandants, he proceeds against having Chinese companies officially received from the stamp office the right to use a mark that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it Bang Mingpai, an affiliated brand.
This word focuses on Bang Dakuan.
That means women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It damages business, we have to wipe it," he calls for Pattloch.
"The screen will dissolution, the exclusive position will disappear, the image damage is enormous."
Financial losses and the costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially for expensive demonstration products.
According to the data of the company for market research CLSA, China is the third largest market in luxury goods and markets growing as fast as possible.
However, the deletion of questionable records in the brand register can be difficult to achieve and it costs something.
Control can go up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court rejected the action because the name of the case became a "market reality" after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff has bad luck, he must still pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's a jungle law.
Known cases also refer to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of the Sana construction machinery, a company which recently took over the German pump manufacturer for the Putzmeister concrete blend.
Therefore, the Chinese continue to be able to use an embryo that is similar to a Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue-brown logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was adjusted, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the known crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few employees and space.
But last year, he said, "the process of running the job was back to normal from the emergency situation".
For example, the number of pending proceedings on objections decreased by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Yet, 81,500 complaints still await the office to be dealt with.
Something against doing is expensive
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, more than 1.4 million brand protection applications were delivered to the CTMO, which is almost a third over 2010.
That's a record, and that means that the ten - year - old China is leading a list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of valid trademarks - a total of 5.5 million of them.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were collected in charges.
This simply means that each login is on average 1280 Yuan, or EUR 160.
The start of this dispute is multiple times as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
This group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
The Germans, though, have achieved an end to its illegal production of imitation car parts.
However, the counterfeiter has secured Chinese brand rights to Freudenberg.
We would forget it ourselves, because the last name cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The stamp office also rejected the opposition of the Munich company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg has managed to exercise rights, but the opposer is still fighting in the dispute.
You have to be careful.
The matter is now being discussed at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler trusts that the matter will lead to a good ending and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The driving is extremely expensive and we cost us a lot of time, money, and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company archive, they even had to look at a hundred-year-old files to submit evidence.
Five years ago, Freudberg in vain offered "a high six-digit amount in euro" to settle the dispute.
"You see what that means to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East are threatening to hit Europe as well.
And that's if the imitators get their unprotected plates there.
For example, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to apply the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This area of business has long given up, yet it has been able to reverse the registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and the lawyer, Pattloch, advise German companies to be very careful in their business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Foreigners should rather "all that is worth protecting, even applying in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg, in the last act of his drama with the brand, is likely to have to pay license fees for his own name by the counterparty, He explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in a disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Assassin, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, he tests the Imbongi Congregation - and in Swaziland, they enjoy orphans after their parents who died of AIDS.
The story of a connection that overcomes much more than 8733 kilometres.
First there is an assing: cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's moccasins looking for a dance floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly rise - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - insist, moms and pursue each other.
A 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopfa almost lifts it from his textile shoes when he connects voices with his wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, he is testing the choir of Imbongi a new song.
There were fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69, from a researcher of human genetics to a landlord.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choral voice has a different text, and in addition in a very foreign language - a zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help to self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of which 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245 000 orphans after their parents who died of AIDS.
HIV is more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans who died of AIDS, Esitjeni found the Society of Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second-degree school.
A patronate may be taken over for 15 or 20 euros a month.
She guarantees the baby a school uniform, and one hot meal a day in Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means "the storyteller" or "the one who praises" in the language of the zulu.
No one can speak in this space with a gas bantustine but sing.
For almost ten years now, the congregation has been practicing songs in this foreign language, and sometimes it also brings them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
In the north-east of Swaziland, the village of Esitjeni, which is dependent on the power of the voices of the German congregation, is 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg.
Forty percent is infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in plain clay or straw huts, many of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, because they have been infected with HIV.
In Esitjeni, it is seen in the small, hundredths of all Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy expected worldwide according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of a male foreskin who have provenly reduced the risk of infection by half will not be accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus weakened immunity. There is no rare reason that they die in less than thirty years.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005. First of all, members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets missing not only parental care, but finishes everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school leaving, they have no chance in the poor country.
At first, it was a private deployment of individuals, which allowed the child to be sent to school for a few euros a year and to give him one hot meal a day.
A year later, however, the "Voices for Africa" association was founded, which has since been looking after orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Syphilis, chlamydia and cape (gonorea) belong to bacterial SPI.
The common viral PIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genitalis herpes or hepatitis.
The ammo and the rascal are among the parasite's SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
Robert's Love Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases, which occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (salary), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively little amongst heterosexual adults, but about 20 percent of newly infected HIV is affected by this group.
Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently among adolescents than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
In addition, there are often human papillomaviruses among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of syphilis infected with syphilis is more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of newly infected HIV users has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than a year ago.
What symptoms point to sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the area of genitalia, difficulty in urination, discharge, abdominal pain and blistering or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can I be protected?
Dangerous diseases can reduce condoms, but do not offer 100% protection.
For the originators of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent rotation of sexual partners.
In case of early diagnosis it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent any subsequent consequences.
Thanks to patronations, charity gifts, and, last but not least, to the officers who earn the congregation by singing all over Germany, some money will be gathered.
"We have already sent approximately EUR 200,000 to Esitjeni," says the President of the Association of Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zdwa Domini, a self-confidence woman who can enforce himself.
It also ensures that mature children find shelters, such as some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as in the language of the zulu, is known as old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children arrived on time every day in uniforms at school.
Children who no longer have children go to Khanyisile shelter, to a lonely woman who pays the same as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover, "Voices for Africa" founded the school of sewing, built two hens and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged that many people in the village had had an HIV test.
Even if the disease in the whole country is so obvious, everyone keeps quiet about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because he has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, quite strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, the King of Mswati III, is known for his immoderate lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life also blames, among other things, that HIV has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But there are many migrant workers who have spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are on every corner for free, but nobody uses them.
Culture is different--unprotected contact."
In order to support cultural exchange at least a little, the Imbongi congregation travels once every two, three years together in the south of Africa and sings songs full of grief, fighting, trust in the future and confidence of the black, which many in the southern tip of the Black Continent still know from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of blacks - this kind of appreciation brings not only mood and joy, but also tears from many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjen, where singers visit children who are patronized.
Although you can hardly find this village on the maps, the Ezulweni Valley is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's light," people say.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is from here airline 8733 kilometres, to the ass-songers in the Bergheimer Straße rehearsal room, you can see that the light is shining here.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there's ice on planet Mercury.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The American National Aviation and Space Office (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as it follows from three studies published by the specialist magazine Science on Thursday.
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the area of this planet that lies in the permanent shadow.
It's supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even 20 meters strong.
This water appears to have come from comets or perhaps from asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let us not give the finding of ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the leaders of scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Fahrenheit.
However, findings could help us to clarify how water and other essential elements of life have come to other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes, and little robots like Phoenix, undetected earthlings, are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send pictures to Earth, a small window to endless passages.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the midget planet Ceres.
Just like Pluto, who is walking around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planetou" according to the new concept definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This cut from the infrared picture of Spitzer's telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, the most identifiable are pink-coloured "revoirs" in the obstetric hall of the stars.
This area where stars are formed - scientists call it unromantically W5 - discovered Spitzer's telescope in Cassiopeia in the distance of 6,500 light-years.
This changing heat of dying stars caught Spitzer's NASA telescope.
The Volkov ring consists of a material that exterminated the star during the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid nebula, which is 5400 light-years away from Earth, the new star is formed from gas and dust.
He took a picture of the galactic "ball" by Spitzer's telescope NASA.

One of the biggest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: the vortex galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies become real art parts, according to their colouring.
The selection published by the European Southern Observatory shows a few thousand years of light-years away triffid nebula in the constellation of the Shooting.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triple), because the dark stripe of dust divides the heart of this starry obstetrician into three parts.
In Hadonose’s constellation, astronomers photographed the foresight of space: in the distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the woman of the core of two flowing galaxies must be overtaken and there must be an inevitable collision.
This birth of the star recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy of M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical shortcuts can call it the name South Winder.
Photographs from Hubble's space telescope show the cutout of Iris' nebula in the constellation of Cefea.
This 1400 light-years remote nebula consists of dust grains, which are ten times to a hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It displays a ring from the black holes, which is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810 scientists.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
A cradle of stars gives rise to ever-increasing new arrivals.
Also, these starry clouds, associated with Rosette's nebula, give birth to ever-new young stars, are 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
There is no dust in this bright glowing galaxy with a little black hole, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was created only shortly after the Big Bang when there was predominantly hydrogen in the universe.
Our views into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope reportedly invented in 1608 Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been increasing - and the views that they mediate are getting deeper.
The world's largest telescope was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror on this picture was an average of five meters.
Large Binocular Telescope stands in Arizona.
It allows you to look into the universe with two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet, its average reaches about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of the cheap way of construction: the telescope is secured by a fire-basin at a height angle, thereby reducing its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high intensity of light flow.
Despite the relatively small size of the mirror, this is equal to the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Using radio telescopes in Arecib (Portorico) scientists are searching for alien signals in the universe.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.

Very Large Telescope stands here, doing his name's honor.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also brighten the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned for the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror shall have a full 40 feet [42 m] and shall be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
The two Keck telescopes of the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They're offering two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks at the universe with the Subaru telescope and IRTTF.
The Mauna Kea also has a new giant telescope - with a 30-meter mirror diameter.
Here you can admire it in the image.
However, the most important impressions of space are mediated by the Hubble space telescope.
The takings of distant worlds have been giving us since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope is searching for extrasolar planets from March 2009 - especially those that are inhabitants.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The picture documents the latest preparations before launching the Kepler space telescope.
The space telescope of James Webb (JWST) will first be launched into space on board the Ariane rocket in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope is the diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for light of the first stars and galaxies in the Big Bang.
Scientists are based on the fact that the ice is at the south pole of Mercury.
But there are no reliable data for that, since the Messenger is circling this planet far closer to the northern pole.
Radar measurements have been showing for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004, and is the first to run around Mercury, scientists are now confident.

Finding clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
We can call driving a mountain Talyš wildly romantic.
The minibus is rumbled along the road with many turns along densely wooded hills, gruesome rivers and simple common constructions.
Everything's green and juicy, it almost seems we're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here lives the Caucasus ethnic group of Talyš, which is not known much, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and is living a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is being chased by too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit in a picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come here. The arrival from the city of Baku from Azerbaijan is too easy.
Eight hours is required for 323 kilometers, because the road is only one route.
The fortunes of the land that they owe nexus in the Caspian Sea have not yet arrived here in the countryside.
But Pilate Fatulajevo (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Great Eurovision Award in May - and we will have the oldest people festival in the world next year," says Fatulajevo.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, about the only one in the world.
Here is documented life of almost eight dozen Talyš from the surrounding area, who are over a century old. Fatulajeva shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he was still a child.
However, the common star of this museum is the shepherd of the sheep of Müslümov, who was allegedly 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And since the oldest man with the documents was 122 years old, the age of Müller seems extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area of 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulajevo.
This man was reportedly three times married, and he had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he was still a child of a daughter.
So was Müslümov a few decades of age wrong?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, the gerontologist of the Institute of Max Planck in Rostock, heard of the elderly people in Central Asia.
"In some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, some people of age live in some areas," says Scholz, "also there are extremely many very old men living in Sardinia."
However, due to missing materials, no scientific evidence of age can be given, especially when the matrix is missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
However, the fact is that people in the area around Lerik often experience the Bible’s age.
There are currently 20 people over 100.
Why, then, do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijan’s Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by special Talyš genes.
On the contrary, the museum director Fatuljevo believes it lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that the calorie diet of Talyš, who love meat, bread, and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, does not exactly seem plausible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajevo.
In 97 years, it is still relatively young to this latitude.
Mirzajevo, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butterball that he tirelessly collapses.
There are eight people living here under one roof, including one of the sons of Mirzayva and the daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
There's two little kids jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical belly glasses of "armada".
The white teeth of Mirzayev's Mirzay are the perfect line, and under the scarf there is a long, dark, blond copy that proudly reveals to us her son.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like they kept the color.
"I never used shampoo either," says Mirzajevo.
A monthly pension to life is enough
She always ate just what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
In my whole life, I haven't even bought food in a supermarket.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst part was World War II.
But everything got better when the oar took over the "loved father" of Gejdar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from the old woman's mouth.
However, the cult, which is done around the figure of the father of the nations who ruled his country as dictator, does not know the limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then took over his son Ilham's row.
Old people in Azerbaijan do not at least suffer from need.
Mirzajevo receives a pension of 230 manats each month (approximately the same amount in euros).
And maybe even the long - gray son of Mirzajeva is right: "The old people are very serious in our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, loved, cared and happy.
If it's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term "human rights" in the Constitution is missing
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Disarmed demonstrations in Cairo revealed the deep split of the country.
The future constitution based on the law of Sharia is being discussed strongly.
The Egyptian president did not spare the pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And for our success, I am responsible in front of people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but above all to the Christian hooves, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, so far hopelessly arguing in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "God's State" on the Nile at the mercy of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi almost excused that he temporarily restricted the competence of the constitutional court and extended his own to "saving the revolution".
But what a 61-year-old engineer who has the degree of doctor of the U.S. University in Southern California really wants to save is neither Egyptian nor the world is clear about that.
Is justice to be deprived of power?
234 paragraphs, which the hundred-headed Constitutional Assembly with the predominance of Islamists quickly approved in the 15-hour nightmarathon, partly raise concern.
As in earlier constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principle" mean?
It was and it is a matter of interpretation and it can be feared that Islamists will use this unclear formulation and the associated legal space for a more stringent interpretation of the charm.
At the very least, this is explained by the newly added paragraph: In all the matters relating to Sharia, we need to consult with the al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the whole Sunni Islam.
It may not be, but it may mean that the klerus will exercise the supervision of the legislator, which would result in a de facto withdrawal of its right.
There are many interpretations in the draft Constitution
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of the military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubarak's governments to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As it stands in the proposal, it should also stand to protect the "right nature of the Egyptian family and to promote its morals and values".
This is so legally formulated that, through this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In comprehensible speech, it means nothing but censorship.
Moreover, no paragraph in writing defines the explicit equality of men and women.
However, another paragraph prohibits the defamation or slander of the prophet Mohammed and his ambassador.
However, what is shameful and what will be prosecuted remains unclear.
It is also doubtful to formulate that "reflection of people" is prohibited.
In this case, is there enough caricature of the President or a joke on the account of experts of the law?
The point of interpretation, like much more in this proposal, which Morsi will submit for signature and, according to his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the sake of folk voting.
"The revolution has returned."
For several weeks now, the opposition has been formed against the power of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it began to pay.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbahi, who placed third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize Carrier and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed Baradej stated that the draft constitution belongs to the site of history.
Through the services of short news, Twitter accused Morsi's supporters that they wanted to perform a 'pussy against democracy'.
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw him down," said Jasir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," quote the Egyptian media of the opposition policy of Chálid Ali.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee a referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared infertility, but of caution not in Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the second bank of the Nile before the University of Cairo.
She was attended by many disguised women and supporters of the Salaphits who cried, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They said to Morsi: "Put the earth clean." They said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrir, on which everything began, would probably trigger a state of civil war.
The Morsi supporters obviously didn't want to take any chances.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents and the supporters of the draft constitution had made a loud and clear statement.
Now it is time to let the people at the electoral urn decide which direction the country should go.
The majority in favour of the Islamist proposal is considered to be certain.
"The word "human rights" does not happen once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, goes to Háfize Abu Sa'du.
The eightty-year-old human rights defenders and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation (EOHR) were defending members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in prison for Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are ineligible for him.
For that he was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution, the words 'human rights' aren't even once," complains in an interview for 'Welt am Sonntag'.
Mursi's expansion of power to all three power forces in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous crime against democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Locally, the president of civil society will strengthen it, effectively cancel it," Sa'da complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned even by the international community, which follows the game of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could get out of his way.
The demonstrant in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you cannot control anymore."
Norwegian Cancer: The most stinking fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the mystery of the success of the country be connected to the local appetite for extraordinarily smelling fish?
Take some cheese.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Leave it to me for a week.
That's how you get the smell of paralyzing cancer, one of the biggest Norwegian delicates.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is a snow, a wonderful view - and in the air there is a ubiquitous smell.
The cancer is a salted trout leavened in water for up to one year - depending on how much you want fish to smell.
As it gets dark and gets cold, the Nores here in Fagernes are beginning to meet at a festival dedicated to how to say it to the best, most sublime food.
"You will eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of water," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman, but also the so-called "Rafisk general", who is responsible for the festival's course.
People all around us eat small cubes of fish and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people prefer the aquarium rather than the carpentry," says Havard.
The drink can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi that was on a long bus trip.
The cancer is a product of a very different time when poverty was in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators, the fish were soaked in airtight barrels with water and salt in the fall.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well-fermented, they went out and ate their senses - they no doubt were stunned by alcohol.
Before just one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country looking for work, most of which emigrated to the United States.
At present, the population is rapidly growing - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted to a large number of jobs, high wages and an extensive care system.
Residents of Sweden, an old rival, which was much richer than Norway a long time ago, flow to the country for work.
The cancer is seen as something important, indispensable, although quite stinking part of the Norwegian past.
It's one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich you will come out for £9 (14) a piece.
Norway often fails to get into the global news - and it seems that most people do.
The name Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist, who shot 77 men, women and children last year, still mentions people with reluctance.
Instead, shooting is called the July 22 event.
The Norwegians can only find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
The current wealth of Norway lies in the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says our waitress Anna, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, who is a prototype of Nordic welfare.
We are, as you say, considerate people.
Her English, as well as the English of most of the locals, is absolutely perfect.
We don't show off, we don't like show.
Norway deals with its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading to the global financial downfall was throwing away money that they didn't have, the Norwegians had strings tightly drawn on their bowls.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go on trips in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eating the carpentry," he adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in front of something to eat - I've had enough cancer.
I'm sure this lotion burger is something else, and it's beautifully juicy.
But tonight, the stinking fish is back here.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where you serve carnivores for dinner and where guests choose the best or more for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They're connected to a live television broadcast in which the host with the butterfly is surrounded by a plate with a carnivore.
It's like a Eurovision singing competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man will fall off the chair, possibly driven by an aquatite.
Or maybe fumes from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nito from Mexico has a hard start
As the upcoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is blocked even in the best times, steel barriers were raised closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent those arriving in getting into work, but to prevent those protesters from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Neto will receive the presidential sword and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a challenging task.
Mexico has done well in economic terms at the time of Felipe Calderon’s retreating office, but the country is in a pair of drug wars, which has already estimated to be the victim of 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said President Pena Nieto to American President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before shaking his hand with the American President, President Pena Neta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old home, the people's and the vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in a good way.
Citizens assign him the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built. These motorways are a huge improvement compared to the rough and bumpy roads that were here earlier.
They also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with a theme of climate change.
"We expect him to bring about a real and lasting change," says Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, State Member of President Pen Niet, institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI Party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Olvera's MP admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos Presidential Palace, Enrique Pena Nieta expects a lot of things inside.
And he refuses to express a opposition characterized by a new president as a man without material content.
He is a very straightforward man, very interested in the excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great statesman, and he's a man who listens.
But on the other hand, this is not an impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotlo, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
In many cases, a suburb of Mexico’s capital city itself, stuck under the motorway overpasses.
And the problems in the village itself are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called up to help handle drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, especially the violence against women.
Only in the last two years were the bodies of dozens of murdered women dumped in the desert next to the vast waste disposal.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, which is much more than in the notoriously violent town of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, Pena Net's critics say that he failed to deal with women's murder in his office.
And in the worst case, his leadership is accused of closing their eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a deranged neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like her body was washed," remembers Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of a blow, and there was already a postmortem stiffness.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they have been denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker and a whiner.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
"But it can't be right when there were so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
The sword that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime, and the new president has promised that for his time in office they will be his priority.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was," says MP PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what families of victims in Ciudad do not fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of ill treatment, says the military prosecutor
The military prosecutor is trying to deny Bradley Manning's claim of gross custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be rejected on the basis of gross treatment of Manning in prison.
The Private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest release of classified material in the history of the United States, has missed many possibilities to complain about the gross treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor Ashden Fein, during a cross-trial interview with Private Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of the unit during the nine months of his custody in Quantico, Virginia show no complaints about mistreatment.
In the course of the hearing on the defence, the cross-examined case against Manning was rejected because of gross custody at the time of the arrest, which is sufficient in itself, the day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in the custody.
Military Intelligence Analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At the Friday hearing, military prosecutor Fein and Manning passed the forms that the officers filled in after meeting with Manning in the Quantic prison, where he was held in an increased security regime between July 2010 and April 2011.
Officer Manning asked questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that the treatment of his guards was "excellent" and valued overall treatment in the facility as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints about ill treatment, although Officer Manning's officers directly asked how he was treated, claimed Fein.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns about the various problems orally and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not notice these problems.
"They wrote down "no problems" and it did not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned them," Manning said.
Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 at a meeting with a committee assessing suicidal thoughts which he had expressed several months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "injury prevention" mode.
The military stated that it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under the regime of supervision for suicide) to protect and protect others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was fine and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life I saw," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and the transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transported to the custody prison at the base of the Marine Infantry in Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait, and one time he passed out because of heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would be with him and what was happening in the surrounding world was very daunting.
"My world has only died at the base of Arifjan, on that cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantica he spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small business without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, blanket, incandescents, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying was against regulations during the day.
Manning said he always slept with a light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint on the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he made in his Thursday statement concerning that, after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners in the morning counting.
Manning said he wasn't allowed to cover himself with his blanket when he counted.
On a Friday interview conducted by Judge Manning, he said that he thought that he had a blanket to cover up, but he admitted that no one had given him an order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he wasn't dangerous.
Manning said he told an officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his props to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that that night his underwear, his incandescents, and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that, in the event of his conviction before a military court whose beginning is expected at the beginning of next year, he will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense stated that it planned that Manning would plead guilty in lower crimes and that he would fight against other charges because they were too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the terms of custody as justified.
The Pentagon stated that Manning had been held in accordance with the rules applicable to all arrested persons held in custody with maximum security.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, the illegal release of intelligence documents online, the transfer of information on national security and theft of public property or records.
If he is charged at all points, he may be sentenced to life.
My Crisis Mexican-American Identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of possibilities that are there.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of the difficult times, they say.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico City, I barely lost the crowd and arrived in space for the immigration agenda, where I encountered the problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for the Mexicanos ("Mexicos") and the other for the "Extranjeros" ("Cizinci").
I was standing there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in high school California, and I've been called Mexican my whole life.
It's an ethnic shortcut, just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry," and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy."
So I ended up with the term "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, it wasn't necessary to use a shortcut.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my U.S. passport and stood on the front for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment that the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Neto visited President Obama's White House this week.
The programme was attended by usual issues which are being discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why there is the same probability that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico as they would travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trading block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he didn't provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite half the Mexican territory in the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the range of centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.
So one minute after the U.S. official says something a little bit critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans interfere with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's children will set foot on the war path.
And yet, Mexico is the real challenge of a relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree was a person, perhaps parent or grandparents, who had been denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it seems, this person matched the profile - dark skin, weak education, origins from the poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And while we're living an American dream now, we're going to good schools and we're doing a good job, we can never forget the fact that we're living an American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
Besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a resemblance to defeat and view us as an underprivileged race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bonds to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our existence is merely a failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they would never have left him.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and was legally travelling to the United States in her childhood, reminds me that there is a tension between Mexicans and Mexicans, because Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican Americans hate it.
Even though she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many Mexican Americans I know do not feel as part of either.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best from both countries, but you don't have the roots in either.
In Mexico, he looks at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexican.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and push political leaders to strengthen their relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
Fair enough.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States how they dealt with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel they still do not vote for the way their family members were treated in a much closer way.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
The old battles, the new Middle East
Ending fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that every such thing is futile.
More than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis, were killed among the usual unnecessary guesses of who started this, and first the missiles from Gaza near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although it seems that the Israelis and Palestinians have been trapped in their ancient conflict, all around them the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has changed old order, and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the region's future chaos.
Maybe it'll make their fight even more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to believe that this may interrupt their deadly stalemate situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that there are currently not many reasons to maximize.
Even if the ceasefire shut down on November 21st, the fighting this week strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazan inhabitants in one of the most heartfelt and humanly corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his turbulent rivals from Fatah, more moderate Palestinian factions.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can very well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world have gained greater influence, making Hamas powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has joined Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The people of Hamas say that the Islamic half-month is circling around Israel, north of Lebanon, where the Party/Milice Hezbollah rules over Syria, where rebels who are increasingly bowing to Islamism can take Bashar Assad down to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening kings.
And above all, at the southern wing of Israel, he changed the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, far from the most populous and major Arab country, balance in the region.
Hussy Mubarak, a secular despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time at Hamas.
On the contrary, Brotherhood is Hamas’ cousin and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy Hamas can appear as a player who cannot be voted out either by Israel or by America.
On the contrary, the hardliners of Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In the military terminology Hamas was put back in the box.
The Israeli missile system Iron dome proved its price and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology America is as unwavering as ever. Many European countries also blamed Hamas for the launch of the last round of violence.
And above all, Israel has flourished, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although missiles from Gaza since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, Israel has been quite quiet from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that has interfered with the West Bank, the main part of what the Palestinian State might someday be, and protects Jewish settlements that are still growing despite their illegality from international law.
The Prime Minister of Netanyahu, whose party Likud joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the election campaign on 22 January.
Why spoil those traitorous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they have launched missiles like their countrymen did in Gaza?
It's better if we keep 'em behind that wall and hit 'em with their heads up.
Maybe hardline supporters will win, but the Arab spring can change their calculations.
While Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have Israel too much in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israeli defense spending is higher than all of its four Arab neighbours' expenses combined.
The launch of a new war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economies.
The fact that President Morsi worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and can be the beginning of something new.
The Israelis should also look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates a denial of the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination of a barrel with gunpowder, which one day needs to explode in areas occupied by Israel - like a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
At present, repression is weakening in the Jewish state of democracy and demography is exacerbating this situation as the Arab population is growing.
The bloody outbursts against Gaza taking place every few years in order to push Hamas against them will increasingly collect diplomatic taxes.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what reasonable people say on both sides, the majority of the outside world and the following newspaper: two states where Israel will advance its territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping fire will give pressure from outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must base itself on halting arms supply to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967 with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs on the outside must also press on the match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would make more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations for the creation of a Palestinian State.
President Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table.
During his first parliamentary term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to enter the process.
That's patheticly shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarette packaging have entered into force
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are displayed with warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
The Australian laws on ugly tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind, have entered into force, and the logos and colors of the brands have replaced the general olive green boxes with the detestable images of the sick parts of the body and the image of children and newborns with the result of smoking their parents.
In addition to the various health warnings and images, the only difference between boxes of brand names that are printed in the same small font is from Saturday.
This is the most stringent regime in the world regarding tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to dissuade young people from smoking by ridding this habit of attracting him.
It's based on studies that show that if people don't start smoking until they're 26, 99% chance they'll never start smoking.
"Even with very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell with their product," says the Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek and quotes studies that have shown that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world, and changes will only have a small impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry has been hard lobbying against the implementation of these laws.
The tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade in the black market, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"Thanks to this legislation there will be serious unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will deliver much more of these products that will be sold on the streets of Australia.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone cigarette packaging for cover of disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals regarding the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico sold nearly 6,000 pieces to wholesale dealers and expected new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As possible, experts point out the popularity of the social media in the demographic group that the plan is focused on.
Throughout a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes from a direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has prohibited Internet advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space to promote your products, online space is an insurmountable place where you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman recorded an increase in brand ratings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honza".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job and created this video, or is that a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the sector focused on how it will deal with new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector went so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the assault of the new rules - countries within the World Trade Organisation declare that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of Australia's countries are significantly traded.
The SOO Decision is expected to be implemented in mid-2013.
Minister Pliberek says that the government has conducted talks with other governments that are considering similar laws regarding packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They now spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
Images have no influence on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and put the box back in," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with photographs of a tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason I should stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that thanks to the uniform box, he's making it harder for him to balance the shelf.
"It took me one hour to load the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, "OK, that's it, we'll close the shop," he said, and he'll tear his hands apart.
In the world of constant connection it is not so bad to be bored
The last day of Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we've had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite distracting books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts in children's development are increasingly coming with praise for boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It makes the brain go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And given that most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we have no chance of getting bored.
So should we be bored to support it?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I have assumed that boredom is a rather new phenomenon that has occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (The History of Boring) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompey there was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, coming from the first century of our Common Era.
And then there's also the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at research literature and presenting the ideas of the target group about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it".
Boring is different from apathy by not being involved, but wanting to be.
He says there's no urge to do anything about apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is "the disruption of the attention process associated with the bad mood and feeling of slowly running out of time."
Boring can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a mutual relationship, boring people tend to see a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem within themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Bored in Terms of Athens", which was published in September in the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape on which the person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups have heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others have heard it so quietly that they have barely noticed it, while the third group has not heard it at all.
Those who heard the television program silently reported more boredom than the other two groups - had difficulty concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
When you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or enticing task, you may disturb attention to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscientifics at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "like finding the wrong components on the factory line, distracting music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and snooping, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more careful.
"The survey shows that children who are allowed to drill will learn more and maintain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We've all been bored ever since - late flight, banging speaker, especially a long film.
But some individuals have a better chance of getting bored than others.
To help measure the boredom of scientists in the 1980s developed the "Boredom Pronness Scale".
The scale includes questions like, "I have many things to do, it repeats and is monotonous," and "I have so much interest that I don't have the time to do them all."
Using these scales scientists have learned that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally insensitive.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found out that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored at school and doing homework while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentage expression of boredom was now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
He said, however, that he knows that "contribution is the peak time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boredom good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, play gambling or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Nuda is the way of the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a moment, not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't even be too critical to her.
Our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are from the reach of constantly crushing activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for is a way to relax and enjoy leisure time.
"In an environment where we are constantly oversimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain when the noise turns off."
There is no manual in Colorado regarding the new marijuana Act
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a high-school student and footballer from south-eastern Colorado, face accusations of crimes for something that will soon be legal throughout the country - for having several grams of marijuana and the pipe he used on her smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one day of September he went with several friends in Lamar, on plans near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was given an appeal for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offences with USD 100 for each fine - and he was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the spot rather than on the law.
Hundreds of offences for marijuana possession have already been lifted here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures.
The police department stopped accusing adults of 21 years of age and older for holding a small quantity that will be legally authorised after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors at the more conservative districts of Colorado have said that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and they are still accusing people of possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver vote towards the western mountains to prevent the opening of new state-licensed marijuana shops in their municipalities.
"This matter is evolving so fast that I do not know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief of the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads are gossiping with regulators in Washington State.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all until 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is first of all before most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now also for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the licensing board for the sale of alcohol to the state of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent for us to follow," he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal possession yes.
And there are serious mechanical questions that need to be addressed during this period, such as how to balance the State directive on "corresponding access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trade within 330 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"There will be no more difficulty in placing licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the Centre for Legal Cannabis, a recently established research group.
On November 21st, Police Chief Oates sent an e-mail from Aurora to his officers, in which he announced to them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute crimes for possession of a small amount of marijuana for every citizen of 21 years of age and that the police would "definitely" stop people from blaming these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will enforce city laws governing medical marijuana growers and that they will continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In the district of Weld in North Colorado, District Prosecutor Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
Following the vote, he stated that his office would continue to pursue the prosecution of cases of marijuana possession, mostly as a way of pushing users to seek treatment.
At present, the charges of holding 56 grams or fewer marijuana 119 people, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is required to prosecute a criminal offence that was criminal at the time of the crime," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places like the Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer accused adults of holding a small amount.
The district attorney Pete Hautzinger supports this decision, but he also decided not to reject all ongoing custody cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of the Colorado voters supported the measures, it will never be easy to bring recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system.
And the counter-reactions across the state revealed, given this large state green experiment, deep separation between local officials.
For district prosecutors it is "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, lawyer of Denver, who represents the defendants of marijuana possession, and local spokesperson of the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana laws.
"They've spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to approach a small amount of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on their best track to become national test cases for the legalization of drugs.
Defenders and state authorities are planning new borders for legalised sales, and at the same time, they are anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The lawyers of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will surrender.
Despite several arrests of marijuana vendors for medical purposes and patients using it that attracted attention, the federal government mostly left the medical marijuana business in Colorado, Washington, and other 16 states in operation.
While drug agents probably won't come through the door to catch a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will resist the possibility of allowing state-owned recreational marijuana trades authorised by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former consultant in the field of drug policy of President Obama's administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments have approved moratorium for any new marijuana business, even if it will take about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the West proposed a half-year ban, and it is likely that it will enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we're going to issue a license and then we're going to have a big federal affair," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our village voted against this amendment.
We're looking at what the village voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am conservative."
Today's students are not only attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest place of knowledge, a modern-style symposium that motivated two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, I was in the middle of two weeks after joining Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, pack bags and crash into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and wept.
My friends were confused.
Evening Standard said I gave up because I objected to loving students in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson convulsedly declared that I had left because I was forced to drink from braided cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment, it was both bigot and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I as a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm bringing it up right now.
Just because the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students on the right from the center suffers from similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students have achieved the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the association of younger years (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and shown that they are not welcome".
They call for the creation of a position in the university's equal opportunity committee to ensure that they can share their views freely.
Their situation has not even helped the recently mentioned BBC Two documentary programme called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right: young, intelligent and right-wing, student political events that have been described by conservatives as stranges and neo-Nazis.
A graduate of Joe Cooke, former President of Oxford University Conservative Association, was introduced to the program by the Oxford University Conservative Association, who drove Rolls-Royce, and was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
In other colleges conservative students say that because of the introduction of higher education they are treated as "circumcised lambs".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday news that "the left-wing influence of universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
A 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the greater protection movement, says that such climate is "unfortunate," while the 19-year-old elected president of OUA Stephanie Cherill says that the JCR members' approach to the people on the right of the center has been deteriorated.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18-year-old and in a shameful way.
Hate for the Conservative Party was the most severe.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse the honorable title of former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
Even the Stalinists would be worried about the atmosphere.
During the first few days in the opening week, when new students met with each other and with professors, I got a taste of the full moon that was supposed to come.
I found that not only does professors of silence approve of the sneezing of conservative pupils, but they also like to participate in them.
A policy of mining strike, privatisation and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa has been brought into the wood-closing audiences.
My first lecture was on translation of the French text from the 18th century into English and on what followed I was not ready.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
I was sick enough.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like cake cake, was very yellowish.
"Thatchers refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were hinnies.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you are too busy with social affairs," said Professor Pitt.
I returned to my room.
I sat alone at dinner at school when I felt a slight pat on my shoulder.
He was a second year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the AUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone suspected of conservativeism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labourists.
Later in the local pub, I tried cowardlyly to pretend.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
Student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economics, who (an irony) went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students were taking notes with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
They're beating each other up, aren't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet people who feel the same after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labourist and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years before me developed like a purgatory of ignoring and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, based in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being an advisor to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
He hated the place for its provinity and pettyity and for its attachment to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he joined professor at Bilkent University in Turkish Ankara.
"You will not be happy here," he said.
I started driving from Oxford to my parents' house in London looking for refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were adopted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreams.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His wet eyes were saddened.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance worsened.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, subjected to pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week during the teaching, when the next professor of history declared in absolute seriousness that I was "the enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was in red with shame, I confessed to being brainwashed by "parents" and I called them "old fools".
The relief was only short-term.
My father beat my father into the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns to Murdoch's paper every week.
My door was locked.
I used to hang out inside, and after five minutes, my persecutors gave it up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a dead man.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and poison in the educational institution.
But the more tragic thing is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative premieres came up, but which until today also hides behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance rather than glory"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Nate Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszo and other famous Italian designers.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host Valentin Garavani's exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the start of the celebrated retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion" which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," she says with her irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of a story in which "il signorre" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which will last until 3 March, is overflowing with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social growth: from a simple tailor from the town of Vogher in the north of Italy to an idol of the international "Bohemian Smetana".
To love royal families is nothing wrong.
"They at least don't put a pint of cigarettes in a great carpet like that do some wonderful pop-music celebrities," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cabin in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance than fame.
And he's still a star."
Valeria Mazzová shows Valentina
The charisma of the designer does not forget even the Argentine model Valeria Mazzová.
"It's been many years since one show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his place for dinner.
There were 20 of us and there were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy younger.
In every detail of his apartment, his decoration, his meals, his music, his eyes in everything, and he felt his spirit.
All invited people could feel important and loved thanks to him," recalls the top model, which began working with him during the Paris week of top fashion in 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
The Birth Show
Gravani’s life is not a story of obsession, but of truly restored love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was converted into a seventy metres long passage that offers a role exchange: a visitor will change into a model and marches to observe the "Generality" of dreams, which has Valentin's masterpieces as a dress which Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that Monica Vitti wore in "Night", or a coat of wool and fur, which belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
In the audience, names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit Norska, Rosario Bulgaria or Sophie Habsburska shine.
Nate Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is the first love, "I can't forget about it".
"I remember perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, the vest "gillette" and the jacket from the fall-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Nate Abascal, one of the designer's muse.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity and great love for women, because he underlines our beauty," added the former Duchess of Feria.
"I like the colors he uses, brighten up and give the face a spark.
The balances are perfect."
Not even the princess and the fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she longed to be full-time and to have the opportunity to dress one of his evening dresses...
In the end, she was in the late '90s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentin to celebrate my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a dress called, an embodiment and a topless shoulder.
It was a dream that became real," says the widow after Rodriguez d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax with fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat whose life extends between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has a designer's wedding dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in them".
The King of Fashion
The golden highlight of the exhibition in Somerset House is the Marie-Chantal Miller wedding dress from her wedding with Paul Greece in 1995.
In order to create these silk dresses of ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of different laces and a four-and-a-half-foot tractor were needed four months of work and 25 "girl" (as the designer calls his seams).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialised press, these dresses represent the milestone of the top fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from high society".
Valentino dazzled over the years by the elite "savoir-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honour in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated by the Order of the Honorary Legislature gathers so much honor as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always been drawn to his selectivity, calm, adjusted and perfect look," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was at the gala dinner at the Orsay Museum a month ago.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was perfect, time left no trace of him."
When the princess says...
The world's toughest craft: sulphur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, carriers in the area of Indonesian volcano with their lives and health, putting up 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living growing sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonean island of Java.
That's why they have to go to the bottom of the crater every day, where they avoid the sulphur gases from the inside of the Earth, and when they come into contact with the air, they go into solid condition.
After cutting off the large blocks of sulphur that weighs up to 70 kilos together, it carries them on its shoulders in two bamboo baskets along the paved stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 metres, it is only 250 meters, but it takes exhausted carriers over 40 minutes to rise at a turtle’s pace, because they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps so as not to slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could happen to them, as it happened to one French tourist who crashed from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents per kilo of sulphur to earn
When they are up there, they take the road around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys at the circus, and they tirelessly carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little below, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is a company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the whitening of sugar.
"Because they normally wear 70 pounds, we make about 46,000 rupees for each journey," Anto explains, which usually takes three trips a day.
One journey takes him three hours and at the end is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even if it seems to be a negligible amount for such inhuman effort, it's three times what he would make in the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2) are paid per day and the salary for 14 days is 2 million rupees (167 EUR)," explains the carrier who worked on the island of Bali as a wall.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 EUR) per day and work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason which is as convincing in Indonesia as sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's having a bad breath, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritable with toxic gases.
At 27 years, Anto has three times a day risking his life in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulphur has already begun to collect its tax on him, even though his face has a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritable with toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That's the price she has to pay to achieve her dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," she promises in more than dignified English.
This nice and intelligent young man caught by fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, and he wakes up every day at 2:00 a.m., because sulphur doesn't stop hanging out at night and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and September dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto is flying into the crater, lighting up the little light that he has attached to his helmet and bought it with his own money.
About 400 carriers carry on their shoulders a basket with sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high income, sulfur mining has not mechanized due to cost savings, nor has it provided self-employed and with such effort, no equipment.
In fact, they do not receive a share of 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) from the photo-shooting fee, which together with the ticket for EUR 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2) are selected by the nature park watchmen from tourists who are coming to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for cattle, and not for people," said Madrusin, a sturdy 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 pounds and assure us that he can last as long as possible, because he needs money to train his three sons between 18 and 10 years old.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Although sulphur burns its throat and cuts in the eyes, when the wind turns unexpectedly and traps the miners in dense fumes that come out of the volcano, miners say that none of them complain that they suffer from severe diseases... but it is obvious from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.
An unainic who balances his back basket can only carry 50 kilos in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his colleagues exhale in a volcano of 15 tons of sulphur, which then three lorries take the steep road between the violin and the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometres away.
"I am not going to retire, I am going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainika, opening wide mouth, missing a few teeth.
Of his five sons, he earns his oldest, thirty years old, also earns his sulfur by laying down.
Time passes by, but the constant misery of one of the most difficult crafts in the world persists from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
The Singaporens report that they do not have children, careers, stress, and the cost of living and education.
"The people of Singapore need growth."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of an ad for menthol candy, but yet - or maybe that's why - the video spread to YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of the rap that uses the local insinuation type "let's blow in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
The artistic director of Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to take advantage of the influence of music in order for people to perform their "citizen duty".
"It's all about the Internet business, so it must have been fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem of this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproduction of our population, so we felt that it was a subject we had to touch.
We knew that the government tried a lot of things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like the composition of rap, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
Whoever doesn't take it very lightly is the Singapore government.
She spends $1300 a year encouraging citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
However, all these measures have had a small effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city state with advanced technology in the south-east of Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, given the population's spread, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Last time, the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered to be the rate of recovery, in 1976.
Why don't the Singaporens have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the marriage and family of the National Office for the People's Republic, says it's because of "better education" and "a wide range of career opportunities".
"People have a wider range of options in terms of living goals and priorities, it is not just a wedding and a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to increasing the number of single people and delaying marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there were efforts in immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, it caused dissatisfaction among locals.
Some Singaporean websites have seen uncovered xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping low wages and a small effort to integrate.
An increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why a government party of Singapore recorded its worst electoral result since the beginning of independence.
After the elections, there was an effort to address the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unforeseeable Consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences in Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence real estate business.
The Office for Urban Development has started to regulate the number of small apartments known as " bot boxes", which can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in the marketplace.
However, there is concern that these apartments can support youthful lifestyles and discourage developers to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the EL Developers, claims that their shoeboxes are sold far faster than bigger houses.
"They're more popular, they're selling days to weeks faster than houses with bigger size.
That's why they're so much better for our money flow."
However, he admits that the new standards lay down clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed out.
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could lead to an increase in the birth rate of the nation, an interview with the Singapore people working in the financial district in the city center suggests that they will not have a major effect.
"People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, which is why many people postpone it," says a young official.
"Let the others have children.
But for me it is important to rely on your own money and time," says another, about 20-year-old, young man.
Both men and women mention careers, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever the government's trying to force citizens to have children, they're the Singaporeans who have the last word about family creation.
What is private offline is both private and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something that is personal or "private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disturbance".
What is privacy for a person under 16?
How does this definition apply to everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet issues that he would certainly not tell anyone during ordinary communication?
Reporters from elPeriodico confessed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as "something entirely own" in personal terms and as "user name and password" if it was a social network.
"My biggest secret I wouldn't publish," says Jorge, in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mother may know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I put pretty pictures on the FB or pictures we're playing.
I'm also talking to some friends there.
I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine or a picture that would make anyone laugh," she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 of his friends on the FB and his nine supporters on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
There's a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I have set up an account on Twitter so I can express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone's gonna answer, I'm just putting them in there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns accounts on the hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and the last mentioned network admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them set him up or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they insist on me or require me, I simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
This boy is no stranger to what is now called cyberbullying.
"They blackmailed a friend on the social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirmed.
According to José, the victim didn't log out of the account.
"Only activated a private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps how to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have posted photos of people known in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course, I would have done it if I'd been uncomfortable or if I'd just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in the field of education and teaching, feels that children and adolescents in social networks must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform them.
He states that "the Internet was created as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of an article digital natives and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who need to be taught, while we are only learning," he says.
It explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to discern what it is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what it is not, at the age when they are not mature."
Also, to be - as far as the surroundings are concerned - discreet, at a time when what they desire most is to be liked, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences", he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way is to show children and adolescents what privacy is, to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do something, it doesn't work," he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porras lists some of the possibilities: Are there any things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like it if someone posted your photo the way you posted your friend's photo?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
When you mark people in photos of the celebration, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more thing: does everyone always need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to make them realize that they must behave in the Internet environment as well as outside it.
They're the same rules.
"A person outside the Internet is guided by respect, morals and other principles, and this should be the same on social networks," he claims.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-degree teacher and an educational counselor explains that it is essential that parents of children read the rules of social networks carefully.
"If they understand every monstrosity, they have a good basis to talk to children about the consequences that an account can have.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers".
Summit of South America ends and Declaration of Lima has not been published
The sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Peru today ended without the Lima Declaration being issued and allegedly signed by seven Presidents.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur organization, but representatives of the Foreign Affairs and the presidential office, who initially established that the document would publish after the summit, stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website later.
They also stated that the content was published by the Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in a few short press releases.
Journalists have had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, the video from the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room without the sound of the report "the confidential session, the transmission of the sound was avoided".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press speakers of some of the governments who were present, but not by Peru’s speakers.
The only document published during the negotiations was a list of participants in the presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but it is only about President Humala's statement, not the official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Arabes, ASPA) and even on that occasion, the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, although the press required it.
On the official ASPA website it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but to completely prevent information.
The Summit has ended, inter alia, with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to the adoption of a judgment of the Hague Court, which settles a dispute on the border between the two countries.
The President of Peru Ollanta Humala and the President of Chile Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which on Monday will begin by hearing the defence hearing of both parties to discuss the dispute which Lima had launched against Santiago.
"We will consider and execute the judgment that we are discussing today at this international court," said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts," added Piñera, and greeted President Humal with a hand at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the decision of the International Court of Justice was published after Colombia adopted the Bogoth Pact this week, thus expressing its submission to the judgments of the international court, which decided on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely incorrect.
The summit took place without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from the Unasur organization in 2011 after the appeal of President Fernand Lug at that time and did not attend the meeting.
The Host President of Ollant Humal was charged with opening morning speeches and closing the Lima Summit shortly after noon.
The President has read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 projects between the South American countries were planned with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR Member States would take "essential steps towards a goal in the form of South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are extended".
He informed that actions were supported to improve "co-operation in the fight against civil uncertainty and organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all areas of South America, and to collective and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in a crisis, "it is not to have the economic consolidation (Latin America) of a winning nature, but to serve to expand our productivity and to show our nations a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to prefer a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links between different locations of South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries can be better connected and create new economic links," the President of Peru said.
He mentioned that five of these projects concerned Peru and its transverse axes from coast to Brazil, and the other two concerned a better link with Ecuador, but did not mention more detail.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its return to the Union of South American nations, from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area, which is a wholesome and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, prior to his participation in a regional meeting, hoped to meet with his Nigerian counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico to discuss, with respect, the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning a dispute on the maritime border, which is challenged by Bogota.
"It is possible that I will meet President Daniel Ortega tomorrow ( Saturday)", said Santos.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor the Treaty with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortego to conduct the negotiations in the most civilised and considerate form possible," said Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where the inauguration of local President Enrique Peñi Nieta will take place.
Within the framework of the summit, the EU Defence Ministers have provisionally met to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last one is currently excluded.
Peru is a temporary chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
The Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "in this case South America really has to learn from Europe".
Correa, who took part in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on State TV Perú that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now there are virtually one country".
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that supports the Unasur member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place amongst the members of the Andean Community needs to be achieved, but there are still return areas that want to bring us back to the past," he pointed out.
Among other things, the Ecuadorian President said that he agreed to regroup the American Organization of States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states will be reduced and that those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights will be taken into account.
"The leaders never commit themselves to anything, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is financed by the United States in Washington," said the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, in his reference to political asylum.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange might be issued to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticized Swedish justice, which asked him to be questioned on the Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish legislation allows for an interview with a videoconferencing call that could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange will have worsen physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that she had minor lung problems, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
"But it threatens to make his physical and mental conditions worse because he is locked in a small space without being able to move on fresh air.
That would mark everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to asylum granted to Assange from June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks had taken place with London in order to resolve the incarceration of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate about human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but conversations were ongoing.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón runs a series of proceedings at various European instances," he said.
He said, "if Britain issues a pass tomorrow, it will all end."
And if Sweden listens to Mr Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London or through Skype, as it is possible without a problem, and as has been done in other cases, this problem will be brought to an end tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and he explained that he certainly doesn't tolerate "submeaniveness, evil intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, mean and perverted politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, pressure and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed the joy that even such journalists, "not bankers, nor hegemony countries nor bourgeoisies control Ecuador", and he said that if re-elected, "will continue to change in the right way and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay regarding membership in the Unasur Union at least in its next elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and tolerate opportunism and pučism shrouded into legality" because, in fact, "destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguay democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian President stated that he considered it "to be absolutely appropriate" the wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time after the judgment of the International Court of Hague, which he decided in favour of Nicaragua.
At present, the sentence is not accepted.
"It's a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They should be assessed in broad order to be overcome and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed his hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute that the same Court of Peru and Chile has dealt with and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international cases if both countries undertake to take judgment, however hard it may be".
With regard to the possibility that he will run in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to apply for a third mandate in order, he noted that he sees this option "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa stated that if he loses the election in February 2013 he would leave the public life.
"I have never been personally interested in power, but such an unfair situation as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be rectified by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I had won, it would have been my last presidential period, and then I would have left politics.
If we lose, I'm gonna lose the same thing.
I've made up my mind," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Vice President Nicolás Madur, who says President Chávez went to the planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a president's medical recurrence," he explained.
Today, the head of the Ecuadorian State attended the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was called for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today result from late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the results of his test: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning struck me," says the doctor in his memories of the moment of truth, which he tried to "slow down a little," but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and he began to inform about it, with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most ancient patients of the HIV unit at a Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several struggles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since 22 years, which was something unimaginable at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
The director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him at that time, "because he had a cut wound".
That's when having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and lose it when the virus caused the destruction of the organism and strengthened the immune system and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS disease occurred in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "signs a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who starts on time and in a suitable way with treatment is the same as in healthy people", Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV unit at a Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, said that this information was confirmed in April of this year in prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and specialist at HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that survival and full-time life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with disease, with better use of drug users: people with 200 CD4 cells who can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years of age.
Simply put, it means that one who is diagnosed with HIV in 25 years can, according to these findings, "live without problems until 75 years" explained the doctor in an interview.
To emphasise this progress, it is appropriate to recall that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years old.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the UN Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS-UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only in the State of Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011 and until this May 187 so far. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people continue to die?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in the ways of accessing treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happens in my hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we haven't exhausted supplies of drugs, but the problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they don't know the condition of the disease, or at a late stage of the disease."
It adds convincing information: "Nine of ten patients comes when some associated infection is manifested. All we need to do is to influence overall mortality more is to be diagnosed, so it is necessary to offer large-scale tests to all those who apply for it."
In his proposal, he matches experts and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the State of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio who came to get tests in a private laboratory just because his friend did it, and despite his low age, he had AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi’ s sarcom, a cancer disorder that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather go three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
Change was for better, healthy eating, practicing, taking medication."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with the journal MILENIO JALISSCO, today on the world day of AIDS, to motivate those who are afraid by their testimony.
"Let them take tests, so if they take risks, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, it's better, and if they've been diagnosed, let them know they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message summarizes the password of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Among the programmes for health and common citizens there is a great gap, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalayar journalist who is researching information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In the places that are dedicated to this task "the giving of condoms has actually increased, they have previously given us one or two, today they give us packages and a hundred condoms, which is very well, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms", he said.
Teens are among the most vulnerable to new diseases.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacies and medical staff who want to avoid themselves, says the reporter.
He suggested to change this ineffective distribution. Let the condoms not only be on the counter, but let the hundred of them be in the donors in the public bathrooms, in places where young people often go.
"It's not promiscuous support.
It's not even about "paying beer and motels", as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already lead sexual life," he said.
Key numbers in the State of Jalisco
13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV) have been reported.
This is the fourth place in Mexico in the new and identified cases of AIDS and the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection occurs sexually, 6% of the blood route y 2% periodically.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with the HIV virus, because there are four to five people who do not know about the disease on one registered case.
The judgment approved by the United States Board of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of Group Vitro’s debt by audition in Mexico, calls for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country and a problem of solvency.
Thus, it seems that the restructuring procedures of companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the country of lanes and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment given on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Hale in the bankruptcy court for North Texas leaves, in practice, a Mexican firm without defence, against the possibility of confiscateing their assets on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the door to the Supreme Court of the United States to the main Mexican glass manufacturer with appeal against three irregularities.
At first, it should be said that while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to comply with the Insolvency Law of the United States, the fifth-term appeal court, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is to establish a competition procedure in Mexico.
First, this would point to the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
For this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law, which is determined by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the vote of the branches of the internal corporate structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring would not be reached.
However, Mexican laws admit this possibility.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first one in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, for whose in-house debts the Federal Competition Institute claimed.
In addition, it is true that even after subtracting the votes of the branches, creditors - who opposed Vitro in the United States, i.e. the funds of "sup" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - have not reached the majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
That statement of appeal shall not be taken into account by the court of appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation that has faced since 2008 - the background of the serious economic crisis that hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family company González Sady will refer the appeal to the new assessment directly at the Board of Appeal to carry out the assessment for full participation, i.e. five judges, because they originally voted only three.
If he fails here, he will demand the revision of the higher instance process, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
On the case, it is serious that the court neglected a document sent by the Mexican Government as a service of amicus curiae, in which it details Vitro's procedure under the Conventional Law, which points out that the company has facilitated itself by advocating itself to agreements signed by both countries in order to confront that law with Chapter 15 of the Insolvency Law of the United States.
Moreover, it points out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, which are rules for international cases of insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and state.
Overall rating
Without notice, there were several months of criminal notices of the Mexican Aviation Divisions against the former owner of Gaston Azcárrag Andrad, who was accused of fraudulent conduct, and according to the pilots' union, the vessel has already leaked.
The case led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just brought an action before the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstructions in achieving justice.
According to the Authority, it systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic about the transaction carried out by this operator, in which it selected 198 million pesos from Bank IXE from fideicomis F/589 on behalf of the Mexican aviation company.
The funds were probably directed towards buying shares of Professional Hotel Management (Adreda Professional de Hotels).
As we know, Azcarrag Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The siege of Dragon Mart
On the premises of Universidad de Caribe a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of the association met on the weekend in order to prevent the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Kankún.
We are talking, as is known, about a huge commercial and distribution centre with products from a "large wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which in the lower end would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has been able to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone in order to oppose a monumental area that would partially destroy the protected area and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of the ACTA document
The request to the Senate, which the government did not take into account, which required an explanation of the conditions and circumstances in Japan, by the Mexican Ambassador to the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known under the English shortcut ACTA, has become obsolete according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propedad Industrial).
As is known, despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of treating it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an attempt to pay off long-term debts and not influence the short-terms, Homex is placing investment certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical to offer interest payments every 28 days.
He's born Competival
The merger of leading information technology companies such as NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet was born in Competival, which will aim at the market for software services in Central and South America.
Investment in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The Hector "Hetin" Reyes basketball light was tied to this ball-basket sport for more than 60 years and he traveled the whole world thanks to it.
Not many people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of the local basketball, as has Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was, before he was put up in 2008 by a brain stroke on a wheelchair, enraged in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, a player of the national basketball league BSN, the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league or the president of the Puerto Rican basketball federation.
"I held a lot of roles during my life in basketball, including several at the same time, as I was the president of the national league BSN, the general manager of the national team and the chairman of the federation," Reyes recalled when visiting reporters of the newspaper Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where he lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his loyal wife.
"Basketbal was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photographs and reminders from his long career, testify.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the greatest movement of all he guards those who resemble his action in the los Vaqueros since the mid 1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as co-owner or team owner.
"It was my best years, I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the team los Vaqueros since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
Then the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was a coach here earlier and then worked at the Alabama University of Birmingham, said to me: "I have a 20-foot player for you.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico's ever had.
Bartow then recommended to me by Raymond Gausse's quarterback, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said if Mincy brought Bayamon a victory in the championship, then Gausse would contribute to the next one."
The championship, when Vaqueros played for the team, enjoyed Gausse, but only at a distance, because in 1988 he was already the president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to take full care of his duties and enjoy Mincy's location on the National Team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in the 1989 Olympics in Mexico.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended the quarter, but we should have had a bronze not to be the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throwing," Reyes said.
Is the World Cup team in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who beat Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was a national team in the Panameric Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we dug up a United States team that was quite similar to the one that blew up our bronze at the World Cup.
This team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lópeze and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also there were young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Frankisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to knee injury.
A team that may not have had the perfect composition, but it was able to win the gold medal and bring great joy was a team of Olympic qualifications in 1995 in the Argentine Neuquén.
With soupisque players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and Junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players voted out for fighting in the Panameric games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
How was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His international tournament numbers are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his action in the various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arilla very much of the young.
Which success do you consider to be the biggest in the federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national league BSN had 17 men in one season.
What didn't you do?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a division of youth categories by region.
For example, that the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national playoffs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for trainers, judges' assistants and referees.
Nice to meet you.
What do you do now?
Most I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy grandkids and sometimes go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, was famous for the role of John Ross Egg, better known as "J.R." on the TV series Dallas, in which he was the incarnate man who acted recklessly and was tricked and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as precious oil magnate J.R. Ewing on the TV series Dallas became a symbol of lacquette in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died of an official announcement from the family provided to the Associated Press production company Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon for complications related to cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he played the iconic role he liked," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in the hospital," said Agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, fun, kind, kind and talented and I'd miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in her announcement.
The Hagmans diagnosed with hepatic cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted himself to drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he had a malignant tumor in his liver and Hagman had a transplant.
Years before the Dallas broadcast, Hagman was famous for being a decent guy on TV in a relaxed comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets an attractive girl (the genie) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedys that were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film performance included roles that were well accepted by critics The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was after Hangman's masterful performance in the form of an incredibly repugnant J.R. that led him to the starry peak.
A dramatic series of CBS stations about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propagating slogan "Who shot Jejár?", which was supposed to create expectations of the work of emotion, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculation viewers around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in betting offices.
This also helped achieve a record in observation.
On the average, on November 1, 1980, in which the response was revealed, Dallas was followed by 41 million television viewers, and Dallas became the second most monitored entertainment show of history after the end of the MASH broadcast in 1983, which followed 50 million viewers.
At J.R., his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played the Eggga, an insatiable greedist with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to keep his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, to be locked up in a hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone", said Hagman in 1988.
It should be, "Here lies J.R. Ewing's honest citizen."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on canvas and outside of it".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were lucky to know and love him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series broadcast TNT stations a few months ago with great success.
"The shooting of five parts of the second series has already been completed and the sixth one has just been shot," she informed the television station.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT station about how the series will continue.
A family member from Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, Ben Hagman's lawyer.
In the early 1950s Larry tried luck on theatre scenes in New York and then served in England at the Air Force between 1952 and 1956.
That's where he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, who he married.
A married couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where there are many celebrities.
In 2001 he published an autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew might hurt or harm anyone," he said to Prens Asocida.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they go into surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy".
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
A course that examines "the end of the world"
Every week students explore apocalypse topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When Professor Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course on the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: The end of the Mayan "long number" calendar to come on December 21, many people were caught as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: the catastrophyl hurricane Sandy, the budgetary gap that some call the "debted Armageddon", and the growing conflict that Israel is involved in, the place where, according to Christians who are theoretical about the end of the world, the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptous semester that he'd ever been," Charmé told Rutgers University students in Camden, New Jersey.
When one unravels what is happening in the world today, as if we had 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, bad means apocalyptic good.
And it's not the only professor who's offering courses on the end of the world this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, an assistant to Barry Vacker organizes a course "The measures, culture and the end of the world".
Every week students explore apocalypse topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We consider why these thoughts are expanding with time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that manage certain human behavior.
If, for example, nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war may erupt.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalypse themes and explore how different they are from real life examples.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University in Pennsylvania, professors of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, expert assistant of art history and anthropology, joined together to organize a course with the simple name End of the World.
"We don't connect "2012," because we always count on the possibility of holding a course again if the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the threat of destruction, students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work "until the very evening of the anticipated end of the world", said Restall.
Courses have become quite popular.
"He spread out in two hours," said Restall about his course for students with high averages who applied for 35.
Week and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we were e-mailed to ask if there was room.
Students themselves ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," she said at Rutgers University in Camden, 23-year-old Brigid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
So apocalypse, worldly or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalypse movies.
"I've never heard of an hour in which to teach," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confessed student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the date of the end of December 21st.
"Our first project discussed mayan predictions and in a certain way we reject it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the University of Temple of West Chester.
"The mayans have never foretold the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back a few centuries, which people react to changes in their surroundings with forecasts about the end of the world.
Flowering these speculations caused the Internet.
"Jinde doesn't think about it," he said.
This is happening in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at La Salle University, who is lectured in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew about a course about the "end of the world", answered quickly.
"Filipins do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote and suggested an exception to the Supreme Bureau.
We have the grace of the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years, there was talk of many days of the last court, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or to philosopherise that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several said they intended to go to the end of the world.
"I think I'll call some friends to laugh at each other," explained Samira Ford's 20-year-old communications student.
