Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, also the Škoda hit.
Defender Filip Novák helped with the goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonsporu to the title of Deputy Master.
His team won 2:1 on the Kayserispor field and held the third Besiktas behind him.
Attacker Milan Škoda gave the 10th goal for Rizespor after the January transfer from Slavia, which he saved, although he fell 1:3 on the field of Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed the excellent productivity of the defense with the seventh goal in this league class.
In 63 minutes the goalkeeper Kayserispor just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer shot the ball into the net from an angle.
The house managed to balance five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of setting up to pull the win off his side when he successfully finished the four-on-one straw.
The damage at the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce settled after the salt at 1:1.

The competition will end on Sunday's duel of the Basaksehir Championship on the Kasimpas field.
A well-covered cave near a deserter in the woods near New Bor was not really a resident
In the north of Bohemia in the foothills of Lusatian Mountains, not far from the New Bor in Czechoslovakia, there are several sandstone rock formations in the forests led by the Countess Road.
Natural and artificial.
And we will follow the human hand created.
The place is called Cave by the deserter.
In fact, there was never any hermit used to live here, and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely the hideout chamber probably on the grain.
The cave is carved from side to side into a rock shelter and accessible on the stairs from top.
But it's practically impossible to see until the last moment.
It will be revealed by the narrow stairs leading to a sort of rock gallery, from where it only enters the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from the human dwellings, at the time of origin it could have been on the high platform where there is a forest, a field.
"The fact that this object does not have a window and even in a traditional space located in the sink clearly shows that no hermitor could ever survive winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek of the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone bench, which is probably used to delay the containers.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," says Kamil Podroužek.
There are traces of instruments on the cave walls.
It was quite simple and fast for the people to break the sandstone.
It was enough to use the clutches and sandstone gradually peel away.
According to the length of the track on the tip, and in any way the chopping can be determined in a frame period of the formation of the cave.
According to historian, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and, according to the mess that appears in it, there is a person who sleeps occasionally in these times.
If you approach the cave from one of the forest roads and get caught under a cave running stream and a nearby County Way, you will certainly find a path down.
And on the way out of the forest, perhaps the nearby Havrain rocks will catch you.
Fry Minarik is after a heavy fall in Germany in artificial sleep
"Filip is now in the best hands.
The Institute is in similar cases, and luckily, we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This greatly makes it easier for me to take care of the daughter of Finju," said the server Jedci.cz.
"They all do maximum, Philip now needs time to recover.
There's no point in giving any prognosis.
Anyone who has ever encountered a problem of head trauma and artificial sleep patients knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all need to be patient now and give him time," said the woman of a 45-year-old jockey.
To financial support the injured Minarik called on Twitter and the star Frankie Dettori, who won the 7th race in Ascot on Saturday, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, which settled the legend of Lester Piggott.
On the Gofundme server, almost EUR 70,000 have been selected for today.
The target is €100 000 (2.6 million).
Video referee took the football players Sassuola four goals, lost 0:2
Sassuola football players, although in the Saturday match in Naples, got the ball four times in the opponent's goal, but eventually they had to accept the defeat of 0:2.
Neither one of their goal judges after consulting the video for the sake of the offensive.
According to the Italian media, it's a record enemy of technology, so many hits have never been lost by a VAR team.
"The VAR was tougher than the road radar on Sassuolo and punished him like no team yet.
New technology breaks records," comments Gazzetta dello Sport.
"Festival of unrecognised goals of Sassuol.
The VAR has never been so strict on one team," said the letter Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead on Saturday in the 8th minute, but after half an hour of the game, Sassuolo seemed to have settled.
The goal of Philip Djurichich, however, was not recognized after the intervention of the video referee because of the offensive.
For the same reason, there was no gradual payment of another Djuričich's intervention and the hits of Francesco Caputa and Domenic Berardi.
On the contrary, they added another goal.
Electromobiles reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they recharged most in history.
"The growth continued to increase both the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said the Head of the clean technology department of CEZ Tomáš Chmelík.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, the manufacturer of Tesla electric cars, but also Bill and Lidl supermarkets, report their part on the market.
The operators of classical pumping stations are again represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
"Our network for electromobility started building only last year," explained Jan Jusková.
However, the daily edition exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by CEZ.
It's from them that drivers from stations picked up on average 13.5 kWh.
That's consistent with the arrival of about 100 kilometers of a smaller electric phone.
If the small pumping takes up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling then took place in a free tariff.
If motorists already paid for the collection, their typical spending was around 330 kroner.
Electromobility extends mainly in the capital.
In the territory of Prague there are all five of the most demanding rechargers of CEZ, which are also popular for the whole regional city.
Among the regions, Olomouc leads.
On the contrary, the least interest is the remote station in the border, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remains without use all day long.
More than four thousand electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
For the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars arrived.
In the extensive poll of "Czechs on the Move", eight percent of readers reported that they were considering buying an electric car into the family.
Only a third of the respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station.
Not only for better water retention.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
According to the organizers, the government’s action to protect and heal the Czech landscape and address the climate crisis is insufficient, the speakers have called for a more brazen approach.
The last drop was attended by representatives of major organizations such as the Duha, Greenpeace or Greenpeace movement, as well as smaller local associations.
"There are, for example, people here who have performed long-term anti-proliferation at the bottom of Turů, there are people who are playing against the mining of gravel in the Uherske Ostrah, there are people who are playing against the construction of nonsense dams," she said for the organizers of Marika Volfová.
It stated that the main requirements of protestors are the creation of a water retention plan in the landscape, a marked change in agricultural policy and the subsidy system towards promoting sustainable agriculture and the rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of people, not the reckless and devastating business," she said.
On the Lesser Town Square there was a stand with a petition called on representatives of the Czech state to claim a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of Czech soil and landscape.
The present people were equipped with banners with passwords such as "The End of the Creature of Rape" or "Mine of Coal, More Bars".
From southern Moravia, Jan Škoda came from the Association of Water for People protesting against the plan for the mining of gravel sand in Hodonínsk.
"He threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most efficient source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned extraction of gravel sand is located only 500 metres from the wells, and according to the reports, it is certain that the quality of the water will be at risk.
The so-called agro-ecological farmer came from the village of Valeč in Karlovy Vary Vojtěch Veselý.
He drew attention to the hammers of small farms, which are not born for income and profit, and which supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Small agri-environmental farms are able to feed the entire population completely, while on top they will not do such a mess in the form of a rural and environmental environment," he said.
Three people died in the fall of a plane to a house in Germany
Three people died today in the fall of a ultralight plane to an apartment house in West Germany, and two others were injured.
Local rescue forces reported this, according to which two crew members and one resident of the house are likely to be among the dead.
The aircraft crashed on the roof of the building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The lofty apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, then captured the fire.
Firemen have already managed to get the flames under control.
Deputy commander of local firemen Robert Meyboom has reported that both crew members of the plane have apparently died.
The third victim, according to the police, is the woman who lived in the house.
Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) wrote that it was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from her apartment with minor injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which apparently served as a brake during landing.
The police find out it's coming from a crashed plane.
There was room for two on the plane.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The newspaper Rheinische Post, referring to the eyewitnesses, stated that before the crash, the plane crashed with a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, referring to other Witnesses, wrote that the plane had fallen apart in the air before the impact on the ground.

The mistake has already been rectified
On Saturday afternoon, the Czech savings company mistakenly charged some payments with a card twice.
According to Lukáš Kropík, the bank spokesperson could have involved thousands of transactions.

The problems with double billing card payments were saved on Saturday afternoon.
"We updated the system last night ( Saturday) and immediately returned all these double payments to clients.
At this point everything works fine," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank has deducted money from card payments twice does not know the spokesperson of the bank, according to its estimate it was a lower thousands of transactions.
The cause of the savings problem is found.
"It may have been a combination of more factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
By the end of March, she had 4.6 million of them.
The savings company is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the Central and Eastern European banking market.
On Monday, soldiers will present a three-degree emergency system against coronavir.
"They will, according to the power of community dissemination, be at the level of the regions.
We are working on this together with the epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch said in ČT.
It will be called semafor, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavir.
The Minister added that the inclusion of individual regions will still be discussed with epidemiologists.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian region at present would have an orange color and should be approached by Prague.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at regional level because the situation is not uniform," said Vojtěch.
Vodník and Karolínka
When the waterman Jonah and the miller's daughter Karolínka look into each other, they don't have that at all.
Jonah in love defends his father, the redwaterer Hastrbuch, Karolínka has no idea that her dear Jonah is not human.
Good thing there's a Libor cub that will do anything to protect the entire village, especially Karolínka, from the water villain.
What does it say about her insinuating and lying?
Especially if she can turn Carolina against Jonah and prefer him, the valiant Libor.
Soon everyone in the village is clear who is responsible for the drowning of the night pot, the corrupt flour, the fire of the mill and other loins.
The gleaming villagers will have a water hunt, and there will be an inconclusive water curse on Jonah's head.

The majority of the disease is mild, only three percent of the infected must go to the hospital
Either the Czech Republic is spreading a milder form of coronavir, or the summer dose of sun has significantly improved our immunity.
The hospital's infectious wards are half empty, even if the infected numbers are growing.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is given mainly to the number of hospitalized people," confirmed the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth reminding that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, they carried out all the clothes, collected the army, the republic was closed, and the Czechs consumed the disinfectant for the year ahead.
Yet, ten people died a day.
Now the daily increase in the number of infected people is higher, but every day with covid-19, maximum two people die.
The highest number of people infected is still Karvinsko, similar numbers have Jihlava due to an outbreak in the local Alzheimer’s centre, where there are 57 already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors was closed by a hygienist in Černotice, Královéhradeck.
The disease confirmed one of the nurses' tests.
"We are coming, we have reduced movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says Martin Schánel.
According to him, none of the clients at home have any signs of illness yet.
The horizontal testing will begin to be carried out by the hygienists tomorrow and will then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to an increased number of infected.
The Oncological Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people have a dress on their way in.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists who have recorded 25 cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign workers of dusty companies.
In total, 131 infected arrived on Saturday - that is, half of Friday's number - but less tested this weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh wrote a fairy tale, Anderson's gone.
The great surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh demonstrated excellent performance even in the fight with a player who won the second most prestigious company in the framework of the PDC in 2018.
The initial match was double-balanced, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian arrowr.
Van den Bergh took a bottle of 13-shot leg, and he's been on top ever since.
He literally crushed his opponents with his game and made much more experienced "Scotting Scots" hard to get to the pits.
The way in which "The Creator of Dreams" had it in his fist, it also shows that the spoiled Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian was handling excellent high checks.
Last time he lost in the 11th leg, in an unfavorable state, he "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson saw a huge frustration.
He rather threw the arrows away, and he was behind the triumph walking his opponent, starting completely sovereignly.
Van den Bergh changed the first of the three match darts and kept his name - wrote his great dream.
The profit of the trophies named after Phil Taylor is more valuable to the Belgian shooters that it is his first winning major.
Continues to say that the last player who could beat Bergha's van day is Karel Sedláček.
Nantes was charged with a cathedral fire, a man confessed.
The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original glass windows of the 16th century and destroyed the organ.
Suspected of arson, the investigators examined the fire because the fire was progressing through a temple from three different places.
At the same time, the police found no sign of forced entry into the Cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a ninety-year-old Rwanda refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without the prosecution.
Now the D.A. has informed that on the basis of new evidence, a man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and face the charges of arson.
In case he is found guilty, he will be in prison for up to ten years and a high fine.
According to his lawyer, a man regrets the act and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present "semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fulfil the role of a pandemic plan for which the government and the Ministry of Health are facing criticism.
"They will be according to the power of community dissemination," the Minister explained.
He added that the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague, for example, would currently reach a middle, orange grade.
The system is designed as a regional one, because the situation in each region varies significantly, added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with the epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be taken, whether they are the obligation to wear drapes or the organisation of special departments in hospitals.
In order to establish an epidemiological plan on the Prima Party TV, Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called on the Minister of Interior, according to which people should have clear information on what measures might be expected if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized people remains low.
Vojtěch commented on the fact that nothing major is happening at the place to talk about the announcement of an emergency or the resumption of a crisis crew.
In view of the growing number of infections from Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has once again introduced an obligation to wear drapes at internal events of over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these actions will be reduced to 500 people, now the capacity of 1000 people.
The government procedure, when it was not clear until the last moment, what measures will be applied and when they will be announced, has been met by criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main factors should create a sense of certainty and compare the confusion," said Senator Marek Hilsher in the Questions.
The measures can now vary according to region, for example in Prague from Sunday, the obligation to wear clothes and in non-residue medical facilities, i.e. in pharmacy or waiting rooms with a doctor.
The obligation to wear drapes when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies has been introduced since Friday also in the Liberec and Ústí Region.
In Vysočina, Jihlava, it is necessary to wear drapes in internal public spaces, in public transport and in health facilities since 14th July.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures were released in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as in the Central Bohemian Region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech Government has also approved the so-called "Smafor for Europe", which colorly distinguishes the level of disease risk in individual European countries and accordingly also regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For countries with low and medium risk authorities since 15 June, the Czech citizens have not required a negative test for the coronavirus, or instead they do not require quarantine.
These are mandatory when the Czechs return from countries with high risk.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in a low-risk category.
The technology in Benesov is continuing.
Plays at a third capacity, ends at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešov) The technology at Hlaváčkova Lhoty in Benesov is continuing on Sunday night.
He still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to evening estimates, the police remained here after 20:00, the original gross estimates spoke of three hundred, and in the morning they were at 900, said police spokesperson Lucie Novák.
Originally, it was supposed to end on Sunday at noon, and at that time some of the music systems were shut down.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
The music production is still partially ongoing.
We expect that there will be gradually disconnection and disassembly of music systems," Nováková said.
"Policemen continue to closely control the departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test prior to departure," she added.
The event is supervised by dozens of police officers, foreign police, traffic and order police, and there are also dogs with service dogs in the emergency.
"In the course of today, police officers checked 470 people moving at the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of whom sat behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 police drivers tested for the presence of narcotics and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Even 14 traffic violations were dealt with by the police.
At the request of the participants, the police carried out 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of toxic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants had not been reduced, the police would have hit them.
On the TV series Prima Partie the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said.
However, the number of participants decreased below 1000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, nor did the health station or the Ministry of Health ask for it.
On Sunday, Czech TV (ČT) stated that the technopartes had spread to nearby lands whose owners did not agree with the use of technology.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim compensation.
The tech supporters at Hlaváčkova Lhota arrived on Friday night.
Originally on Friday, the police patrolled the meadow in Blažimi, Benesovsko, where the technology was held last year.
Blajim is located approximately 30 kilometres from Hlaváčkova Lhota, where the technicians actually went down.
According to Novak, no one came to Blažimi.
The girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in Železnorudsk.
The year 2010 was brought by the parents to the rescue service base there," said Deníka Regional spokesperson for the medical rescue service Mária Svobodová, who then transferred the child to the hospital in Klatov.
The viper is the only poison snake in the Czech Republic, and it is in Šumava that these animals occur in a higher number, so it is good to be careful for walks.
However, there is no danger from these animals.
The chance that he's gonna viper you is not too high, that he's afraid of normal contact.
And if she's got room for it, she likes to crawl away for a loud sow.
It only attacks if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
It is not a tragedy, of course, that its poison is very effective against small mammals, but it will not kill people.
This can only happen if you have a particularly weakened organism or have an allergy.
The risk is therefore mainly in children, seniors and allergies.
"Man often has a feeling of vomiting after hemorrhage, sweating, has a fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, with weakened individuals and especially allergics, may come to an anaphylactic shock," she described for Deník Miriam Gred from Klatov hospital.
The man threatened to throw the babies out the window.
After the policeman lile the wine and throw the dishes
After 11:00, a task force entered the apartment, and a man was arrested.
The infants immediately took over the health care, the spokesperson Markéta Janowska reported in the press report.
A man didn't want to work with police officers, throw dishes, knives or pour wine out the window after a cop negotiater.
He made threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with his child in his arms.
One day, he even climbed up on the window window siller, where he wrinkled.
The police are still investigating men.
He doesn't want to publish any more information yet.

Sapa Marketplace: Razaia has revealed meat, fish and egg of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition in inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the Assanation Company," said the State Veterinary Administration.
When checking a stand with live fish, it was then found that the seller had no proof of origin and was not registered for sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a health problem in the long term.
Last fall, for example, the vets discovered an illegal grocery store, with nearly half a tonne of unmarked foods without proof of origin.
Most did not detect the date of consumption, some of the products had a life span and were damaged.
In the case of five kilograms of sepia, the expiry date was three years.
In May last year, veterinarians with police officers arrested 80 kilograms of food on the market without proof of origin, including dried fish, olives or frozen ducks, with a part of which was molding.
Putin was on the phone with the Zelensky before the Donbas truce, Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbas, where he is to start paying a new truce from midnight.
Putin, according to the Kremlin statement, criticized, among other things, the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kiev informed that he called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
New peace of arms was agreed on Wednesday evening by Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
The truce is to begin after midnight at night on Monday, to be "complete and general" and to open the way for the fulfilment of other provisions of peace agreements.
Putin, in an interview with Zelenský, said that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to hold local elections contradicts the peace agreement from Minsk and threatens the prospect of settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament decided last week that the forthcoming elections to local representatives will not take place on the territory controlled by the Russian insurgents.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kiev will regain its return under the control of the Ukrainian land of occupied separatists with Russia after providing them with broad autonomy and holding local elections.
The Green Office, according to the Union Agency, stated that both states agreed on the benefit of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbas and on the need to implement further measures to promote peace in this region, such as the demining of areas of combat or the withdrawal of part of units from the front.
Zelenskyj also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, on the occupied Crimean peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped stop the struggle, however, people continue to die on both sides of the front in occasional firefights and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed more than 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for separatists, which Moscow denys.
Zelenskyi made the end of the Donbas war his priority, but there has not been a more substantial breakthrough in the negotiations.
The unexpected champion in the decade is Rykl, the seven-fight reigned Novotná
Defender of the last two titles Doležal did not finish the Saturday programme four hundred, Kopecký did not jump the foundation in the pole on Sunday.
He has long ruled the Latvian representative of Reinis Kregers, who is being prepared in the group coach Josef Karas, but he has resigned after the discussion.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outside MČR so far, this time he was the only decathlete who got across the seven-thousand border.
More medals were won by Vilém Straský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's a shame that the boys weren't here and Kopa didn't start because that would look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, and I appreciate the fact that I took a person 30 inches away.
Then I was pleased by the stick, and I was most disappointed by the disk, there I was below average," he said on the union facebook.
She won the first day of the seven-point fight with more than a hundred-point predominance of Kateřina Cach, even though she was plagued by a wounded ankle on a reflective leg.
In the remote sector, however, it then recorded only 570 cm, with the spear did not pass 40 meters and did not enter the final eight-pointer.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won 241 points in front of Kateřina Dvořáka.
Its main output is distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around 630.
Yesterday, I started to be drawn away, but I'm so glad I didn't feel it at all, and I didn't even think about it," said Novotna on the union facebook.
Bio LPG arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
liquefied petroleum gas (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
In particular, for its substantially lower price compared to petrol or Naphthia, a given significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like gasoline and diesel, it also has its ecologically friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is a whole new one - it first appeared on the European market and the Czech Republic according to the Czech LPG press release arrived a few days ago.
"These days we received the first 15 tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our gas station in a mix with the classic fossil LPG," quotes the Association of Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
Bio LPG, however, cannot be considered as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the Association, it is chemically consistent with the classic oil LPG, which fuels a number of motorists into their cars now.
Therefore, both versions can also be mixed freely.
"The only difference compared to the classic LPG is the method of production," says Mr Ivan Indráček, Chairman of the Association.
This is said to be one of the great advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, as well as the distribution infrastructure, is quite good, for example compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and cane.
In the future they should also be produced targetedly, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. wood waste.
In contrast, the classical oil LPG is partly produced as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly by separation in natural gas production.
The result is therefore 40-70% more environmentally sound from carbon footprint than oil LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
But it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, it is about the greening of fuel production, that is, the so-called "well-to-tank" ( Czechs from source to tank).
One of the largest producers of bio LPG currently belongs to petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan of Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol also examines the possibility of production in its Lithuanian Refinery.
According to estimates of the Czech Association, some 170 000 vehicles ride LPG; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher number in NAP, approximately 200,000.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 modifications to LPG were carried out in the last year alone.
The LPG is available in the Czech Republic at approximately 950 stations of different operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, number dropped by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for YES) ordered the Ministry to revise the number of coronavirus infected.
New statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The afternoon number dropped from Saturday 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 less infected.
Currently there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"In the wake of a jump-up increase in the number of cured persons, a revision of data which has not been able to update recently," said the chief of medical statistics Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people were infected with coronavir in the Czech Republic, 11,419 were healed and 371 Covid-19 diseases were unfortunately fallen.
Mobile electoral units or correspondence.
Politologist and sociologist were looking for variants for the period of pandemic
In order for people in quarantine to vote in October and senate elections for corontavirus, according to the Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Jan Hamák (ČSSD), there is a need for a change of law.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He said it was Sunday on Prima's TV.
On Tuesday, the Ministry wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of the parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to change the electoral law," Hamáček said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the Government to find solutions under the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister stated that there would be a need to adjust the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine due to health cannot vote.
The prohibition of choice should be maintained for example in open tuberculosis patients.
Daniel Prokop stated on the OVM that the possibility of correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current draft law, which is in the Chamber, then counts on its implementation for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
Prokop also considers the concerns of NO or ČSSD (because it would rather record other types of parties according to experience abroad) of correspondence election overvalued.
Personally, it is against the possibility of an electronic vote, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now it is necessary to develop ad hoc mechanisms (choices) that could be implemented this year and with the least possible health risk.
It considers it essential to be prepared for 2021 when parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
The correspondence option (although in foreign or Czech Republic only) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
They also see the abovementioned electoral units or, perhaps, the possibility of a replacement vote within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how to do so - the choices at the time of the coronavirus - were addressed in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus disease, various types of elections in 67 countries have been postponed this year.
protests in Bucharest: Pig ears were thrown by demonstrators on the government building
The participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Borisov and his cabinet put pig ears on the building of the government.
It was another series of protests against the "Mafiano style of governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a national blockade on Wednesday, said DPA.
Today's protest, which has already taken place on the 18th day after, has, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Svoboda, a weaker participation than the previous one.
About 300 people gathered at 20:00, some of the streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrators in front of the government building played a theatre scene in which they symbolically closed Prime Minister Boris's prison cell and Attorney General Ivan Gešev in connection with the arrest of two advisers of President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both belong to the basic requirements of protesters.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health reform and the end of corruption in the construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of protests Nikolai Hadjigenov said today on public radio that on Wednesday the summit of escalation in the form of "national manifestations in Sofia and blockades throughout the country" is about to take place.
He repeated the demand for Boris and his government to withdraw, as well as for early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov had already told us that he was not going to resign.
It justified, inter alia, the need to implement Bulgaria’s pandemics of Covid-19 and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, although he did not calm down the protestor's retreat.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov's government held a parliamentary vote on trust in Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovič no longer wants to fight without the audience
Coach of football players Bolonia Mihajlovič has had enough matches of the Italian league without the viewers.
The Serbian coach hopes that since the new season, fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're doing right now is not football.
I'm fed up with games without the audience.
It's sex-free football, it doesn't bring me emotions, it doesn't bring me joy.
The fights are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible, and I think I'm not the only one who thinks it," said Mujalovich before the game against Lecca tonight.
The coronavirus pauses follow the Serie A matches in a fast sequence, and even though they play until evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play in terrible heat every three days.
In such circumstances, they don't even know how the teams are.
This season is about to end.
These measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that fans will be back from September," said the coach who had led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovych, this season is extraordinary even because four months were missing on the bench due to the treatment of leukaemia.
"In spite of my illness, the league break, and everything else, our team managed to move on to a level higher.
We want to keep growing, and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of cyber attacks by foreign states, claims Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear installations, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and enterprises.
Some Iranian agents said that this month's fire that broke through the underground nuclear operation in Natanz could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
The spokesperson of Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Abas Musaví told journalists according to the Iranian media that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic daily faces "thousand cyber attacks".
He added that it was not a new phenomenon and that most of them could be reflected.
In recent months, according to Musaví, several wider cyber attacks have been recorded, followed by analyses by "specific governments and groups".
However, he did not communicate any more details of possible perpetrators according to Reuters.
Musaví also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
This month, the article of the Iranian State Agency IRNA discussed the possibility that the enemies of Iran, like Israel and the United States, could be seen as recent incidents.
However, neither of these countries was charged directly with specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States interrupted diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students attacked the American embassy in Tehran and held 444 days as hostages of 52 Americans.
The long-term relations between the two countries increased in 2018 after Washington resigned from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and introduced sanctions against Iran that have a hard impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the U.S. Army killed Iranian general Kasem Solejmani and a member of the leading Iraqi militia Abu Mahdi Muhandis.
Iran then fired on January 8 at the base of Iraq, where Americans operate, the amount of missiles.
The U.S., as far as I'm concerned, admitted that dozens of American soldiers were injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its main enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA car has extended its production time, now until 25 May
Cologne's car manufacturer Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) again extended the production break due to coronavir.
Production lines should restart on Monday 25 May in the morning.
The event will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said spokesperson Tomáš Paroubek.
Production is due to the coronavir pandemic since the evening of March 18.
Originally, the company intended to restore it on Monday, May 18th.
The reason for the extension of the break is, according to Paroubek, closed the border and closed the dealership, so cars have no one to sell.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the start, two shifts.
Coronavir is affected by key company markets such as Italy, Great Britain or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (A Change for Kolín) said that a time-out at TPCA was not signed for life in the city.
"From the beginning, it was empty in the city.
But the streets are gradually filling, especially now, since Monday, when things got very loose.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with the foreign workers who stayed at the hostel.
"We didn't have to solve a problem in two months," said Kaspar.
For example, the youngboleslav Škoda Auto, which also interrupted production due to the coronavirus crisis, restored it on Monday, April 27, in all three of its manufacturing plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants operate at 100 percent of their capacity.
The renewal of production in Scotland was accompanied by more than 80 sanitary measures.
On the night from Monday to Tuesday, in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiná, for the first time after the re-production, the night shift took place.
TPCA currently employs approximately 2500 people and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic as well as the employer in Kolínsko.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to her family
For more than two years, she fought with the cancer of Gemma Sisson, and when it seemed that cancer had been defeated, the disease had come back again.
A ninety - year - old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a hospital bed where she had enough to take her life's love.
Unfortunately, the disease has fallen.
A few hours after he died, a shocking message appeared on her social networking account for the closest.
Gemma Sisson, originating in English Leeds, loved bodybuilding.
With a friend named Ricky Moore who lived with her for more than 16 years, they traveled through competitions all over the world.
A ninety - year - old woman used to play sports and live healthyly, yet in April 2018 cancer was diagnosed.
Gemma started exhausting therapy, radiation therapy, hoping to recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma seemed to have won the cancer, but in August 2019 the cancer returned and this time she attacked the spine.
A culturist and personal trainer, according to the British daily Daily Mirror, has undergone a 10-hour surgery of the spine and has subsequently started a drastic treatment again.
Of course, everything was futile.
At the beginning of this year, on her 39th birthday, the doctors told her that she had a few months to live.
In April, a handsome blonde finally decided to enter a hospital in Leeds, where her family visited her, who even had a wedding with her love Ricky.
Marriage lasted two months.
Ricky last took Gemma on their two-month anniversary at the restaurant.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, a contribution appeared on her social network account that Gema wrote for her family.
"If this has been published, it means that I have finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart that I leave my loved ones here, I will be so happy to get rid of what this terrible illness has caused me.
I cannot thank Ricky, who has been by my side all the time and has given me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network, saying that the pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on the social network," she wrote, saying that everyone should appreciate their lives and live it fully.
Automats for art sell sweat dating, amulet of mushrooms and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, the passing handkerchief will receive the work of most beginning Czech artists.
Pictures and other works are created directly for artmats, so they know in advance that they have to fit to the size of 8.5 inches.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curator's text about the artist and then the work itself," said the curator of the Petra Widžová project.
Artmat works with the principle of coincidence.
Thus, the buyer may be surprised at what kind of art he will get.
It may now become the new owner of the fantastic illustrations of Alexandra Konsplová or mini-views from Teresa Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23, in cooperation with Dora Dutková, prepared a pexeso associated with the Prague walk.
Cards need to be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliana Chom sell pocket packages of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from a bold and fortunecard, a second series of illustrations based on her Spiritist comic.
Health salaries next year will increase by a maximum of five percent.
The bigger increase, according to Vojtěch, is unrealistic.
Salaries in Health could increase by up to five percent next year, said the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for YES) in Václav Moravka's questions on Czech Television.
The professional requirement for an increase of up to 15 percent considers it unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficiency in providing protection aids.
According to him, the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (pays) can be somewhere up to five percent," the Minister said.
According to him it is necessary to reflect on the current situation in which it has hit the choice of the coronavir insurance pandemic and the government's anti-proliferation regulation since March.
The income of the insurance companies fell at that time.
"A 15 percent increase will come to me at this point unrealistic," said Vojtěch.
The average monthly income of a doctor in acute bed care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, sisters 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the pay of the nurse in state hospitals and the wages of the other founders will be up to CZK 7 000.
The data of the UZIS also show that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was in 2019 according to data of the Czech Statistical Office 34 125 CZK.
The representatives of the trade union already stated in June that for 2021 they would require a minimum increase of 10 per cent, ideally 15 per cent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals that must follow the pay tables and the contract wages in hospitals, regions or private.
They therefore also require that the payroll tables be uniform for health care professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will be as much as seven thousand crowns a month.
But for doctors, for example, wages grew faster than wages last year.
According to President Roman Šmukler, the Czech dental chamber should be able to see how the trade unions feel about the state at present.
The House recently approved an increase in the government budget deficit to record CZK 500 billion due to the effects of the Covid epidemic, of which CZK 1.75 billion is to be paid by health professionals in hospitals and social services.
The Council of Health care Providers, according to Šmukler, disagrees with the increase of salaries in the next year.
According to him, hospital and health care institutions themselves should be able to decide the remuneration and, in addition, the money should go to them through a payment decree.
Vojtěch also stated that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
President of the State Reserve Administration (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have one health aid.
He's waiting to complete the selection procedure.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficiency and also buy from Czech companies.
A shivering smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they're calling.
"Smart quarantine works, is something to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss tonight with the army about that evening.
The army works perfectly, and it is questionable whether they should not manage the whole thing again," said the Prime Minister on Sunday on his facebook show Hey people.
According to him, IT systems and sanitary stations cannot be sufficiently connected, which must gradually move on to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where they are one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek for the CTK stated that there is no information on the Sunday negotiations and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step, according to him.
The Smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, a clever quarantine was led by a ninety-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body of the government, led by former Deputy Minister Roman Prymula.
The vibration project was criticised on Sunday by the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
He also claimed that the army might remand him.
Weaknesses in the project have previously been accepted by the government's IT and digitisation officer Vladimír Dzurilla, who is responsible for him.
"The system is working, but it's still working on it.
It's occurred on its own and unsystematic for 20 years, and now we're trying to unify it in a few months.
It's not a jet.
People on the march, the poor hygiene on the march adapt the new systems, and they're actually picking up the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava's Mayor Macura won't run again, because he doesn't want to "stupid in politics"
The current Ostrava Mayor Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason for this is the attempt to "stupid in politics," said Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the Bureau of the ANO movement, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the lead candidate for the NO movement in Ostrava received almost a third of the votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I'd hold on to a term of office, and with my business experience, I could turn everything around and get on my feet," he said to the Respekt.
He added that during the second parliamentary term, he had to some extent been persuaded.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics," added Macura, who, in an interview, called himself a heavy introvert who doesn't fit frequent human contact.
According to the Respekt, it has been speculative for a long time about Macuro's possible ending in the NO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has criticised the ANO movement several times, for example, for an alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few personalities, YES supported the elections of Zeman's opposing candidate Jiří Drahosh.
Macura does not plan to leave the movement YES, which entered in 2017.
"As long as I feel like I can change things in the movement, it's not a total waste of fighting, and that no one is going to mess with me, I have no immediate motive," he said to the Respekt.
He graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming the Mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura acted as, among other things, the director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat in the bodies of other companies.
Uber, offering transport services, will return to Brno
Uber will return to Brno at the end of July, which offers transport services.
This is the consequence of the amendment of the law, he said in the press release of Councillor Brno for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
Against Uber in Brno, taxi drivers protested, pointing out that Uber did not meet conditions such as a name as a taxi or a taxameter.
However, with the amendment of the law, the conditions for operating normal taxis and alternative taxis have changed since July.
Kratochvíl has held several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year with its services.
This step is the result of a change in the law which allows this company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
He was tested by taxi drivers for non-marking vehicles as a taxi or a missing cabameter.
The Court of First Instance imposed a preliminary measure which prohibited Uber from riding in the city.
Brno originally supported the taxi driver, but Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) stated that the city would want to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later decisions of the courts, Uber could ride in Brno, but the company did not use it.
He will now return on the basis of a change of law.
From July it is true that in addition to classic taxis, a light and a taxameter can be used more easily to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too big a party in Brno: flying chairs hit a foot from a man on the pavement
From the fourth floor of the apartment, an office chair flew out of Brno on Saturday night and fell about a meter from the sidewalk.
He was followed by a walker who called the officers immediately.
The patrol immediately upon arrival at the address in the western part of the city noticed an open window under which there was still a chair and several cans and buttocks next to it.
"The noise that came from the room on the fourth floor suggested that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The officers went up the hall to the apartment and asked three young men from age 26 to 29 for an explanation," spokesperson Jakub Ghana.
Rafaje’s appeal request will be discussed by Babiš and ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) is planning to discuss on Monday with the coalition Social Democrats the request to remove the appeal of the Head of the Antimonopolitan Office (UOHS) by Petr Rafaje.
The non-profit organisations have called on Rafaje to refer to the anti-corruption council of the government as well as the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats state that the exchange at the head of the Bureau is in place.
According to information from the Czech Republic, Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term of office ends in the middle of next year, according to the law, he cannot be appointed for the third time.
His appeal is in the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the invitation of non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústecké Region.
Among other things, Rafai's case is due.
Last week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he and the government parties will take a "some opinion".
He also stated that the challenges had not yet been dealt with by the President, the meeting had not yet been negotiated.
According to the UOHS, there is no reason to appeal because Rafai was not accused of anything.
The servers of IHEND.cz and Update.cz have written in the last week that police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with the captain Jiří Čunk.
The meetings brought together, among other things, the decision to compete for the project of a controversial new Zlin hospital for eight billion, which Chinek is hard to promote.
He admitted to the meeting, according to him, they dealt with his "senary activities".
Rafai is similar.
The deputy office of the Ústí Region called on the government to appeal at the end of June.
He also asks for reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision-making of the ÚOHS regarding public procurement according to the Deputy Director for the transport of Jaroslav Koměna is not transparent and has signs of arbitraryity.
Last March, the police interfered with an antimonopolitan office for a tender toll.
This year in June, the server Update.cz pointed out that Rafaj was using flats written on the company of the influential backstage player ČSSD Alexander Chuba.
The $3.5 million deposit on the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafai has been President of the Competition Office since 9 July 2009, for the second term of office the President of the former Social Democracy Member appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year mandate expires.
The Antitrust Act states that the President may withdraw the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it does not perform a post for more than six months or seriously distorts the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
Employees collapsed in the Blanen library with heat.
Air Conditioning Helps
The new technology will cost 740 000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
Three children and I go to a library in central Blanska regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was impossible to stand there.
It was terrible heat and bad air.
Winding didn't help.
Therefore, I am happy for the air conditioning," said Petr Novotný, one of Blanen's readers.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Propa's temperatures were often more than thirty degrees high in the building.
The southern wall of the building is glassy and in sunny days works as a greenhouse.
"The sun rests much of the day thanks to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem for the individual department to vent, because it has to be closed for security reasons overnight.
We often have this way from morning in the library to thirty degrees," Propa said.
The study room and reading room on the third floor were the worst of it.
And the floor above the exhibition room and the principal.
The climate was also unpleasant in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes it happened that the librarians were collapsing at work and ending up in incompetence.
The problem was also regularly encountered in the cultural room in lectures that are attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe there," said Propa.
Originally, representatives of the city wanted to do air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there'll only be three circuits of five.
"The air conditioning will only have the most troublesome spaces for limited funding.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
In addition, the cultural room and the children's department have been informed by Jiří Svoboda from the Blane investment department.
He added that in the first phase, workers installed air-conditioning in the above-mentioned space last fall and modified the wiring.
Approximately 360 thousand crowns.
Blansko City Library has nearly 3,000 registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.

Crawford is back in the game
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it's a NHL player who keeps quiet about his health like a grave and doesn't publish anything at all.
As one of the few, he stepped out of the Crawford series.
A 35 - year - old native from Montréal was only present at the first training session, and he's been missing the lineup ever since.
"I would like to announce to you all that I have been positively tested for Covid-19 and that is why I have spent the last 14 days in my house closed," he revealed the reason for my absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into the full load.
"It's amazing I'm back.
I will do everything I can to get into shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goalkeeper has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goalstore is already the tenth season in a row.
Blackhawks is waiting first for the preparatory duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in front of them.
Thousands protested against the Prime Minister in Israel
Thousands of Israelis in several places protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tackles the coronavirus crisis.
Manifestation took place in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near its official residence or park in Tel Aviv.
The protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants demand the resignation of Netanjahua because of a process in which they are accused of corruption and fraud, and also because the government is addressing another wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," wrote one of the protesters, according to the agency, to his transparency, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known nickname.
"They all see that the emperor lost his dress," he said.
Netanjahu is the first Prime Minister of Israel in office.
He's being charged with three counts of corruption, fraud, and abuse of trust.
All charges are rejected and called witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial can last up to three years, called up by over 300 Witnesses.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was confirmed in Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, with nearly 60,500 people.
455 people died from the disease.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March to help reduce the daily increase of infected people.
However, after the gradual release of restrictions from the end of April, the number of infected people started to grow significantly again at the end of June.
Netanjahu's critics argue that the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, the traders affected by quarantine measures.
The protestors also object to the fact that the government issues conflicting instructions as part of the fight against coronavirus.
The driver broke the car into a tree and died.
The body must have cut out the firemen from the wreckage
Tragic accident happened around 23 o'clock near Nevkovov in a narrow district leading from the Slapské dam.
The driver flew in probably at a low speed down into the woods and broke the car into a tree.
He died at the scene.
The body must have removed the firemen from the wreckage, including cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the crash are checked by the police.
They ordered an autopsy that should explain, among other things, whether a man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and sparing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is involved in a major change in strategy.
They cancel discounts and don't want to cough up one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest environmental polluters is not new.
In the incinerators and landfills, billions of clothes end each year.
A look at a slow fashion, often despised approach to clothing, but has changed quite rapidly over the last few years.
Approximately half of Pietro Filipi's goods sold at full price.
The other half that was sold through the discounts is not going to be able to buy it.
At the end of each season, the company does not want to smoke one collection after another and at the end of each season, to lower the products below their production price.
In addition, according to the owner, Michal Mikka is away from the times of new and old collections and blind following fast changing fashion trends.
"Most sellers count on discounts when buying goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
It is actually a bit of a scam," says the owner Pietro Filipi Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We place an emphasis on making a large part of our collection formed by the so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and timeless.
The segment of premium brands worldwide is typical of any discount, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and thus does not need it," adds Mička.
The giant graffiti represents the RAF of Kurt Taussiga
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The project liked the city management," said Vacek, who completed his work after 14 days of intensive creation.
He used approximately 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp where he was held for weeks because of his Jewish origin.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton’s organization, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig moved to Great Britain, where he voluntarily entered the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then underwent pilot training in Africa's South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the velvet revolution several times visited the Czech Republic and the native Teplice, which gave him honorary citizenship.
Sixty-year-old Kamil Vacek, who has been working in the street graphic art business for over 20 years under the name Camo.
With graffiti he began on the surfaces, which for these purposes was divided by Mayor Jaroslav Kuber (ODS).
Storm Hanna arrived at the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on Saturday afternoon of local time (before midnight SELČ at night for today) on the southwestern coast of the U.S. state of Texas.
It hit the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometres north of Port Mansfield, and in its movement over the mainland it was weak in a tropical storm.
Yet, according to meteorologists, it poses great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong winds and intense precipitations; electrical failures and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported, according to the AP Agency.
On Saturday, Texas’s Governor Greg Abbott declared a natural disaster for 32 counties in southwestern Texas and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning has been received by people from the coastal zone between Port Mansfield and the Gulf of Mesquite Bay, but it has a total impact on the territory of nearly 500 kilometers long before it gradually moves over north-eastern Mexico.
"Though Hanna is now a tropical storm, they can strong rain and wind, rising levels, a dangerous storm and a unique tornado represent a threat," warned the American National Centre for Hurricanes (NHC).
This morning, the local time (SELČ afternoon) was moving in the area of the American-Mexico border and accompanied by a wind at a speed of 85 kilometres per hour.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year in the Atlantic region.
Over the Gulf of Mexico it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometres per hour, but it gradually decreased to 112 kilometers per hour in the course of the land process, leaving Hanna from the category of hurricanes again.
Local authorities have called on storms to survive at home and not forget the hygiene measures involved in preventing the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is one of those U.S. states that most affected by Covid-19 disease pandemics.
In view of the existing security measures and the need to comply with the distances, they are also a big challenge and possible evacuation.
The temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Hidalgo district of Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as shelter after evacuated, who had a positive test for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have called on all evacuated people to take their clothes and disinfectant gels with them, if possible.
"We don't even have it yet.
We are expecting catastrophic floods," said AP Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Predictions say that in some places, up to 300 millimetres of precipitation could rain in a few hours, in some cases nearly 500 millimetres, which, together with rising sea levels, could flood a number of settlements on the coast.
Zeman will lend General's rank to Colonel Lipkov.
President Miloš Zeman will lend general position to Colonel Pavel Lipk on Wednesday.
It comes from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for lending the rank of Brigadier General is the August ascension of Lipka at the post of representative of the commander Allied multinational division of the North-East in Poland.
Lipka has been acting as a representative of the Czech army's ground forces.
The promotion of Zeman at the end of June was proposed by the government.
Since the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karl Řehek to the position of Deputy Commander of the Multinational North-East Division in Elblag, Poland, who is in charge of allied presence in the territory of Poland and Pobaltí.
Řehka became Director of the National Cyber and Information Security Office (NÚKIB) in March.
The government has suggested to the President that Lipek lend the rank of Brigadier General.
According to the Law on the Military of Occupations, a higher rank may be lent to a soldier for the duration of the elected function or for the duration of the service task which requires a higher rank.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division corresponds to the general rank.
The soldier to whom the rank has been lent has the same rights and obligations as if he were appointed to this rank.
However, it is not entitled to adjust a salary corresponding to that value.
Lending the rank continues to ignore the reason why it was granted to him.
"The Colonel Lipka shows high professional preparedness and is a role model for subordinates.
In a significant way, he participates in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and the security of military participation in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence stated in June on a proposal for promotion.
The Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 p.m. at the Prague Castle, attended by the Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavir standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for aircraft travel to help reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer announced it.
The agreed standards include compliance with the distance or wearing of the drapes in both the aircraft and the airport, but the central seats on the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
Reuters reported it.
"I am glad that my colleagues have adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," said Scheuer at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement was concluded by officials and that ministers had yet to formally approve it.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from six years old, to comply with the recommended distance during security checks and airport check.
Enough fresh air must also be guaranteed on aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
Aerolinks will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules on which the officials agreed meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards caused confusion.
At the Arctic Spicbers, a temperature record fell, measured almost 22 degrees.
"The 41-year-old record fell in Longyearbyen," said the Norwegian meteorological institute on Twitter.
In the evening the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Fahrenheit, exceeding 0.4 degrees the 1979 record, he added.
Around two-thousand-thousand Longyearbyen is the largest town in Špicberky, located about 1300 kilometres from the northern pole.
Spicbers are warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers of warming other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, as stated in the Norwegian Centre for Climate Study report last year.
The average temperature in the Spicbers, according to him, has increased by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100 it can rise by even ten degrees if it does not reduce the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Temperature growth can result in the permanent freezing of land on the Špicberks, which will jeopardise the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seales, that are dependent on the ocean's ice blankets.
The two-week quarantine awaits the return of Spain
The British cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all roads to land Spain that are not necessary because of the risk of spreading Covid-19 disease.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people must be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules shall enter into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have adopted this decision to prevent possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomacy stated in its statement.
"We have always made it clear that if it is necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe ones," she added.
As the British Metro newspaper noted, the latest announcement will strike the travel plans of thousands of British people.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British are concerned, among other things, whether they will be paid out sick if they will have to end up in isolation after returning from their holiday for 14 days.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne ordered a 10-day vacation at Lanzarote, leaving on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go all family, my wife Amanda and Bethany's daughter, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what was going to happen.
I work as a driver, and I don't think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks on my return from my vacation," he quoted Metro Hunter.
In relation to Spain, there is concern that the country is at the start of the second wave of the epidemic.
In the last two days, over 900 newly infected people have always arrived there in 24 hours.
The authorities in some areas are already tightening the coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia, trying to limit all nightlife and preventing people from meeting in the great.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently pointed out the increased risk of disease in Catalonia, Aragonia, Basque and Madrid.
The Dukovan electricity purchase model will be discussed by the government
The government will discuss on Monday the model of electricity purchase from the planned new block of Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The draft law assumes that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case where the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Force electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for YES) and CEZ Energy Company have previously stated that it is more likely that people will save energy due to the construction of electricity.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as has been demonstrated by developments in the past several times.
The focus has already been criticised by environmental organisations.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of the application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact is distributed among customers according to the size of the fuse - at a lower consumption or electricity consumption - in the case of higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) stated on the material.
Havlíček stated in May that it would assume that the wholesale price of electricity would grow and that people would make money on the construction of Dukovan.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns per year for the family, which he believes is far less than people pay each year in invoices for electricity to support the so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatthrin (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any draft amount, to be contained only in the redemption contract.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, on which traders are now most stocked, is currently around €45 (about CZK 1190) per MWh.
"In contrast with the purchase price and market price of power electricity of EUR 10, the average household balance with a consumption of 3,3 MWh per year - can correspond to four-member households, normally equipped with electrical appliances, including electric hobs and ovens, which do not use electricity for heating and heating of hot water - less than CZK 100/year," wrote the MIT government.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavir pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a purely speculative issue," said the Executive Director of the Energy Financial Group, Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law assumes that the purchase would be carried out by the MIT, or by its authorised legal person owned by the State, at a pre-defined price.
The agreement between the investor and the State guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, including the repeated one, but not more than until the end of the operation of the low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines as an electricity plant with a nuclear reactor connected to an electrical system with a minimum power capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukvanian block should have a power output of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity annually, which would correspond to the ten-hour expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The financing model for the new Danish bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The construction site should be financed in a cost-effective manner, with a interest of 2% for operation.
The financing model disagrees with the opposition, it also bothers the possibility of Dukovany building Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should take part in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by CEZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
CEZ general manager Daniel Beneš, in May, said that the expected amount for building the block at current prices is approximately EUR 6 billion (approximately CZK 162 billion).
Contracts between the state and CEZ on the construction of a new Dunk block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has downloaded material on supporting tourism in the media for two billion dollars.
The material planned by the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) to spend two billion crowns on the internet and billboards on holiday advertising in the Czech Republic, was withdrawn from the commentary procedure.
Minister of State Klára Dostálová (for YES) server ListaNews.cz said that the material is still working on.
The document in eKlepa (Electronic Library of the Legislative Process) was pointed out on Friday server Zprava.cz.
The Ministry's plan justified the collapse of tourism due to coronavir.
During the coronavirus crisis, there was a fall in income and media.
The proposal called for criticisms of the opposition and representatives of tourism.
According to the proposal, which is now for viewing the website hlidacstatu.cz, the MMR planned to give money to advertising on television, radio, press, internet, billboards or areas on railway stations through the State Agency for Tourism Support CzechTourism.
The biggest share of money, 700 million crowns, would get television.
Most of them would get Nova and Prima's private television.
Printed dailys and weeklys would receive 400 million, and the same piece would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
The radio stations would get 350 million for the media campaign, most of which are back to private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at stations or subways.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic should start in mid August and last for a year.
"There is still work on the material, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," said Dostálová without further details of the list server.
The material criticized the opposition, according to TOP 09 Market Director, Pekarová Adamová would benefit from the advertising by the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this ludicrous contempt will be given to the fall at the election wound between the eyes," she wrote on Twitter.
She rejects that it is in fact a matter of aid to the affected crisis media.
"It can also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she said on Friday, "N.
According to her, the budget is two billion indicative.
"We're counting on it, of course, it could be less and more.
It's working material," she added.
The initiative to save tourism does not give a media campaign to promote domestic tourism meaning.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not a unnecessary advertising campaign," said the president of the initiative Tomáš Barčík.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, it is an initiative in an open letter to the government.
The broth of life, the rooster of beer and death like a loofah of weed
The third album, called A Death, is the blade of Brno poet's grass, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Friče, who also left a year ago, May 24.
In Frič's discography, it is the fifth item and, like the previous titles, the main focus here is on Frič's poetry, which is itself an excellent artist.
Frič, 1949, was obviously influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was accompanied by his own personal experience and also very niterove expressions of faith.
However, he was far removed from his pursuits by speaking or writing about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, unaggressive, totally tolerant.
I think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček), the masters will apologize.
Frič's album offers recordings of the 2006 author's reading, but also performances with musicians who have always been very sensitive to it, whether it was cellist Josef Key, or Honza Bartoň and Winnerslav Holata.
I would like to help myself - in the words of Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about long poems.
"Salt from them proud and endless bitterness," writes Hruška, "on the state of our world threatened by death.
The world, which is becoming increasingly subdued by the insidious consumption of vanity and counties, is becoming increasingly distant from what his soul was created from - the mystery of faith, humility, and human proximity.
They referred to a stesk of him who knew that the values for whom he was created were of little interest, but who also knew that they could not be destroyed because of general disinterest.
These poems reminded us that a person may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how he loses it.
If he sells himself out to a general failure, he s skeptically resigns, shuts up in fear, or stays in a calm and proud state of what he believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamáček
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid advisor to social democracy.
The President of the Party and the Home Secretary Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
Hamack said it today on the TV series Prima Partie.
Paroubek informed the list server on Friday that he should be Hamáček advisor.cz.
"We'll write a text from time to time, he'll send me some material, and I'll read it," said Hamáček today.
He added that, however, this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the ČSSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"I sometimes read his opinion, so there are a lot of people," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with Ms ODS Jana Černoch, the Minister said that many ODS members are still "discriminately listening to Václav Klaus' views".
He thinks it's okay, because it's an experienced policy and a former party president, which is the case of Paroubek.
The fact that the media are making it an affair, he called it a sign of this season's cucumber season.
Server ListNews.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek played the role of Hamáčkov unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that at the fourth place of the candidate party in the oral region, former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and acted as vice-president of his LEV 21st party.
Hamack said today that the candidate's composition would not comment until it was finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, he's a kick in the ass, he's an old Swedish challenger.
It is the 22-year-old American stick that has the ambition and potential to belong to the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like two years younger to defeat Duplantis, and last year he beat him to the head of the NCAA association.
"We had a battle a year ago, then he won and I was second, then we switched.
In both cases it was a very good duel," describes Nilsen, who won by the performance of 5.95 meters.
But since then Duplantis has fired up and is now alone in the highest poles.
In only 20 years he became a world recordman, this year on 8 February in Torun crossed the bar of 6.17 meters, one week later in Glasgow he added a centimeter.
"He jumped six meters already in 18 years when he graduated from high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletic Web.
"It was clear that once he came from a boy in a man, all his potential and talent would be tenfold.
Twenty years is quite a good age to jump the world record," he thinks.
Although the Nilsen account of success is thinner than the one of Duplantis, an American has similar goals.
In February this year, he improved his personal record to 5.93 m. Last August, he won a gold medal at the Panameric Games in Lima, and in 2017 he made his way to the American World Championship, where he finished 13.
The nearest milestone then for him is the first time to taste the Diamond League.
"Absolutely, it is my priority to get on a professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name for yourself," she realizes.
"If you can succeed on this level, surely you can also lead at events such as Olympic Games, World Cup or Pan-American Games."
However, due to the pandemic, these peak holidays are delayed, which gives Nilsen and the other stickers time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere battle for silver?
"They're all trying to reach him, but I don't think that will be possible soon," Nilsen thinks.
"This kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile ahead of everybody else in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he's gonna want to raise it.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a disability pension of an invincible son.
She's going to have a trial.
The money that a 33-year-old receives from the state as a disability pension is intended primarily to improve the quality of his life.
For embezzlement, a woman for up to eight years is in prison.
Because of his ill health, he removed the judgment of the sick man from his lawfulness and appointed his mother a guardian, who would manage his son’s money, among other things.
"A woman from mid-November 2013 to this January used a part of her son's disability pension funds for her needs and took it out by CZK 440 000," said police spokesperson Dana Ladman, saying, "that the accused woman was affront that she had a particularly imposed obligation to defend the interests of the injured person as a guardian.
A woman, as ordered by the court, set up an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying for the costs associated with the son's stay in a medical facility and paying the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of a vehicle, electrical appliances and the running of a household," she stands in charge.
That he can't use his son's money for his need, the woman confessed.
But she argued by helping out with family expenses.
"We've had trouble keeping our income going home.
We've never bought anything more than standard.
It was always about things that a son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, says scientists have found instruments
Finds from the cave of Chiquihuite in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 instruments from limestone, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat, and pointy objects that could serve as piles of spears or spears.
Scientists found that the oldest of the instruments came from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of the two studies that were published on this topic in the magazine Nature.
The youngest instruments reach 12,500 years of age.
According to experts, the people of the Chiquihuite cave, located at a large altitude, have lived for 20,000 years.
Up to now, the generally recognised theory has talked about the fact that the first representatives of the Homo sapiens have crossed the land bridge from the area of Russia today to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archeological evidence, including unique spears used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this clamp culture has subsequently spread to a large part of North America.
This model, however, has been given a crack in the last decades when several ancient settlements were discovered, two to three thousand years older.
In the second study published in Nature magazine, 42 different sites across North America have been published, showing human presence on the continent from 26 000 to 19 000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people might have come to the North American mainland before it had been assumed.
Some may have made their way to America.
"It is clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovian culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn from Alberta University.
So far, interest in tickets is filled with an optimistic scenario, claims the seller.
Prices decreased gradually too
Flights in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Despite last summer, interest is still about half, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
The development after the crisis thus fills the most optimistic scenarios according to the sellers.
Flights prices are also gradually reduced.
The most sought-after destinations are mainly South European countries, according to sellers.
According to Kiwi.com, they run Spain, Italy and Greece.
At Letuška.cz, flights are sold most to the Croatian Split.
Other countries are then the most sought-after UK, but it was one of the most difficult destinations ever.
The average flight price is also reduced.
At Letuška.cz portal around 6250 kroner was around mid-months, 3000 kroner year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices fall to some European places, such as Spain or Italy, in recent weeks, by about a fifth.
The crisis also influenced the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets with much less than before, as they fear further developments in the coronavir situation.
According to earlier information Kiwi.com, the purchase time of the flight before departure decreased by approximately 10 days a year.
"This confirms the future trend, when people order tickets with much less advance, they will require greater flexibility, less risk," said the vice president for Kiwi.com, Michal Šindelář.
Currently, the average booking time is 21 days before departure.
Together with the growth of sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is increasing.
Regular lines to more than 60 destinations currently operate at Prague airport.
Last year's summer season is about half the destinations.
Big finale tonight!
Follow the arrow battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC has advanced to the grand finale.
It will introduce an experienced 39-year-old Scottish arrowman Gary Anderson and a surprise tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson shut down Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the tablet ranking.
However, he and James Wade did deal with it, and in the quarter-finals, he fought hard with Simon Whitlock, who had sent home a world-class number one.
"Scotting Scots" was almost in semifinal when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last moment he fled the tomb from the shovel, in the extension he dominated and after the result of 18:16 he won a place in the finale of the tournament, which he had already ruled in 2018 when in the awesome battle Mensur Suljovich 21:19.
World Matchplay's greatest surprise is Dimitri van den Bergh.
Belgian talent enjoys the tournament and just maybe knowing that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on a absolutely fantastic wave.
The twenty-six-year-old shooter first surprisingly eliminated Nathan Aspinall's six world-class six, overwhelmed Jo Cullen in a dramatic battle, and, in the quarter-finals, even Adrian Lewis.
The big test was semi-final.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the outset, but in the calm playing Belgians then got a great series of lead, which he then held up to the end more or less.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, putting him at risk of occasional uncertainty on the doubles.
Coronavir cases have occurred at least since the beginning of the week, and the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was discovered in the Czech Republic for the first time, 15 212 people have been infected with it.
Almost 9 600 of them have already been cured, 368 of them have died.
At present, 5,254 people are sick.
It comes from data from the Ministry of Health's website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases in this week exceeded four times two hundred.
The maxim was 281 on Friday.
On Thursday there were a positive 235 tested, day earlier 246 and Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week there were 169 infected.
9 590 people have been cured from Covid-19 in the Czech Republic, i.e. 63 percent of all still infected.
Most of them had a mild disease.
In the hospital, according to recent data from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavir, 19 of whom are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 diseases in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days, in the conversion to 100 000 inhabitants, still reports Karvinia, almost 59.
Followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Mistecko with 36 infected to 100,000 residents in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people in the Czech Republic, new measures against the spread of coronavirus have been applied in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear clothing at internal mass events over 100 people, cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced from the present thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have proved to be infected with the new coronavir has already crossed the limit of 16 million.
It was reported by Johns Hopkins University of America, who's been monitoring the development of the pandemic globally.
The balance of victims who died with the covid-19 disease is approaching 645 000 according to this source.
The latest million infected came into statistics in just three days; the 15 million had fallen on July 22nd.
In recent days, the United States, which have already registered over 4.1 million infected, has the largest proportion of rapid growth cases, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where nearly 1.4 million people have been infected by authorities.
The infected are now increasing at a record rate.
This week, the World Health Organization announced that more than 284,000 new cases were worldwide from Thursday to Friday, which is the highest daily balance since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the top of the human population, such as the US, Brazil or India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases in the past week has grown in nearly 40 countries around the world.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The injunction appeared already in almost all countries of the world, the first case was officially announced by the DPRK today.
The air in households is five times worse than outdoors.
Health harms air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only poor air quality in the outdoors but also at home.
Israel’s health experts Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post, pointed out this.
According to Abraham, who deserved the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, household damage needs to be addressed right now when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the American Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than the outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that 3,8 million people die from bad air quality in their homes each year.
"It is because of the coronavir epidemic, which has made many people work from home, people must spend more hours in their homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of air in their homes," Abraham said.
In Israel, according to her, almost nobody deals with the quality of home air.
It may be dangerous to find things that come into contact with people - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poison gas also produces clothes that we wear regularly into the dry cleaners," Abraham said.
According to her, children, older household members and people with breathing problems are most at risk.
Otherwise, individuals may start suffering from problems such as headaches, fainting, irritability of the nasal tract, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergy.
In long-term exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all harmful substances come from objects within households, the source may also be the material from which the houses are built.
Kvíz about Václav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write the Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost a chance to proceed to the highest football league in Spain because of the coronavirus disease on the team.
The competition was cancelled by the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could arrange for participation in the play off.
Fuenlabrada announced another 12 infected people on Saturday, which led to the total number of positive tests for covid-19 at the club already up to 28.
Due to the disease on the team, a Monday duel against La Coruni was postponed, where Fuenlabrada was enough to get off the game.
The competition's leadership today has indicated that the duel against La Coruni has definitively withdrawn with regard to the higher power due to the fact that it was no longer ever played.
Fuenlabrada made the decision.
On the contrary, La Corunya is not playing the game.
Finally, due to the results of their rivals, it would not be enough to save Fuenlabrada, but it considers it unfair that the last round did not take place according to the practice complete at the same time.
The former elite Spanish club is in danger of falling into the third league by trial.
The first two teams of the Huesca and Cádiz tables have the certainty of the procedure between the elite.
The remaining third step point will be met in the playoffs by Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche.
Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
The daughter of Dominica has revealed it
"Daddy didn't have to do it for many years," she said for Ah! the oldest daughter of Gotta Dominika, with the fact that Master Havel couldn't come to his name and whenever the speech came to him, Karl was always upset.
It's hard to tell what they did, but, according to Dominika, the dispute started sometimes in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in some article after the revolution that he had made it easier than he did.
Havel could have written in his drawer at the time of darkness, but if he had resisted somehow, he was done with his career," says Gott.
He adds, however, that the Czech greats eventually found their way to each other.
"I know that Havel couldn't hear his 60s at all.
But then the president congratulated him on his birthday, and suddenly he changed his relationship with him," recalls Dominika.
In fact, ten years later, Gott even invited a former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel in Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because Father then regularly invited Mr. Havel home in Bertram," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavíka also said that he had never received a State honor from Václav Havel.
However, he was only expected to be in 2009, although he was already his successor in the position of Václav Klaus (79).
Another honour will come to him in memory, the current President Miloš Zeman (75) is to give him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.

The warning of meteorologists against the risk of fires concerns Central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberecký, Ústecké, Karlovy Vary and Plzeňský Region.
Fire warnings will be in force until further notice.
"We don't expect major precipitations that would mitigate the dangers, in the northwest and in the west of Bohemia at least until the end of the week," says the Czech Republic.
The Prague magistrate responded to the weather warnings by prohibiting the distribution of fires at risk sites to be applied from Tuesday.
