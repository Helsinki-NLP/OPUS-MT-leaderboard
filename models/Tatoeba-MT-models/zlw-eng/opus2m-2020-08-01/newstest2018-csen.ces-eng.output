The Civil Rights Movement has issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Privilege of Colorful People (NAACP) has published a warning for colourful people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory principles of the state and racist attacks.
“The NAACP recommendation for the state of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and the people of Missouri to pay increased attention to travel across the state as a result of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents that are currently taking place throughout the state,” states the association.
NAACP stated that this step had been adopted under the current laws of the State of Missouri, which made it difficult to defend racistly motivated acts before the court, as well as the conduct of criminal proceedings which disproportionately aim at minorities.
‘Civil rights violations are in place.
People are being stopped by police because of the color of their skin, they are being assaulted or killed," said Naacp president for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We still have the greatest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind that the organization has issued for the United States.
Among the incidents quoted by the organization were racially motivated abuses directed towards the students of black skin at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black skin from Tennessee.
Sanders died in disputed circumstances at the beginning of this year, after his gas travel across the state ran out, and the police put him in custody without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to the recent declaration by the state's Supreme Government of Missouri, which states that black-hair drivers have a 75% higher chance of stopping them.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared - they should carry money with them for bail or alert their relatives that they are about to travel by the State."
According to current FBI numbers, there were hundreds of hateful behavior cases in Missouri in 2015, reaching the state to 16th place between all countries.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue the company for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after the States have approved immigration law, which allows state actors to retain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which according to ACLU is to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by a chef.
Even after 12 years, her family has no peace!
The murdered is Sally Anne Bowman's model.
A girl from Croydon was murdered by chef Mark Dixie in 2005 at the restaurant where she worked, and he planted stab wounds on her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, and then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched a thorough criminalist work looking at the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to the jail of 34 years for the murder and rape of a model Sally.
In court, he only confessed to assaulting a juvenile, and the lawyer claimed that his client had found a dead girl lying on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting night after night.
The killer said, "He was really angry and after his attack the girl started screaming."
"She drew attention to the cabbies," he said lyingly.
The girl, according to his statement, was supposed to defend herself, however, in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proved a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his hornyness and the taste of a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at his ex-girlfriend's drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, and he said it to the police himself, Dexia.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, which is why he attacked her from behind and put his hand through her mouth," she added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family is facing further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people in freedom who dig up these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," revealed Linda's mother to the Mirror of the deceased girl about the disappearance of the urn with ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are neither prude nor conservative," says Martin Raž, who operates Prague's boutique Intimity.
In it you will find designer and luxurious erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Mareš.
It started out inconclusive, about 12 years ago.
Martin Raž and his friends went on a cycle tour of Moravia.
One of them did not only bring a bicycle, but also a box full of unusually looking vibrators.
"A variety of moles and dolphins, and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with one other partner with the German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which interested Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When his companion left to do other professions, he replaced him.
Today it operates in Benedictské Street in Prague, where it sells erotic aids in the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why wouldn't I?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, do you think?
Oh, come on, don't be such puritans!
Just Berlin's Fun Factory store, designed by respected designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for boutique Intimity.
It was opened in 2010, and it was a completely different concept of erotic business than everyone here is used to.
No covered windows, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exposed more like perfumery.
Martin and his business partner, Zdeňek Šebelka, began to consider how to assume the Prague trade where he should be and what his name should be.
The name Intimity liked both of them.
"It is intimately related, and it is also, you can say, tender," he says.
It followed the purchase of internet domain and the search for a suitable space that went parallelly with various visualizations of the interior.
Finally, the variant that spread the store to the garden of pleasures and bedrooms that the bed generates has won.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from FormFatal.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn't look perfectly perfect because he wasn't on the main street, but he was sitting on the name of Intimity again.
He's intimate.
He's in the alley next to the main one, so no one's in a customer's position," Martin Raž praises.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a store that will be different, with nice branded goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of them for entering such a business at all.
When I was walking into the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the streets of emptiness were gone.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going to the erotic store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from boutiques with fashion.
Even though there's only a woman's service in the store, it doesn't mean women don't dare ask for help, it doesn't mean a man's leg won't come here.
Mostly, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't estimate the right size and choose the greater size," Martin smiles over a lot of mistakes.
Those are the prejudices, the clichés that women need some big help, and that's not true.
So, a man of good faith chooses, for example, an unnecessary big vibrator.
Similarly, men choose mainly black underwear, whereas women tend to be more of a pink colour.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product duly called Satisfyer.
From the look on my face, it must be clear that I don't know which one is beating because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a non-touched clitoris stimulator.
There is an adolescent need for me to be admired at the serious tone of interpretation.
It's as if it wasn't.
And it doesn't actually get used to it.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't believe he'd be so well received.
It's some kind of latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse.
He took care of the fact that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He has completely demolished the taboo that may persist in some men and that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"Differences are being made," he continues.
With one engine, two engines, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
With love, a woman may have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of vibration.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of feeder vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women, it seems, prefer multiple-purpose tools and buy classic vibrators, even though they use it only externally.
But in Western Europe, especially younger customers, it's very popular.
What about the men?
It's hard to tell whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin thinks.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." The most important is the masturbation machine, in this case the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical replication of a vagina, but "you sleep like a shower gel or like an egg or a futuristic object.
He's a lot focused on functionality and experience.
In Japan, it's very different.
It amazes me.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot from erotic aids, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," I'm being explained.
The common one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more related to women's use.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women."To be interesting, what the Japanese brand Tenga, represented in the boutiques, is still selling worldwide, is still about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not prudent.
On the contrary, we are a very helpful nation.
Definitely unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical client of the trade ranges between 35 and 50 years and "has had a certain experience with sexual life as well as with some help.
It will come for something nicer, better to complete a partner's life or for herself." Martin Raž and his business partner Zdenek Shebelka are looking after each product to see if it is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to be involved in bondage and latex specials, because we don't have space for that, but it's not really appropriate.
Things like that could be a distraction to the ones we're trying to target.
Which are the people who have always been proud to go to a sex store because they were afraid that something like that would look at them.
Indeed, a lot of products displayed on the cheeks are kissing.
It is also given the choice of represented brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awarded was the mentioned sea horse "and it triggered a change in the whole sector.
It started to drop off cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with healthless, they began to produce other designs, different colors...
The pleasant thing is that some are behind the design of Czech Republic, a popular designer Anna Marešová.
I must say, I was kind of surprised at how many people here are buying Anna Mareš's design stuff, even though it's relatively expensive.
There are customers who go straight for the Venus marbles from Anna Mareš.
She has done a great deal of work by presenting within the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anne's story started as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to have a manufacturing process under control and I also wanted to know from what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a big job, it's a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a big series.
I may go a little against the current, but I find it important to maintain developments in the Czech Republic.
It might be a good idea that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna later describes to me the situation that agrees with Martin that our society is becoming more and more open.
He does not meet with negative or rebuffing attitudes.
They say that people are embarrassed.
"But you too will start smiling." Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator on which you can get a personal message, and this year he is planning his own lubricating gel.
In the following year, vibrating eggs and more news should be added.
Borders of healthy sex
I wonder where there's a limit to what's right.
Is there anything Martin Raž wouldn't sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What happens to one person is normal, another may seem completely abnormal, so we define ourselves with a range of branded manufacturers.
None of them go into some sort of extreme state.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they had?
Just this week, an e-mail came in, in which some lady demanded a masturbation aid for her friend with a natural length of 20 centimeters.
So we had to write that we didn't have anything like that.
The question is whether anyone's making fun of us," Martin is measuring me with a suspicious look.
Even that happens from time to time...
Morning for Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancer!
His friend Karel Štědrý is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is fighting a disease that will steal people's memories.
"Yes, unfortunately it is true," confirmed the sad information of the singer himself.
I know about my illness, and I'm handling it pretty well, given the circumstances.
"I'm taking medication to slow down the disease," he added, saying, "thanks to the loved ones for their support.
The whole branched family came together to make life easier for Karl.
Eva's wife is trying to be at home as much as she can, with her father in the White Mountain, the daughters from Zuzana and Tereza's first marriage, she's the son of Karel, said Karlas.
He fought cancer twice and gave his experience to Slavík to support him in his difficult treatment.
He's got 60 chemo.
He managed to get back to work after them and the tennis court and ski slopes.
"From an astrologer, I have been foretold to be here by the age of 90," said Karel Lightning.
He's a fighter.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of songs so I don't forget them," admitted Karel.
The same disease is now being fought in the Institute and actress Květa Purpleová.
Do you have a Alzheimer's patient in your family?
Look at how to treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has repealed the prohibition of interference, the law will assess the U.S.
In Chile, there is an absolute ban on artificial discontinuation of pregnancy, therefore it must not be done for health reasons either.
"I am sorry that the legislators filed a complaint to the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have argued about in Parliament for more than two years," Ms Isabel Allende complained.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and at the end of August it should be given a new President, who, according to the AFP, is close to the opposition.
The law that disrupts the absolute prohibition of interference, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on 19 July.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law will invade the court, because it believes it violates the right of an unborn child to live.
Members of the vote on the bill last month until a mixed parliamentary committee examines it.
On Wednesday, the MPs approved the proposal and once again did so by the Senate.
According to the new legislation, there should be no more criminal artificial abortion in three cases: if a woman's life is at risk, if the child has no hope of survival, or if pregnancy has arisen from rape.
There have been similar exceptions under the Spanish letter El País in Chile since 1931, i.e. before women had obtained the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute prohibition of interference in 1989 was introduced by the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the President's office.
Chile is one of the few countries of the world, where an absolute prohibition of interference is applied.
Another are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women in prison who are serving 30 years of prison sentences to break up pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion that the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now the statue of freedom.
An unfamiliar sign of a regime change is a critical statue.
The Americans could tell just as well about it as everyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein's statue on Firdos's Baghdad Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key proponents of Trump's regime, certainly knew what was going on when during the passionate debate with CNN Jim Acosta on the topic of President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set out with a symbolic axe on the Socha of Freedom.
It's nice to say Miller didn't attack a statue like that.
For that, a crowd of ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Freedom would lynch him.
However, he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903, a poster with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the base, up to 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller reproved Acosta in saying: “I do not want to go into history here, but the Sculpture of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light around the world.
A poem that has been placed on the base in addition, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said, this isn't about history.
These are especially the striking words of Emmy Lazarus, which resonate today - they invite not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: “Let him go to me, who drops, who is poor, who can barely breathe freely, who can hardly breathe with a poor worm in the midst of full cities.”
And in modern times, we can better watch these "poor worms" on our screens than ever.
Miller wasn't trying to criticise poetry - he wanted to explain that these people aren't welcome in the United States.
This conflict about the importance of sculpture is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends, who, after her death, sought to set up a poster with poems on the statue stand, knew quite well that they were going into a high political game.
The statue was to express the connection between the French and the US republican government by representing the classic theme, i.e. the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this significance: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but has its own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of exiles.
Merge a poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wing representatives have long tried to reverse this meaning.
A well - known commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana Baptizer argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom was not really inviting anyone to the country, but it represents an early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the fallen world: “The Socha of Freedom is moving forward.
It brings forth the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States."
Limbaugh has a strange impact on the important thing.
The significance of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the point of view of a exhausted and damned passenger, who often, after a long and scary cruise across the ocean, comes with hope in the heart to a new country.
It's literally about looking at the world through the eyes of people looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, a statue of hope is expressed and listens to their needs.
And of course that's a perspective that Miller and Trump certainly don't recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup in Athletics 2017: Neil Black Peeves praise for Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls the time when the British team had only two Scottish members
The head of the Athletic Federation of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, stated that the strong 16 Scots team in the World Championship team would be "a huge asset for the team".
For MS in London 2017, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes has been selected.
Black believes that in Scotland, "there is something special going on" and British athletics could learn from Scotland.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it," Black said.
“I spoke to people from the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
That's what people in the streets think.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“ Few athletes, whether Scottishs or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a feeling of great pride and motivation.
The passion and the unscrupulous feelings Eilidh spoke to were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist Commonwealth, who will compete over obstacles to 400 m at her fifth world championship, stated that she is “unbelievable” that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous 1983 record and 2015 is seven.
In the last year Muirová has only set five British and two European records.
The MS will take part in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another great Scotsman is Chris O'Hare, who will run the track to 1500 m. This season, he won British teams and Annual Games.
Doyle remembers her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The captain of the team led her to "very proud" that not only a large number of her colleagues got on the team, but in many cases they will also attack the finale and the medal.
"The extraordinary thing about the team captain's post is that I was elected by other team members, and it was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was chosen by the team members is a pleasure," she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots that got on the team.
It proves where we moved to.
They're athletes who'll think about the front places on the stage.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did it.
I have only pointed out that we can be proud at this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and enjoy the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race, and I'm gonna enjoy an incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't take care of public function unless you endure the criticism of voters
Our country's father knew of his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave it cold.
But he wasn't trying to shut up the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said: “The freedom of speech may be taken away from us - and the foolish and dumb will be led as sheep to slaughter. ”
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on making him act like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Union for Civil Liberties.
The President’s staff rejected the action as unfounded and many opinions of the type “who cares” appeared in the comments on the Internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolute democratic state, this is an extremely popular republican governor.
He may boast the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not a jerk.
As you can see, the state rules its own rules with certainty and strict respect for principles.
It turned out that it is also skillful to use Facebook as the main means to connect with its voters - the exception is not even the publication of the first photo with the bare head after passing chemotherapy.
The blocking of people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, identified as official and managed by its employees paid for by taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for journal Washington Post Hoganova spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor with the fact that the blocking of comments took place from the position of moderated contributions.
But it's too easy to use an image of Internet trolls, spammakers, or angry people.
Washington Post interviewed several real people to whom contributions were deleted.
And that's what they are - real people who speak to their chosen leaders; teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not detestable.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible, referring to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani's lawyer, Md., asked about hateful crimes, but her comment was not hate.
“I politely noted that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crime and other up-to-date news,” wrote D.C. Post.
"I do not like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same subject, some people are identified as promoting collective efforts rather than being recognised as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's employees call "centred spam interest" would probably call "defence".
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage contributions by blocking criticisms or delete negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets where they would collect and burn all copies of criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public factor to be criticised for dishonoring Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing an action by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born in Virginia last week.
President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment in Alexandria, according to district judge James C. Cacheris, where she prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook pages.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the low price of the mailman had practically the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily press increased fourfold and his position as leader questioned many anonymous writers.
And even in those times, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People who wrote under pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the newspaper and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people in the context of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions critical of his opinion on the Agreement of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain were gathered in his office.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, disapproval and intimidation lie in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept that.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, they consume more data abroad than at home.
In abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the data consumption in the summer season is in Croatia.
On holiday, however, they have more time to browse the web, and under the umbrella they are not allowed to join the Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and a smart phone in your hand.
This is what the typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at home prices.
This results from the fresh statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most of the Czech travelers abroad have more data available within the framework of the paušal than at home.
It is therefore no wonder that in Croatia, where the minimum of ours travels through the winter, data consumption increased even 50 times this summer.
In the second place in the ranking of data consumed, Italy was placed.
The Czechs call from Germany for more than one minute, where many are set out even during the summer.
Croatia according to the data of the Association of Czech Travel Agency visits 800 000 Czechs per year, so it is our most popular holiday destination.
But people here have exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
Record was this July 7th.
"Tens of millions of photographs would be included in the data transmitted," explained the details of the mobile segment director in O2 Silvia Cieslarová.
Although Croatia is leading the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
The first place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is up to 4th and Italy is 6th.
We go to Austria for hiking and active vacations, on which we do not have enough time for paddling on the Internet.
"Moreover Austria, the Czechs are headed for the Adriatic," explained Cieslarová.
While the data was recorded by the operator after the release of the roaming fees of high year-on-year growth, there is much lower growth for telephone calls.
The number of minutes called in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
Germany dominates with a huge lead in front of other countries.
"Roaming calls are used by corporate customers on business trips," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in a homely atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
In the next three days, Ronan Rafferty's former golfer will hope for a relaxing atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th anniversary of the Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on the way to the finals he fell to Paul Eales. This year he will perform the role of ambassador of the tournament in representation of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched Renaissance Club slowly grow up in front of me and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“The players will be able to love a first-class playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a keen advocate of this game and proud of his successes.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
The English Eales will be the first to defend the championship, despite the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour won during his 32-year career.
"I have a good feeling about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I had no chance to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when Sharon and I meant a lot to win for me and my wife.
It was a beautiful time I wouldn't forget."
Gary Orr returns to his home land, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating his 50th anniversary from the region of this year.
This event will be his first participation by Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on the home floor," Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want to succeed and feel a lot of pressure.
I really like to play again, and I think I'm doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far."
The three players will also join former Masters Ian Woosnam champions and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance for the tournament is free. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be devoted to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Land of Indonesia gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, he doesn't use a stove.
In fact, he rarely uses pelvis.
In its wooden hut located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually throws a sweet potato - in the language of local “nota” - directly into the fire.
After half an hour removes the potato and tastes for it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on a muddy land - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing laundry in turbid water from the nearby swamp.
The bucket in the room without the roof is filling up the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late night hours poses a danger: most of the men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. Moreover, soldiers live in the village.
“In the afternoon after 5 p.m. nobody will be allowed to roam around the village,” says Bardina.
It is a rare sight of everyday life at Papua High, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public uplift before the occupied army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakart, which controlled the whole region, except for foreign journalists or civil rights overseers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - an independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a distant and desolated city, where you will get after a 90-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour drive-in stomach.
Mass transportation doesn't work here.
The city with 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of wool plates in shades of grey and rusty colours.
Very few Indonesians, including journalists, and virtually no foreigners, looked at this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, locals worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” says Bardina, pointing to his colorful, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright dress.
"We used to wear leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population live below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in all of Asia.
At the same time, however, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world of Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from the U.S. Phoeenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, home to about 153 000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 Freeport mined gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports wood mining in the estimated value of $78 billion.
However, this wealth is a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
The 2005 New York Times investigation shows that Freeport paid local military agents and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 per officer.
Parrots calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore heavily suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have been raped, tormented, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in Papua Tribal Area during the 1970 ’ s were equivalent to the genocides reported by the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, the 2016 British Archdiocese report, describes the atrocities that occurred last year as extra-judicial executions, torture - according to another report, there is particularly popular rape and electrocution - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrators.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch.
The entire situation has been aggravated by the fact that the Papuan resources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% report to Christianity, but demography changes with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatry and Sulawesi.
The Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants began to sell chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains 40-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Panama and moved to work in the capital of Jayapura Province.
"The original inhabitants of Papua-mama (female) have lost their jobs."
As part of his 2014 presidential campaign, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, named Jok, promised to deal with inequality and rights violations.
The former emperor secured his journey to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But very little has changed in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokpwi with the hope that he would hear our call for justice," said You.
The fact is that only two months after the October inauguration of Jak's experience a lot of shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian motorbike soldiers came out of the sword of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers touched this insult and the tone that she spoke of and later returned with four other soldiers, said the local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the subsidized soldiers chased a group of children and beat them with their arms, made sacrifices and witnesses of events.
One of the soldiers then fired a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so strongly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned down a building near the Electoral Commission, and the following day things were still up.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and the army headquarters and demanded justice.
They came up with ritual hunting bows and performed a wait dance - in which they ran around and imitated the singing of birds - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing stones at buildings.
The command was given to the soldiers through radio: “If the crowd tries at least three times to resist, you have the permission to shoot,” according to the weekly TIME in an official document, the content of which was never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), chief of the Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the dangers and urged the inhabitants to move to their homes.
However, no one had to pay attention to his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," said the weekly TIME on the porch of my petress of a wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people all around, and there was a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was struck three times by his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to see that it was really him," she said, with the sad voice of Yohanes, who uses only one name as many Indonesians.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told journalists that his officers were simply "assuring" a station under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people are threatening to die," said the spokesperson of the Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiya in 2015.
"It is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The murder report asked the likeart media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jok presented a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding for the families of the victims and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
“I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again,” he said.
The Minister of National Security, Wiranto, announced in October 2016, that he would introduce an extra-judicial mechanism to resolve the acts of violence that occurred in the past.
But almost immediately, excuses began to come.
“Most violent acts have taken place long ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task," he said.
However, in the interview of June 5th for the TIME weekly in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he was not planning to take any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be brought before the court. ”
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crime against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand dead during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, stated that 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Pania incident, had been settled so far.
The families of the shooting victims in Panama welcomed his allegations of mistrust.
“I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but I have not yet been able to see anything,” said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
As he says, several years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the sight of many of the people of Panama who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to his words, he was beaten by members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army began looking for me," he said.
And the shooting is still pending.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in neighbouring Deiyai.
The fight where one person died and the other 17 were injured occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in the nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing at the relevant stones and the answers were the warning shooting.
However, locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indian Paramilitarian Police) began to shoot in the crowd and killed one person.
"There was panic, we had a fear of retribution," said the 29-year-old Domininggu Badia, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"I didn't leave the house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has requested the punishment of involved police officers and the withdrawal of mobile brigades from the area.
Madamei was always a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in central highlands.
Many of them joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of rebels who protect the rights of the Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Panama, including not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Komaya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and arbitraryly arrested thousands of people of Panama, all under the pretext of "assuring national sovereignty".
Some of them will never be seen again.
Panai is known among Papuans as "a tragic and forgotten place".
The oil pours poverty into the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is unattainable anyway.
The locals grow their foods: sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each makes four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most harvests are designed for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since the Nabire airport has opened several routes and new immigrants have begun to flow to the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Even so few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
Parrots rarely have the required capital and education so that they can enter business.
"Young people move from villages because of a lack of employment and money," said John Gobai, President of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The isolation is keeping Papua province hidden from the world.
The strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists – Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp – were expelled from Papua, due to the lack of cooperation with the authorities, despite the fact that they have received such a rare permit for filming.
Pelim Kine, Deputy Director of the Human Rights Watch, Jok in his election campaign promised to repeal strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
"For foreign journalists who work in the rebellious eastern areas of Papua and Western Papua, there is a great risk: non-recognition of visas and inclusion in the Black Paper," he said.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesian in Papua is largely limited.
In March, six pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - United Nations Human Rights Council concerning the investigation of various and widespread violent acts in Papua, including the shooting in Panama.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian State Department Arrmanath Nasir lost his charge when he told the journalists in Jakarta that: “The democratic system and the media are still in place in Indonesia, so it is difficult to mask the evidence of human rights violations. ”
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people called according to a source that also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the password "we want freedom".
Another election is scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but the parrots say they won't vote for Joki.
“Jok is a good man, but he is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai,” said Gobau, President of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokov to know that the people of Paniai - except that they live in constant fear of the robbery army - are wreaking in poverty, poor education and health systems.
Gobai claims that the people of Panama, like the other Papuans, regard their voice as a “long ” that needs to be paid to Jok.
"They do not want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the victim's family, the shooting continues in the last symbolic act of resistance: they bury the victims in the property across from the police and the army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least they will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," said Yacobus with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy picked up a huge shipment of cocaine in Australia.
The French Navy has detained 1,46 tons of cocaine worth about 256 million dollars in the Pacific Sea yacht.
The shipment went to Australia.
A four-member ship crew was arrested during the intervention, which is apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and the police dragged her to the port in Nouméa, the capital city of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence reported that in cooperation with its international partners she would seek to determine exactly where they were going and where they were going, and to reveal the 'Litian Syndicate'.
"We are grateful to the French authorities for measures that have stopped a large amount of drugs going to Australia," said her executive director Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street prices.
The country also faces the problem of the growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid isn't the first time.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting a large amount of drugs from the United States to Australia, trying to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean on a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
The problem may be at home for seniors, a solution that according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavela Mádlová could be an infusion of a physiological solution that is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
But they're only applied in medical care for the time being.
The older a person is, the more water falls in his body.
"In addition, the seniors generally accept less fluids and get very quickly dehydrated," Mádlová said.
Two liters should drink for sure.
"But getting so much fluid into an old person is a big problem," she added.
In senior homes, according to her, there is often no doctor watching.
In hospitals, they deal with dehydration via infusions.
"I think that even there should gradually be introduced so that they can get a subcutaneous infusion," she said.
According to her, up to two-litre bottles of physiological solution can be delivered to the old people in a day.
The lack of fluids may cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will manifest itself as a total loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day, the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks confused," he said.
In case of neglect, it may result in brain events.
The blood will get thick and clogged up in the brain, and the kidney will also be at risk.
Lying patients should not be covered with feathers, with a maximum cotton sheet.
The problem can also be disposable diapers.
"It's more difficult for a nurse, but it would be ideal for the patient to sometimes reveal and let the skin blow up," the doctor said.
The Torch was burning in Dubai for the second time
In Dubai, on Friday, one of the world’s largest residential skyscrapers was in flames. Firemen had to evacuate all residents of 337 meters high and 79 floors of building.
In the last two years, this is already the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All the residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries, the cause of the fire is unknown.
"We slept and woke up an alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the people of the skyscrapers.
Dubai's civilian defense said that the firemen managed to get the fire under control around 4:00 A.M. (0:00 GMT) before continuing to cool down the building.
Government officials have added that they provide substitute accommodation for the disabled.
Once again, the incident could create a discussion about the safety of materials used to cover tall buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which initiated the management of the Torch cloud after the fire in 2015, revealed that the lining and external panels used for decoration or insulation were most damaged.
The British police reported that the Grenfell Tower in London could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire during the June fire, where nearly 80 people were killed.
The results of the survey show that more than one of five passengers to the US carry prohibited items on board an aircraft
The survey between passengers has shown that more than 20 percent of them knowingly or unwittingly passed prohibited items through the control post of the U.S. Government Agency Transport Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers boarded the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of the passengers claim to have found out that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
From the results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc., which answered more than 1000 respondents, it appeared that there is more likelihood of a violation of the rules for younger passengers.
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried knowingly to travel with an object prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours of airtight compared to less than 15 percent of members of the X-generation.
The most common items that have escaped the attention of TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents have consciously passed a sharp subject through security, while 2.2 percent of women in question and 3.7 percent of men in question also admitted that they deliberately brought illegal drugs on board the aircraft.
The company stated that it had carried out research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally carried out illegal items through airport control and how much it had done on purpose.
It is no surprise that most people who have carried unauthorized items - whether consciously or unwittingly - travel by plane very often.
As the company stressed, the TSA Directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can pass on to the plane.
It is not surprising, then, that the TSA has confiscated the strictly prohibited fluid in the largest amount.
At some point, people thought that TSA would deal with books in the same way as with smuggled goods.
Liquid transport is permitted during domestic flights, not international.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on the postponement of planned directives to reduce Obama administration emissions
After the Environmental Protection Agency has been sued by 15 states, its boss Scott Pruitt rejected his former decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama Administration plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes in his plan, reacting more savoryly than the previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge against his previous position at the federal appeal court.
This concerns the last deadline, which was set at 1 October, when Member States should start to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "attacks with local decisions or threatening economic growth".
Pruitt, who served as the state-General Prosecutor of Oklahoma for a long time as a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations prior to joining the EPA chief, Donald Trump.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed the regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
A sudden Wednesday turn is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPA enforcer exceeded his authority in order to delay Obama administration's integration plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperation with the States with the help of complex processes and the fulfilment of new standards within a given time frame.
“The previous EPA administration has often failed to meet its deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing with the settlement and further setting of plans,” Pruitt said, who had filed more than a dozen complaints to the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation through judicial disputes and the execution of the deadline is taken seriously.
We never joke about our statutes and the authority that comes from it."
However, the EPA declaration states that Pruitt may use at a certain point "the possibility of delays and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that regulation "will be based on sound policy and the most accessible information".
The Republicans in the congress are pushing for a more extensive formulation of ozone rules.
The budget of the White House approved last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has still not passed through the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneidererman, who was head of the coalition of states that were sued by the EPA this week, said that the group would not be willing to authorise legal pressure.
“In the opinion of the EPA, following our judicial overturn, it is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6,7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution,” said Schneidererman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground ozone occurs when common harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in an atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in vulnerable people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists are having a sudden change in Pruitt with gratitude.
"It is worrying what pressure needs to be made to change the thinking of responsible persons and to protect the air that we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Centre of Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to struggle with the ideological campaign of Trump's administration, which is trying to help pollutors and special interests."
He licked a man with acid, yet he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what's going to happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family and you're laughing, the second one suddenly changes your whole life from scratch.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
Similar fate met Andreas Christopherus from Great Britain, whose face was glued by an unfamiliar attacker who was finally exonerated.
The information was provided by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christopher's.
Andreas picked himself up to open up.
He thought there was probably a courier behind the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for his family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man he's never seen before in his life, right after he opened up without warning, he's been pouring acid with the words, "That's for you, buddy."
The pain was inconclusive.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing, and I felt only unreal skin pain," Andreas said.
The family quickly sent him to the hospital, but there his relatives learned a terrible report - according to the doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would have an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Of the 90 percent were affected by the face that the doctors tried to put together using the skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
A great complication for Christopher has become a loss of eyelashes.
It's probably the most annoying thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today, Christopheros has had 12 operations that are far from the last.
According to plastic surgeons, injuries that suffer from acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have scarred tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight for deformity and disfigration throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesperson of the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that an unknown man must have confused him with someone else.
The perpetrator believed that the revenge of a man who sexually abused his close person.
The police investigated the whole case properly, and then they tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict for the amazement of Christopheros’s family was fundamentally changed.
"Three judges finally concluded that the sentence should be abolished, because a man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
Over the last few years, the number of seizures with corrosive substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior expressed its views on the issue by planning to set new guidelines to state representatives regarding the classification of corrosives.
You should be classified among dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are not going to give up.
They require the Government of Great Britain to impose stricter and longer sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require strict controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different trades, as these are different cleaning agents.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai was burning at night the famous skyscraper The Torch, which belongs to the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to Dubai's civilian defense, the residents of the 80-story building were able to evacuate on time and no one was injured.
According to the spokesperson of the Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
However, according to some of the inhabitants of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with falling hot ruins.
We were asleep.
We got woken up by an alarm, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," the tenant George described the events.
Another one of the CNN's witnesses estimated that the flames engulfed about 40 apartments.
The fire destroyed at least two cars on the ground when they were hit by the burning parts of the building.
About two hours later, according to the civilian defense message, the fire was under control.
The cause of his formation is not yet known.
According to the Witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the power went out.
An extensive fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred flats.
There's about 680 apartments all over the building.
There was no one else at that time, for the inhabitants managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became its 352 metres tallest residential building in the world.
He took another Dubai skyscraper for the record the following year.
The culturist had incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolito had a large collection of illicit agents - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him to the title, finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is in danger of four years of distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year the Italian ragbista Davide Vasta was tested positively for 11 doping substances, which until then was a record amount in the caught athletes.
A third player started taking steroids the year before he fell into bodybuilding, according to his words.
Lucka Vondračková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionate about her ex-lover!
Only Lucka Vondračková has entered the territory of the Czech Republic, in one round.
And he'll also draw attention to wherever he comes from.
The last time she fell into her arms was her former lover Michal Long, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older then, longing for family.
Lucia was only 19 years old then, and she certainly didn't want to hang her career on her nail.
So they went apart, but they remained friends today.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
By chance, they were both in blue.
At first, they didn't notice each other, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes until she fell down.
Then they hugged each other, and they willingly sued the photographers.
However, their encounter was not a coincidence, because they will play a lover couple on the new Prima series Captain Exner.
Islamists have been given life in the UK for the preparation of the assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of the Islamist cell behind bars who called themselves the Three Musketeers and planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army according to the D.A.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and were previously sentenced for similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities then thought he was about to attack immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "belief" in Arabic, and a machine gun.
This happened the moment the MI5 agent placed a listening device in the car.
"The ancient assassinations showed how terrible the defendants could have caused if they were not stopped," said the DA Sue Hemming.
Three convictions at the age of 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
A fourth sentenced 38 years old can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, men claimed to be innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendant's claim.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
They measured 38,3 °C in Hodoninland.
On Tuesday's 37.3 degrees Fahrenheit only stayed on top for two days.
With 38.3 degrees of Celsia recorded in Hodonínska Strážnice, it was overcome by Thursday, which has thus become the warmest day this year.
This was confirmed by the employees of the Czech hydrometheorology Institute.
Unlike Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records to 35 out of 145 weather stations were overcome or levelled for over 30 years.
Only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures on Thursday.
For example, in Strážnice, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice in Břeclavsk, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths and the current 37.1 degree in Pohořelice in Brno exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records came from 2013 as well as Strážnice.
In the west, it was ten degrees down.
The high temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After Strážnice, the biggest heat in Dyákovice was in Znojemsko and Brod nad Dyja in Břeclav, where mercury reached 37.8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the other hand, according to the Czech Republic website, in western and northwest Bohemia, the fourth highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Fahrenheit.
"Temperatures began to grow there later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heats in the Czech Republic will gradually come back and more significant rains may come on Sunday.
Most of the places in Moravia remain high temperatures still on Friday and south-east Moravia on Saturday.
China is missing tourists.
Beijing is losing billions to visa policy.
For decades China has been trying to apply its influence without using force.
He spends $10 billion a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushes his entertainment industry to foreign markets and tries to attract Western tourists.
That's not going well with Beijing.
The state media is talking about making tourism a driving force for economic change and modernisation.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year and about 80 percent of tourists came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, inter alia, to the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome a stranger with open arms, it evaluates the situation in the world's most populated country, the professor of economics from the Beijing University of Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
The example that speaks for everything is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free contacts with China; the citizens of the others have to deal with the visa in advance.
Therefore, the crowds at the Chinese authorities in the USA are comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs 140 dollars, but if you don't want to wait for it long hours in the queue, you have to pay 100 dollars and more for additional services.
Such limitations create significant economic obstacles.
The Journal of Economics and Finance study showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited Land China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and lives there, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when tourism uses its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted transport to South Korea in the spring, as part of a tear around the South Korean anti-racket system, the South Koreans paid her back and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan recorded an increase of 85 percent.
This all affects macroeconomic stability.
According to the recently published US Central Bank report, China could leave up to $190 billion as a result of the Chinese foreign travels, while China will gain about $35 billion annually as part of the currency sales to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a $217 billion deficit in tourism last year, which is 44 percent of the Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
Thus, a small number of tourists in the country, which are anxious to prevent the flow of capital, poses a very painful blow.
However, the above factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places China has practically never heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were less than a million foreigners in all of China.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroad for immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific work shows that immigrants tend to reinvigorate economic growth, business and innovation.
But you will practically not find them in China.
The solution to these problems will be politically difficult, but the step that is offered is the simplification of the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, especially India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and make procedures for the issuance of visas.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Plzeň zoo, replenished deadly reptiles.
The Kingdom of Pilsen, the poison, can enjoy three rare, deadly reptiles.
In the exhibition visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish vipers.
This species lives in North Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 meters.
"He is growing even a meter long," said zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
The children of the other two species, the mortals and the cobras of red, will so far gain strength in the breeding background of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We would hate to lose them," said Nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying that it could take a year or two.
The Australian divinity mortals came to the world eight, they are descendants of a breeding couple from a population in the vicinity of Sydney.
"The only one that visitors can see at the exhibition is that of Pertha's mortals," Vobruba said, saying, "in human care, it is necessary to winter 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Fahrenheit for mortals.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a bunch of African spitting cobras.
A couple in the Plzeň zoo hatched from four eggs in total.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobruba.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to four metres away.
It's aimed at the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The babies of all three species live in the zoo with mouse holates.
Within 40 days in the garden, the cubs from the collection of mamba are still expecting hatching, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an untested transcript of a phone call, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for a border wall.
The American daily Washington Post has published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a phone interview on 27 January with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nete, Trump urged him to stop publicizing that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The American president said that he publicly condemns the building of a wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and said that he would pay Mexico for it.
He also leaked a transcript of his first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tight exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US surveillance agreement for refugees going to Australia was "smuck" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama's reign - he would look "damaged" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the US.
Trump terminated the call after Turnbull explained that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day. ”
Tusk testified again on the procuratory because of Smolensk.
"He has something to fear," said the brother of the dead president to Tusk's address, President of the Government Party Law and Justice PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczynski won't scare me," said Tusk and read to the country's current leadership that he's trying to exploit justice against political opponents.
When he left the D.A.'s headquarters, he waited for Tuska according to TVN 24 crowd that chanted Donald Tusk! and wanted a politician for 100 years!
Tusk thanked for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear, and Kaczyński will not scare me."
According to the prosecutors, there is no doubt that justice is to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against opponents, oppositions or people who do not like, and I am afraid that I am part of this group.
He's been in the interrogation for the second time.
The ex-premier was questioned at the prosecution for the second time, this time he was due to question in the autopsys of the victims of the Smolenian disaster.
In addition, it came to a replacement of the bodies in the coffins.
The families banned opening the coffins, and there had to be some reasons for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal because it would burden the Polish-Russia relations.
"The maintenance of good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have been used to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU," said Kaczyński on Catholic Television Trwam.
He added that the possible conflict with Russia would put Tusk at risk the chance to get the most important chair in the union, which Poland has absolutely nothing of.
Kaczynski also stated that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it might be different with Donald Tusk, but she did not notice.
Tusk has already had an eight-hour interview at the Procuratory on 19 April.
Even then, he didn't speak as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his calls for questioning considered it part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the chief of PiS Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by combining with various scandals.
In Poland, the Prosecutor's Office is subordinated to the Minister of Justice, who acts as the Attorney General.
The call for questioning came suddenly after the election of Tusk to the Head of the European Council, to whom Kaczynski has worked hard to prevent it, among other things when visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone.
In this case, Warsaw left both Viktor Orbán and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the House of Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened up its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It comes from a decree that regulates the delivery of voting tickets to abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared an update, currently in the commentary proceedings.
Four years ago, ten thousand Czech citizens voted for abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justifies its procedure.
"In some countries new representative offices were created, some authorities were closed, or there was a change in the level of representation," says the material.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which are referred to by the representative offices to which the paper voting tickets are supplied.
This group of authorities include the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will get the vote card in the version for the press.
They just changed their list by decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could have voted at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassys are closed today.
The Czech Republic also abolished its representations in the Malaysian Bamaku and Japanese Kyoto.
He won't even vote at the General Consulate in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed the war in 2014 in eastern Ukraine.
Newly, they are on the list of embassys in Nairobi, Senegal, the capital of Dakar and the Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, the Czech Republic has since the last parliamentary elections extended its representations to the general consulate in Iraq Irbíl and Cheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of S'-Čchuan.
Tickets for registered voters will also be available at Czech Embassys in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs in the foreign country had the opportunity to select Members in the electoral rooms at representative offices or consulates so far four times.
Before each election, the constituency panel shall determine the country for which candidates are voted in a foreign capacity.
For the first time in 2002, when it was decided between South Moravian candidates.
In the following two elections, Czechs voted abroad among South Bohemia's candidates.
In 2013 he was chosen the Central Bohemian Region as well.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is increasing steadily.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3800 people came to vote, about 6700 in 2006, four years later 8222.
The early House elections were held at the embassy 10.571 years ago.
The massacre on Moore's Ford: activists remembered racist lynching
From 1948, the Ford Mercury passed past the sightings of Monroe, Georgie, and coderced towards Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four passengers of black skin and a white driver had enough to arrive at the bridge, a group of white men with guns submerged his way.
The group leader - middle-aged man in a striped suit - long pulled from a cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, passengers trembled with fear.
"We want this n--and Roger!" a man shouted.
"Bring it to me!"
Silence breaks the cry of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is a mere reconstruction of the events that occurred on July 22nd.
But when one of the men throws over the noose’s “Roger” neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to Moore's Ford, who are reconstructing the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by Kukluxklan.
No one has been tried for murder yet.
"It is a wonder that in all these years only one person has not been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the event reconstruction.
"It's a spot on our history and burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a life-long warrior for civil rights.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic call for action. Every year, the community of Monroe reminds us that justice was not done enough.
“We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all,” Brooks said.
"Until then, a process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated."
The judge covers on July 27, 1946, one of the bodies of lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI reports of NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were to participate in lynching.
No one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that suspects have been free for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the citizens of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court, the citizens of the black skin of the state of Georgia had the right for the first time to take part in the elections planned for the summer.
And just during the summer elections, according to the FBI, the farmer of black skin Roger Malcom was supposed to stab the owner of Barnett Hester's white skin during the struggle - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, it was traditional that Hester lived with Malcom's wife Dorothy and brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI's statement, on July 25, 1946, the major owner of Loy Harrison's white skin for Malcoma's bail of $600.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
When they returned from the prison, just before they entered Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects took their way.
"As it turned out, he planned the murders and organized Harrison," she excavated the FBI.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between the state and local law enforcement officers, who have not only participated in lynching, but have also removed the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks has made a more brief statement on the whole matter.
"It was a massacre for the electoral right," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the locals of the black skin: "You will fall this way if you register and go to the vote."
The annual reconstruction at Moore's Ford Bridge is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost ten years.
Her performance is illustrative, enticing and ecstatic, showing deeply rooted racism, which many would like to consider in modern America to be extinct.
Following this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult to reverse, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because we must face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us," Greene said.
"But we can't have a relationship unless you hear what I've been through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction started in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors - dozens of white people, the rest of black - got caught up in a room where Greene introduced them with a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is acting as assistant director.
He has played Kukluxlan for many years, but according to his words, the role is exhausting.
“I feel bad about it, because it contradicts who I am,” said Marbaugh.
"I think it's very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time."
Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, also Barnett Hester, are practicing their roles.
The show starts with a fight - Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property."
Rascona can't be done.
There's a fight.
At that moment, everyone (at least every actor in black skin) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs most of all.
"What happened?" asks Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," she'll say to Greene happily.
"I just don't think the whites then called "n-r" that tone."
“Exactly,” one of the actors of the black skin excites.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the sense of convergence.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to be made behind four victims of the massacre.
The actors are repeating the scene.
This time Rascona puts emphasis on the correct saying of the word N.
No one's laughing anymore.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Say, shoots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black is standing over the bodies of actors and is a heartbreaking song by Billie Holiday, Strange Fruit.
With every word, it's sad in the room.
At the background of all this, there are about a dozen eyesighting sweats and tears from the eyes.
In the audience there is practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple came all the way from New York's Ithaca, many of the surrounding area.
Each of them endures the local wet climate for almost eight hours and Brooks leads them to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves in the crowd.
Until this moment, murders could be viewed with distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is spooky.
With the last words of the song, Greene's crowd will call for body inspection.
The kids are bowing to the victims' heads, watching fake blood, and moving bodies, and whispering in their ears.
"They're not dead," a little boy will suffer.
It'll take a few minutes and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean the rope and grow their tears.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of Kukluxlan.
Nick Rascona will embrace two of her friends and cry in their arms; eventually, emotions are upon him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that roles are bad for you.
But you had a reason."
Later that day, the audience and the actors will meet for dinner.
At one young white couple's table, they're talking about a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words to express her feelings for today's performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those ugly words and to look at those disgusting acts... that people like you do because they look like you,” she said for reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topic," she added, "only called police violations".
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the courtroom enjoying dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already started planning a performance for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear that we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think about," he said.
“If we don’t learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love instructions for use.
A friend of mine says that only a coward reads instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where the instructions for using anything was rather a rational phenomenon.
So, for example, my first turntable contained only one paper on which there were hieroglyphs showing the involvement of some components, and there were some secret brands for all of them.
After years, when something went wrong inside me, I offered the letter to the shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back board.
With a grin, he advised me what the labyrinth line paper was for.
Yes, it was a customary device for chronic toilet paper depletion.
He found the wire in play and allowed me to listen to the precious vinyl cookies again.
A new time has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where it simply stuck to the overcrowded grep, required about ten images.
Especially successful was a sketch with a description of how to insert one part into another.
The set was two-part and another procedure was simply impossible.
To give it the opposite required considerable efforts with the need to remove certain plastic components.
My contempt for the instructions ended with my Seat Leon Samodil.
The year of production 2003 had a book with a manual for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of the blinker bulb.
It was easy.
Three steps in total, and the work was supposed to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual neglected to mention that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
One, pull off the cover.
2. Screw off the burst light bulb and screw up the new one.
3. Remove the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first I thought that by moving the right upper limb into the body of the car I would rub some spring, screw, which I would easily pull off and then I would follow points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
It's a gag mistake.
The cover had no space, no space, no slender hand, no obese Sleman.
I've lost half an hour of my life without success.
The state was still empowered by my wife's entry into the garage, which he called the rythm and the words that he heard from my mouth quite extraordinaryly.
"What are you doing here?" she asked absolutely.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I skip the vulgar terms, there were only two published words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she risked a sentence that could be her last in a long-lasting union.
I slowly explained the problem to her, and I put the main emphasis on the torture of the author of the instruction, where the blessing of the hot iron on the hand that wrote the instructions, then the comfort of her never being able to write anything again, was just an introduction to a wide range of instructions by Kladiva on the witch, including his commissional burn on top of the Losinian castle.
"How about we remove the box?" said the woman of the battery assembly.
In clear despair this happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as at the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day my colleague called, who was just discussing his collapse after having checked two officials of the State Drug Control Department.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has also experienced the impossible, and who can interpret wild stories with an unnerving voice.
"Concede that I have received a fine for not being put up for hand washing instructions," he told me with a weak voice.
I gradually figured out the whole problem that he was facing in the fact that he didn't have a picture of washing his hands over the sink in the patient's toilet.
His argument was that adults were generally able to wash their hands, and that there was no need for pictograms to handle the usual activity of decent people, had no healing effect and cost him little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinsing of soapy palms running with water is the primitive action at the level of the cromance that a modern person, Homo sapiens sapiens, is carrying out this ceremony in ten steps.
So it must be said that it is necessary to let go of the tap water.
The whole process has 11 points in total, but at the end of it is a joyous finding that a man washed his hands just as a hosudar from SÚKL ordered.
In the end, I must point out that I've been inspired and prepared a detailed plan to operate in the bathroom.
The procedure is uniform, there is no problem, in urination, due to certain differences in both sexes, it will be necessary to set out instructions two.
The problem remains with these pictograms, as creating a perfect procedure means a precise drawing of all the anatomical details, which could wake up a certain indignation with the pruder's visitor, resisting the fact that he could finally learn that he was washing the opening in a completely wrong procedure throughout his life.
Pearson will release another 3000 employees and reduce dividends in an attempt to reinvigorate business
On Friday, the British educational group Pearson stated that they would release another 3000 employees and reduce the provisional dividend by 72 percent in response to the next restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which will occur at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, according to the Executive Director John Fallon, followed by the previous decision of the company to release 4000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a cost reduction plan of another 300 million pounds in May ($394 million) to reduce costs in order to resurrect declining trade as a result of the sharp development of digital education.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, stated that the outlook for this year remained unchanged after it announced a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
The attack on the convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide explosion
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan Kabul. One NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were injured, reported official officials.
Five soldiers and interpreter were injured, as stated in NATO's statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in Qarabagh County in an attack.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday in an explosion in the Heratian Mosque.
On Monday, a suicide attacker killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that the explosion took place on Tuesday after the patrol and the members of the Afghan army were attacked by “a local person with a pomace produced by an explosive device”.
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are outside the threat of life and are located in the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram Air Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is an important source of concern for NATO's Allied Forces in the nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital city.
At the end of July, a bomb located in a car killed at least 30 people in Shia's Kabul district.
The Taliban applied for the attack.
On May 31, he killed a major explosion in the center of the city of more than 150 people. This is the most deadly militant attack in the country since the U.S. troops destroyed the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining an already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of American soldiers who should help military troops and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks have been shattered by the school in recent weeks by trusting the public in the government, its regulation, and particularly in the reputation of President Asraf Ghanín.
The EPA has re-evaluated its decision to withdraw smoking rules in response to the complaint
The U.S. Environmental Agency has withdrawn its decision to postpone Obama administration law, which has ordered the state to reduce emissions, only the day after 15 countries were sued.
The EPA announced in Wednesday night hours its decision on the delegation of "Ozone Standards 2015" with the words that it presents the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and listen to their views,” said EPA Director Scott Pruitt.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's efforts to delay the ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of most democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., brought an action on Tuesday, on the ground that EPA's conduct is illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump seeks to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in order to kick economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have started countermeasures by democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA says on its website that air breathing with ozone content “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
Singing singer Ladislav Bubnar got hit and blood flowed!
This, with us a quite new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer has organized a monstrous event on the Czech conditions, where he hosted such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and no one else has modernized the event than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show themselves to the public and to introduce his music video to the song Sara, whose baptism was hosed by just named personalities.
Few people already know that the filming of the video, which took place in Russia, did not go without any problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnar had to be treated.
It was his first big film with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it didn't go without a lot of trouble.
Sara's song is very emotional and based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, in the video, the singer's juice indicated a blow to the pipe.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and straight in the nose that a young singer had to be treated by a doctor.
"It was this morning, I didn't expect it, I immediately started blood from my nose," commented Ladislav on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said it was an unfortunate coincidence and Ladislav did not have time to react.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the continuation of the next shooting.
The video of the young artist we are bringing to you now, you can also record the scene with a strike.
The failed version of the blood, however, was not better used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibility of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting boxing match in a lightweight, met for the first time on Tuesday.
Each of them was located in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated champion in the lightweight World Boxing Council - did not meet down to the hall where Lomachenko welcomed, the champion in the cocky vase of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in a Saturday game at Showtime, both boxers got on the list of the top five boxers with a light weight.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager of Lomachenko Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxer fight would be a "excellent test".
“I’m an ex-Pierceweight Champion,” said Garcia.
“I had to add to my fight with the Broner (67 kg), but I’m not that big.
I'm short on my 63 kg.
I'd like to go back to the light weight category.
Lomachenko has to gain again to get lightweight... then we can get together.
That's what fans want.
Why not do it to them?"
Lomachenko agrees.
"Box would benefit this fight."
Klimas raised a demand to pay attention - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should take his debut at the end of this year and the next year to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also expressed interest in the duel match of Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete for the title of lightweight in the arena Forum on September 23.
“The match should take place in a way of viewing payments, that is what fans are asking for,” said Garcia, who later said that it is open to broadcast the game via a television station that will come with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will ever get that much attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said that he recognized Lomachenko as "a wonderful boxer," and could take part in his Saturday fight.
Lomachenko, however, did not get his praise to Garcia when he said that the champion of the three Divisions of Riverside looked "very slow... I'm sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt a growing tension in front of each other.
"You'll never forget this game.
No other game is going to get so much attention.
And I will put great comfort in the fire," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great game."
A young couple of 12 years ago disappeared without a trace.
They found their car at the bottom of the Volhy now.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
They were followed up by an extensive search, but without success.
Finally, the police ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, a sad ending came.
The wreckage of their car found a lay diver on the bottom of the Volhy river in Čeboxary, Čuvash.
Only thanks to the documents left in the car, the police managed to identify a few.
The papers survived the entire decade under water, without them it would take the police much longer to find out the identity of the found.
The couple were last seen when Zirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
So far, the diver that discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboxor police, who pulled the car up to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frosty journey leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its completion.
The latest test results for establishing the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum seekers' tests in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people have been questioned as over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish forensics medical agency (Rôttsmedicinalverket) began to perform new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the context of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failure to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
As of today, the Swedish migration agency has presented the results for the investigation of 6880 cases and the forensic medical agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were assessed as over 18 years of age, while in the next 25 cases, the forensic medical agency considered that the question was “probably over 18 years of age”.
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the asked one was “probably under 18 years of age”.
The tests shall only be used if the age of the contested person is disputed.
According to Johan Gêsransson from the forensic medical agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"Compared to last month's statistics are kept in the tracks and numbers are very similar," said The Local.
A higher number of candidates whose age was estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases ‘the person concerned is 18 years of age or older’.
The papers of Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the questionnaire stated that it would be 18 years old this year.
The criteria have also been met by a medical method for determining the age, which includes the X-rays of the teeth of wisdom and MRI of the knee joints, which subsequently assess dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, which deals, among other things, with the assessment of the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person has undergone puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue, and I do not think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we cannot determine the age with accuracy, we should not pretend otherwise," the Metro newspaper said.
The forensic medical agency Agency’s Gêšransson defended the decision by saying: “In general, it can be said that the risk of wrong assessment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person in question is just below the 18-year-old limit, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of everyone in question."
Trump threatened President Mexico on the phone.
American President Donald Trump in a January call to the Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto threatened not to meet with him if he publicly says that his country will not be paying for the construction of a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump in the interview said that the financing would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that he would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It comes from the transcripts of interviews published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump built a wall on the southern border behind Mexican money one of the main promises in his last year's election campaign.
Right in the first interview with the Mexican president shortly after joining Trump Peña Neto's office, he was undiplomatic for building critically his plan to build a wall.
He described the Southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," said Trump repeatedly in an interview on 27 January and threatened to interrupt his contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to make a rebuttal statement.
They say that funding is going to come up with something, and it's going to end well.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," said Trump, U.S. daily.
The wall has identified as the least important thing we're talking about, but it's probably the most important thing politically.
The executive order to build the Trump wall was issued shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico's construction and financing of walls with a length of 3,200 kilometres refused, and the relations between the two countries have also erupted.
At the end of March, Trump said that the project would still apply to the United States.
Trump finally met with his Mexican counterpart at the G20 summit in Hamburg for the first time.
The Washington Post also informed about Trump's telephone interview with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull from January 28.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
To that end, he was given an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for accepting persons from internationalisation facilities in the Pacific Island States.
First, Trump considered the deal stupid, but then he came up with it.
"You certainly can say that this is not the deal you created, but you will have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, the telephone interview with Turnbull was almost hungry, for example, when Trump appreciated the good idea of Australian refusal to receive refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," said Trump.
But suddenly the tone of the conversation has gone out.
"I hate accepting these people," said Trump.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They will not be great people who will go to work for local milkers," he said.
He also noted in the interview that a fugitive could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump was at the end of January, about a week after he came to the White House, phone interviews with a number of world statesmen, often several during one day.
He finally called the least enjoyable guy in the whole day.
Before he ended it, he pointed out he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed Rana's killer before the crowd.
Her father was watching too.
The execution took place on the square in Yemen Saná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little Ran Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped a girl, took him to his father's house, where he raped her, and strangled her with his bare hands.
Then he raped her body, which he then threw near the mosque.
A violent death of a little girl hit an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari was standing in the front row of a thousand - headed crowd that met to witness execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was sentenced under the law of Sharia.
After the execution, the victim's father told the media his feelings.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
Even the other members of the family were present, and together with the crowd they shouted the password "let justice live."
A rapist in the square brought a police van from which he was removed.
The cops put him on the stomach.
One of the members turned his gun against him and fired from the immediate vicinity.
The present crowd celebrated every blow that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah, and the law of Sharia won," he added.
I was standing at Sana Square, waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife and I Jamileh are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered in the square would fall through hateful madness, grab and lynch the killer.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of Shia Hútí.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 whip wounds immediately after being arrested, but his act caused such an indignation that the judge decided to die.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, they discovered evidence that a man had planned his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to the morning.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that brought Ran's body were terrible," he told the media.
"The morning disappeared this afternoon, we reported it to the police, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her picture hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from killer parents who suspected their son of a terrible act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, must have been hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body was found.
Rana used to play out with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We were walking around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we were looking for nothing.
People of Yemen were detested by crime and began to gather in front of a police station where al Maghrabi was held and to demand immediate punishment.
The D.O.D. has read the mob's evidence of an investigation to calm them down.
Apparently, the accused showed no regret over his act.
Right before the execution of the sentence, the police read him a verdict, but the sentenced only looked at his executioner for a summer.
The whole event was recorded for national television, but there were many records on the Internet that the crowd received.
Governor of West Virginia announced a change of political party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced at President Trump's meeting on Thursday night that he was going to another party.
"While you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their back on me," said the Governor of Justice.
"Today, after a long prayer and thought, I tell you... today as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer support you from the position of a democratic governor."
The crowd of those who are watching blew up in joy.
"Tomorrow, I will join the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a coach, I can tell you that it's time to go to another game."
Trump had already promised people an important announcement at meetings in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited great property from his father and owns several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at 1.59 billion dollars.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, saying: “The running over of the Governor of Justice is another blow for a democratic party that puts obstacles in our way instead of giving reason for the uplifting of our country. ”
"For a democratic party with only 15 governors and controls the least legislative authorities in history, the announcement of the President of Justice is the last drop for an already impoverished party without a leader who seeks to find a positive and unifying report," said President Ronna McDaniel in his statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "direct" apology for a doping scandal
The former ex-con Sebastian Coe praised Russia for his sincere apology for the doping scandal on Thursday, but repeated that Russia had not yet had the right time to return to the sports world.
The head of the Russian athlete Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the MS in athletics - that the extermination of his country from the world of sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who lost the gold and silver medals in this way. ”
Despite its comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban, which entered into force in November 2015, after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report showed that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think we have witnessed a very sincere response and presentation today," said President IAAF Sebastian Coe.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had made a mistake and were working hard to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation."
Coe said that he was also "consolidated" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have progressed to another stage, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the emergency staff on the maintenance of the sentence that was imposed on Russia," Coe added.
“In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilise the situation.
Our efforts have always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest ones," he concluded.
At MS in athletics, which begins on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with strict IAAF rules will compete under the neutral flag.
The head of the IAAF Rune Andersen crisis crew on Monday said that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
Drug tests are still inconvenient and the exclusion of trainers continue to operate, told reporters in London after the presentation of the IAAF board.
The CzechTrade State Contract has been awarded by the company Františka Savova, whose state is being prosecuted.
The publication of the Young Front by František Savova was awarded to the public contract of the state export agency CzechTrede.
Officials awarded him 100 percent of points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state was prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and asking for its publication in the Czech Republic.
In April, the Ministry of Industry and Trade Proexport Agency published a public contract on a four-year supply of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
A contract worth CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the publisher of the Young Front of entrepreneur František Savov.
In 2014, the Czech police accused him of tax evasion and prosecuted him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic asks for his release.
The case was alerted to the server Current.cz.
According to the original criteria, the Czechtrade was to decide on a 60 percent price offered and on the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion helped Savov’s company.
According to information Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all sub-criteria of quality.
This is what moved her to another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, who offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with 404 900 crowns per month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
In contrast to the Young Front, however, 62 points were obtained from the assessors in all the qualitative criteria under average.
Tendru was also attended by the consultant BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which falls the same way as the server Update.cz under the publishing house Economia.
The publisher of VLM objected to the result of the tender with a view to considering its evaluation to be unfair and inadequately justified.
Following their refusal, it decided to challenge competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the ÚOHS.
He believes that CzechTrande has acted contrary to the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the supplier of the public contract on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favoring the participant Young Front, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers," writes in the proposal to initiate the procedure lodged at the ÚOHS this week, which published the server Currently.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee seems to be an untrustworthy and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project in all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," Klíma said.
CzechTrede has not yet expressed its view on the situation.
The CzechTred Agency does not generally comment on public contracts prior to their conclusion.
All information about you mentioned contract is in accordance with the law published in the profile of the contracting authority and in the Villager of public contracts.
"After the contract has been concluded, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot speak to it," said the media representative of Štěpán Dlouhý.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that the publication of Economia hit an article in Actuala.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this has been mentioned in that Article.
In the tender, she was the one who provided the BusinessInfo Editorial Service portal in the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led by Martim Kuba ODS.
Františka Savova blames the police on tax evasion in connection with excessive deductions of VAT on its companies, which have caused the Czech state an alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its release since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the NO Andrej Babiš movement is behind his criminalization, under whose influence is the label Mafra.
The London court rejected the appeal last year, but the entrepreneur appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not gone anywhere since last year, from Great Britain we have not been given any notice in the case of the acquisition of the law," said Štěpánek Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague City Council.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was established in Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Czech-Budějovice Brewery Samson, and in the Cyprus company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
He should also control the failed Heavy Machinery Services company, earlier Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was associated with the removal of assets from the former Socialist Society of Youth.
The biker was riding the pavement and the park, and he ended up in the moats.
The biker drew attention to himself by taking careless rides along the streets, pavements and park trails in Úšovice.
When the patrol started following him, he decided to take her in the direction of the Department.
"Policemen of men were careful to follow the city when he failed to drive on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Spa and entered the field where he crashed with the motorcycle," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to come to the accident, which transported the injured biker to the Plzeň hospital.
Next, the police discovered that the biker's own driving licence, registration marks on the motorcycle had been stolen, his production number had been scrapped and the production label itself had been removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breath test carried out at the place of presence of alcohol in the driver was excluded, but a positive result on the substance methamphetamine was found," said the police spokesperson.
How the financial rules of football affects Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar's record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in prestigious Liza champions.
The rules of financial fair play (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 provide that the PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without great losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million to buy Neymara out of its contract and Neymar will require a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
Followed by several financial conditions of Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is financed by a rich Cathar family that has become rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar to such a star football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts for the purchase of players, but on the other hand they must demonstrate legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead costs of business activities related to football.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after joining the UEFA director's seat in 2007.
A former French player believed that clubs in pursuit of new reinforcements would eventually cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to provide them.
In 2011, the FFP rules redirected their attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramevich used with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and to spend hot sums on players to build a global brand - suddenly it was not so beneficial.
As part of the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may lose EUR 30 million.
Despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander Cheferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules still apply and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," said the Associated Press Andrea Traverso last week, who supervises compliance with the FFP rules.
Although PSG paid Neymara in one-off payment, it may spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44,4 million annually for a period of five years.
The first wave of the highest FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA takes care of teams that can attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Catarian company sponsors PSG, once the financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
In 2014, UEFA adopted a similar measure after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to PSG was too high.
According to some reports, a part of Neymar’s revenue in PSG could be paid from the organizational committee MS in football 2022 in Qatar.
However, PSG and the representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar denied the fact that Neymat should become the ambassador of MS in football and that such a maneuver would be easily revealed by UEFY actors.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to the Tuesday commissioned UEFA, there was no investigation into Neymara's transfer to PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as it was not entitled to comment on the PSG situation, said The Associated Press.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed the year 2015-2016 with net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymara's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and sales of uniforms.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
The Spanish League leaders, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the greatest stars, sought to freeze Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would violate the rules of the FFP.
“It is a clear case of “financial doping” of both the club and the state,” said President of the League Javier Teba for Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of PSG by the Catalan Syndicate.
Arsenalu's manager Arsenalus Wenger, whose club owns the American sports magnate, shares the same position of La League on the financing of the club.
“This is the result of ownership that has changed the football world from scratch over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as the club’s owner becomes, anything can be done.
Keeping to the rules of financial fair play is very difficult, because the State may have different interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartan backupr Rosický: Changes are painful, but we must believe.
Sixteen thousand accommodating leg fans.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the square.
Same scene as in a Sunday game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan backupr has moved against Crvena Zvezda's game, he has invented several generals, but his teammates have not headed for the black one.
The air team pumped with new multimillion reinforcements, so after the initial double match in European cups, ends.
Was it hard to do anything else after the Belgrade goal?
Four shots were required after the goal was recovered, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted not to lose, to raise our self-confidence, so that we might have something to bounce back into the next fight.
We had a chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the game so long?
The game is so busy.
The opponent's combination was much better than ours.
We didn't get anything. We fired in half the time, like, once.
That's obviously very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you have to push your opponents more often into such positions.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the lineup?
Of course, it's one of the pains of being a new team.
We've only played three competitions, and the line-up is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect 11 to sit down.
Is it encouraging that you've already played a part of two games over?
It's still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition is going to develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that happened in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise we can't.
It's the same thing with the injury.
If you don't believe it, you can't come back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
Fans came again in great numbers, but they left in despair.
What can you tell them?
Once again, there was a wonderful visit, just like with God.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with better performance.
Show me something they'll come up with next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far we're fighting ourselves, we're playing each other, so that's not the advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is supposed to be in prison for ten years.
The Constitutional Court has rejected a complaint from a businessman named Jiří Toman, who is expected to serve ten years in prison for reducing taxes to a large extent.
The figured damage amounts to CZK 645 million.
In a complaint, Toman claimed that justice violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlin and Olomouc were not complete.
However, constitutional judges found the complaint unfounded, found the CTC from the Court's database.
US is not another appeal court.
"Can't judge, as a fourth instance, the facts or legal doubts alleged by the general courts if they do not constitute an infringement of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been in force since November 2015, when the Supreme Court in Olomouc confirmed it.
At that time, Toman was in the publishing custody of Argentina, where he was also in accordance with the resolution at the time of the decision of the U.S.
The imposed penalty is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court identified the case as an extreme tax evasion which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served between 2005 and 2008 as chairman of the World Servis Board of Directors.
The damage of CZK 645 million was created only during the period from January to July 2008, the overall escape according to the expert exceeded the billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the prosecution, World Servis did not include all the invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT contributions and excise duties, at least tens of millions of crowns paid taxes in mere hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company was trading have a relationship with the entrepreneur Radomír Selecter, who has been responsible for the handling of VAT in the 13 years of prison.
He also rejected his complaint before the Constitutional Court.
The series "The Summer to Eternity" and "Comrade Detective" play a nostalgic string
This story is nostalgic for both the characters of the famous 1980s and the dirty 90s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and of course for modern times, namely the year 2001 than stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd started on bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact it is a light parody and also the embodiment of our modern facebook era of permanent memories.
From a French look, it looks like someone's breathing out.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (an example can be the story of the creation of a talking can with vegetables, which H. Jon Benjamin spoke).
The authors deviated from the main funny points - middle-aged actors, who play teenage horny children - and could not tangle with previous events.
The continuation of the "Ten Years Later" in which adults play does not push so much on the emotional plane and satire is very sporadic, including parody on the thrillers of the 1990s as "The Hand on the Wheel".
At one point, the character will be found at a meeting of the Apple Powerbook, roller skates and “a lot of other things from 1991”.
Many major story lines are repeated.
Good - hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now writer, still has not passed over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot, which includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is stimulated by George H. W. Bush (very well occupied by Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of French.
It is especially fun to watch the eternally young Rudd with long hair, an alias the character of Matt Dillon from the film Young, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind the old bell pepper.
France could start the moments of random madness, such as the final series "Seven Up" until it reaches what I suppose will be logical: "Wet Hot American Summer: Tweety Years Later," when the entire group will be released to the premiere of the "Lét to Insurrection".
In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgic: the revitalism of the Cold War of the series "Such Normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No Regrets" and even the series "GLOW" in which the icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes meet.
The comedians of Brian Gatewood and Alessandr Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, are to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania of the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism after Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Streets, who attacked the English language Channing Tatum (the executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as cops watching chess on TV - parody on American football).
The series was given a voice by many famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" is too focused on the illustrious propaganda drama - which includes the killer with Reagan's mask - and according to that it also seems to be.
Six long episodes are too distracting, and comedy moments aren't enough.
With shorter footage, the propaganda satire at the "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly attend the US Embassy, where two fatheads devour burgers stacked at a large meeting.
The clear message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The Romanian creators were right: we do so with our own culture as well as with theirs.
The Russian athletes have not been able to cancel the launch ban from the IAAF.
The International Athletic Federation of the IAAF Congress in London confirmed the extension of the international ban on the start of Russian competitors due to the state-supported Doping Programme.
The vote in the scene of the World Championship, which starts on Friday, was very clear, as expected.
In order to extend the ban, 166 delegates voted, there were only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as stated by the Chief of Special Investigation Group IAAF Rune Andersen in front of the congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspicious athletes have not yet been heard, and trainers still work in the country with a bad reputation.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, has not yet been fully operational.
However, RUSADA can carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and British anti-doping agencies.
"While progress has taken place, there is still a lot of work to be done," said the President of the IAAF Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost last year's Olympic Games in Riu de Janeiro.
Despite the ban of the upcoming MS, 19 Russians will participate, who have previously demonstrated that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
But they won't be able to start at the championships in national colours and if they win, they won't play the Russian anthem.
The Bank of England will hold the interest rate to 0,25 %
The Bank of England should, as expected, announce that the interest rate remains unchanged, following the insignificant economic growth and the weakening of inflation, which has suffocated speculation on rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" in connection with the maintenance of the interest rate - despite the desire for family budgets.
The political factors of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of England voted six to two in order to maintain interest rates at 0.25%. The results of the vote in favour of the increase in interest rates supported by unsustainable economic growth supported by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the bank forecasted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction in family budgets would continue.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that there should be growth over the next few years as a result of inflation caused by Brexit, and it also indicated that housing rents should increase more in financial markets than expected.
The members of the Committee also voted for the withdrawal of part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy, which was put into practice a year ago as a response to Rexit.
As a result of the above mentioned provision should start from next February with the schedule of timely financing which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, although Bank of England has stated that it will now offer £15 billion less than planned £15 billion.
Just before the decision, the Bank stated: ‘The MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, together with the pressure on real household income and consumption.’
On tariffs, the Bank stated that it would be necessary to ‘touch out money’ to calm inflation, namely ‘to a greater extent’ than the markets expected.
The markets currently predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the next increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "free" and "limited".
The Bank has reduced its growth forecasts for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The expected growth in 2018 of 1.8 % remained unchanged.
Following the publication of estimates, the pound dropped against the dollar and the euro.
The pound dropped by 0.5% to 1.31 dollars and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the current state came after the disappointing increase buried the hopes of further growth - GDP stopped at 0,3 % in the second quarter compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0,3 % in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it should be slightly increased as stated by the bank.
The latest inflation report is a slight comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor wage increases.
The report further states that monetary policy "can't prevent" income reductions in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also increase thanks to the great interest in British goods thanks to the weak libra, which compensates for the lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came a year after the rate was reduced to 0,025 % in August last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, resulting in a drop in pounds.
The Bank estimates that full unification of prices and economies will take at least four years.
Before the bank’s decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rate increase along with rising inflation, which was putting increasing pressure on the household, and three political actors demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation last month dropped back to 2.6% of June 2.9%, even though the bank stated that such a change had been expected and inflation should rise again in the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess of the relative to the 2 % target was ‘complete’ as a result of a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage brokers, said: “In view of the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition on the mortgage market will only rise once creditors compete for a contract with a view to a good view of the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing contracts and mortgages - there are options free of charge in the offer, as well as the low rates that they gain in popularity."
NHS will prescribe a controversial HIV treatment to 10,000 patients
Patients will gain access to ‘transformative’ treatment to prevent HIV from September on the basis of a decision by the Supreme Court on the financing of NHS.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients to 86%, will be offered by means of a health service to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the Board of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court of the past year, expressing that the NHS had the funds to pay PrEP despite the claim that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by the NHS of England from the mouth of General Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention” while National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “deciding moment”.
The sex health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to receive patients. Other clinics will be joined in October and full implementation will take place by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (Prep) is an HIV medicine taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV to vulnerable patients.
Pre-sex application means that there are sufficient specific medicines in the patient’s body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Test patients include gay or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who will sign approval to participate in the testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also apply to their local clinic of sexual health and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will bring taxpayers to £10 million and the NHS of England signed a drug distribution contract this week after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is proposed for the collection of clinical evidence and assessment of the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and make full use of the constantly expanding and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in more than 30 years' effort to stop one of the biggest challenges of human health.'
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: ‘We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and at risk to patients, it will offer the opportunity to change the HIV epidemic of England.
Since September, NSH will offer patients who are at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful instrument that is individually controlled and is not subject to the need to conjure their partner, leading to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
This declaration is accepted with pleasure.'
Ian Green, Managing Director of Terrence Higgins Trust said: ‘The priority number one must be the rapid deployment of tests throughout the country; we must ensure that it is made available to every patient.
We now have a test drug at our disposal, and we are on good track to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV infection."
The Minister of Health Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of the PEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and delay by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this medicine can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and termination of this life-threatening infection.
The subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to the full understanding of the benefits of the PrEP.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible across the country, protecting people who are exposed to HIV and thus jointly ending the spread of HIV in society."
Life on a high leg: Between the floor and smart design turned this small apartment into Earls Court in a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with passion for real estate, traded a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour.
It is located on the first floor of the clever Queen Anne terrace - and is an overview of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
“I lived with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in Knightsbridge,” said Joanne.
“I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same height of the ceiling.
I fell in love with him right away, and that same day I nodded him."
Since then, he's been through an apartment of 1,000 square feet of complete renovation.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage space and interfloor to use a high ceiling.
“ I longed for a high ceiling, large windows, and plenty of light.
That was my demand," she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used the almost four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights that two gaps would rise above each other - a challenge for architects, so it was a challenge to create an inter-storey on which one could walk uprightly.
Erfan must have involved his creative thinking.
“The steel structure is completely complicated,” he explained.
“We had to set both spaces up so that we could walk uprightly.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full rooms on his own - and at the same time to add to his dramaticity.
In the interfloor looks at the beautiful living room of the old copper window frame in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the front door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the impression of a much larger space to the entire apartment, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen, unless it is used.
The downstairs are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan says of reinforced doors.
"The door is provided with the counterweight to be removed very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to it, what you're selling is a residential area - or appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
‘The real estate broker is essentially counting its price on the basis of the living area.’
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while maintaining the quality materials that lend the space a luxury look.
"Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan added.
“You don’t love electricity distribution in walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts will not be gained."
As it turned out, a quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is breaking up.
The cultural and political gap between blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on travelling its citizens to Tennessee and other seven states.
The State of Tennessee paid her back and declared a retribution ban on traveling its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense that US citizens can travel freely in all 50 countries.
The thing is that California has banned state money from spending on trips of its citizens to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT and any expression of non-consent to LGBT's lifestyle is considered to be discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has adopted a law on the subjection of conscience, according to which a psychotherapist, who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients, does not have an obligation to provide it, but is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have adopted laws whereby religious charity organisations that have been given children from mothers to birth to adoption are not obliged to provide these children with the same sex couples for adoption.
Due to these laws on the reservation of California's conscience, it has banned the financing of the journeys of its citizens to eight countries of the Union from its own resources.
In practice, this means that California’s professors must not have access to a scientific symposia, for example, in Texas, paid back from their universities, because they are co-financed by the State of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They must obtain either federal grants for travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund the travels of citizens from state A to state B or private sponsoring.
The State of Tennessee has become patient, and his parliament has adopted a law with resolutions that he also does not like California's high tax policy, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but he will not impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's giving them a retribution for California's travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union that would order a similar travel ban to another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That fact, now comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing against the system.
States have the right to adopt laws on the subject of conscience as well as to decide what their money is going to be up to and what they cannot do.
Second of all, what's wrong with your conscience?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under penalty when the butchers offering pork is enough?
In Colorado, a baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to cook a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to cook cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes at hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the federation citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policy within the powers that are not federal according to their own preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, the LGBT members once legitimately sought to tolerate their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are guided by the rule of life and should live by which all reasonable people should follow, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to these, no one can ever show any moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if he does, he should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know the situation in American history, where states have been doing such things on account of political issues, except for the one thing.
Even during the struggle for the rights of black people, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of the Segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1950s, the political case was slavery and war against the South.
Of course there will be no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between blue democratic states and red republican states is deepening, and the US is mentally expanding internally.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critic Putin's been fined.
Russian opposition policy Alexey Navalny received a fine of 300 thousand rubles for violating the campaign rules before the presidential elections that will take place next year.
The court imposed a fine on him for inviting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Over the last two months, Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests and announced that he wants to apply for the state's headship in March next year.
Authorising head of the Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not announced his candidacy yet, but in general he is expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He gave him a fine for inviting people to demonstrate through videos on the YouTube web portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them out of the judge's pay later," he joked on a twitter critic of the Kremlin.
The Russian electoral committee has recently concluded that Navalny cannot take part in the presidential elections because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalnyi, who is considered to be a fighter against corruption, considers the relevant judgment politically motivated.
The court also imposed fines of 300 thousand rubles on Thursday, namely 25 thousand rubles, two members of the Navalny election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalnyj entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the shattered opposition scene.
Authorities are trying to defend the Naval in the campaign.
In February he was sentenced to a five-year parole for stealing from Kirovles forestry.
In May, the court of appeal confirmed the verdict.
The judgment is so competent, which, according to the Russian laws, prevents him from running.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of the empire of their Italian family, carry over one of the most expensive Victorian real estates worth more than $500 million.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides in Toorak Manor, only three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who fought for joint property and commercial property until the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly being advocated before the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother, Anna owns 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, the first store was bought by the family on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
At this point, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain with 160 stone stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million in conversion.
For money, other properties and portfolios of the De Lutis family have now included offices, construction land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and business centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the company’s assets, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul’s words, is the “significant driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds of the assets.
Court records say Colin owns $316 million of real estate, while Paul manages the property for 176 million dollars.
Paul has just become a problem with the division of assets and funds.
“Colin’s proposal was very much in his favor in my eyes,” wrote Paul in his sworn statement to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after a few failed attempts at peace, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also competing for who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his statement, cut Colin off.
Colin resists that it's not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some real estate.
In his previous sworn statement, Colin stated that he believed in a successful settlement of the conflict.
“My Italian origin dictates to me that the family is the most important of all,” he wrote.
The costs of court standing are rising. Hundreds of websites of sworn statements, e-mails and company reports, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and defenders of both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants, who had been running dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s, and in the 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
With the money obtained by stopping property they bought real estate in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family company with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “the last year of high school, Paul was just a little, about a 10-year-old boy.”
Anna De Lutis reported that along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of assets to the sons would take place after good.
“Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark, and Luke, who are no longer part of the De Lutis family group, said that Mark was compensated for $10 million at his departure and Luke's 26 million.
As Paul, Luke, and Mark said, “they were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation. ”
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL club, as Eddie McGoire, a famous television personality and the best friend of Colin, said in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paula de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He replied only to Colin by means of a text message in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute is settled before the court, "I have nothing to add".
“It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the whole matter before the court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the statements to the court, Colin stated that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s requirements.
"Our father would be very dissatisfaction if he saw our current situation," he said, "and added that he was still hoping for a successful solution."
On Friday, there was no hope in sight.
“Our disputes will be resolved in the near future,” said Colin.
Warm in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
The MHD drivers prossing both water and summer clothes.
At the secondary school Na Chodovec in Prague 4, which now includes about 35 children, only comes out in the morning.
The school is after reconstruction and so far planted trees do not provide great shade.
There's no pool, but teachers shower children in a nebula.
In the afternoon, children stay in classes where there are closed blinds and closed curtains.
The air is trying to cool the air, because they don't have air conditioning.
It's difficult for teachers and cooks too.
"The temperature that is in the interior and exterior exceeds the hygiene limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open operation during this period," said the head of kindergarten Miloslav Makovičková.
There's a glass corridor in kindergarten where, according to her, the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We blow up in the morning after 6 o'clock, close the windows, and we have the blinds on the south side, which we protect ourselves.
"But it won't help," she added.
The conditions are better in the forest kindergarten at the Hresti in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have trees on the ground, so we're beneath them.
"We have a beautiful peanut under it there is a table, and there we do things," described the headmistress of Barbora Komanová.
Teachers and their children are trying to go to the woods where there's more cold.
The children of wet hat and have different games with water on the program.
"We have a hand-operated sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," said Compan.
The headmistress of kindergarten on Novoborská Street in Prosek Jitka Vilimovská, Prague, also said that teachers of children try to keep their children in the shade and drop them with water.
"We have quite an increase in the garden, so they are under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a headgear.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweetened tea or diluted juice, and in the garden they have pitka with water.
They also have fresh fruit and vegetables for food each day, which parents sometimes bring to them.
"One mother brought here today about a ten-pound melon for children," said Makočková.
Drivers get water or summer uniforms.
The Prague DPP is providing them with hot water, ion drinks or summer uniforms.
The cabs of tram drivers and buses are in most cases air-conditioned, said spokesperson Aneta Řehková.
Some trams are air conditioned in addition to cabins.
So far, high temperature tramways have not seriously damaged anything.
There was a minor damage in the loop in Hostiary.
At current high temperatures, we make sure that the drivers have enough drinks at their disposal.
"Cold drinking water is available in all loops, switching points and roads," said Řehková.
The employees have so-called sodobarys available in the houses and in some alternate places, which produce chilled sodium.
Drivers also receive soluble ion drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the spokesperson said.
The hot and dry weather of recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firemen in the whole Czech Republic disposed of 108, i.e. twice the long-term average.
On Tuesday through the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic were climbing over 35 degrees Fahrenheit, the firemen employed mainly the fight against fire.
"They are predominant by fires in the natural environment and also by those associated with the harvest work," said the spokesperson, Nicole Zaoralová.
The evening weather change did not bring relief to the firemen, when storms and storms changed the heat to a number of places.
In connection with the firestorms, they set off for 236 hits.
It was mainly about removing the burned trees and branches.
"The most affected in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralová continues.
But the firemen needed help in Stvolenky in Czechoslovakia, where they evacuated 60 people from the children's camp because of the storm.
The tropical temperatures have also given work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and at night on Wednesday, ambulances were on their way to ten cases of carbon dioxide poisoning.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, warned by paramedics.
Carbon dioxide is a colourless gas without the smell that is released during imperfect combustion.
The symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, leave the infected room.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media diet.
Many tried before him, and they always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, it will be the first.
Politicalo portal said that the new Chief of Staff at the White House is planning to limit President Trump's information flow - including reports on television news - in the hope that it will keep Trump on the surface.
Here's part of Josh Dawsey's report:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met on the first day in a new post with the staff, he outlined the key problem of Trump’s White House, which intends to correct: the wrong information that gets into the President’s hands.
Kelly announced to the staff that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or spoken word - because the President can decide better on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke teeth at Trump's control and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back for decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV is even stronger.
“If Trump was upset by honest reports as a candidate, it was convenient for him to show that there are a lot of other media that have been easier to convince about him in a positive light,” said Politico Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor in February.
Tara Palmeri from the Politico portal then wrote that “a key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - at least according to the words of six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly observes the media that praises him.”
All right.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his views on Twitter was ever “under control” ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something that others don't know - that Trump's tweets would be more upsetting if someone hadn't checked them.
We'll never know about tweets that Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him at least several times in check, then their efforts did not go off in vain.
However, no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from encouraging controversial issues.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by subsidizing Trump's materials - which they can but may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
In May, Politico, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the tendency of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from Shane Goldmacher's pen:
“The current and former Trump officials claim that the President often reacts very hard to the media’s negative reports, especially to leak reports, and seeks to find their origin.
This occurred at the end of February when someone planted a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the website of the provocative Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source of many leaks of information” from the White House.
No matter how much Johnson has been reported on Twitter for harassment, or that he has not made any evidence of his claims; or that he has made false accusations in the past and subsequently dismissed them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the former chief of staff of Reince Priebus and the White House Secretary Rob Porter, "trying to implement the system for the management and documentation of information that President Trump would receive".
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to enforce the same strategy.
Maybe it turns out he's a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulses don't just disappear, and his helpers are still competing for power.
These immutable factors of Kelly's mission will certainly be burdened.
Tourists negotiate for the moat and return to the 'Million Quarter'
Several of the most immovable homeowners in the English county of West Midland are again going to the top with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities for the right to regain their field for their headquarters.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near a thriving street in Solihull, called the “million-dollar district”.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after they were declared in May. They did not hesitate to find a moat that was excavated on the spot on the basis of authorities' orders in order to prevent their invasion.
The tact group found gaps in defense and penetrated the field with caravans unprotected by the gap that served as a journey.
The residents of the neighborhood attacked the Board of Directors of the city of Solihull, with the fact that “they are unable to solve the problem.”
One of the people who wanted to remain anonymous said: “They planted that place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All tourists were moved to a different place and now they're back.
Another one arrived last night, and today there'll be about more.'
She added that : ‘Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't intend to pay any more taxes until the board of directors deal with tourists.
Another anonymous resident said, ‘It’s ridiculous. We’ve just been watching the last departing tourists, and now they’re back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they brought horses with them.'
The spokesperson of Solihull’s Board of Directors said: ‘We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem successfully.
To gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible announce any non-social or unlawful conduct to the police at number 101.
This will give us an overall picture, which we will present in court.'
The MEP's husband hit a car in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special took the wounded Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava in Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport, and he was under constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-term flight covered itself without complications.
Róbert Zitňanský reportedly had a serious accident at the beginning of the summer in Brussels.
He's been hit by a car, and he's been in serious condition ever since.
After transporting to his homeland he was transported to a specialised workplace of one of Bratislava hospitals.

The Italians confirm in the fight against escape ship NGOs with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NG rescue ships arriving on the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean if the NGOs do not sign the new rules governing their operations.
“If the NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to continue their operations,” said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated Jugend Rettet's ship for suspected trafficking in human beings, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which works for the first year, refused to comment on the whole issue because of an accusation by the Italian State Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
"There is always a priority for us to save human lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones," she said in her statement on social networks.
"We can only comment on all the current charges after gathering all the information and evaluating the whole situation."
The Italian authorities have been tracking the Iuvent ship of Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected to have carried immigrants on board, which were handed to them directly by human traffickers over and over again.
Only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya, according to the applicant's file. The meeting was published by the Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of violating the law and circling the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have yet to agree to comply with the Code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The recently appointed organisation stated on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable as they do not represent any ‘substantial change or obstacle’ in relation to rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new code of conduct was rejected by the Organization of Doctors without Borders (MSF), which holds the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minniti has been told that the sharp decline in immigrants in the last few weeks who are landing in Italy in the context of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and to cooperate with local mayors bear fruit.
"In the last days we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
It has also revealed plans for further negotiations this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Nasty Mesaroš: Silicone and cellulite came from overal!
Hot summer days are all they want to wear is the most necessary thing to cover up the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesaroš does the opposite.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, moderators, singers, and everyone who has anything to do with TV Prima, it just sprung, its body shrouded in a mini oververal.
And all it took was a few ordinary moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her buttocks.
Well, it's just that overal's cut himself in the middle of half a dozen times, plus he's been dumped so high, she's had to change it all the time.
There is no need for the attention of the masters and present photographers.
Michelle Carter has been sentenced to send text messages encouraging Conrad Roy's suicide.
The woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to jail in the last two years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
The 20-year-old Michelle Carter is going to sit for 15 months from a two-year sentence behind bars and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was sentenced in June for the inadvertent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said in court on Thursday: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision.
She was threatened by 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter was standing at the time of the judgment at the scene with tears in her eyes, clasped with her hands and eyes pointing towards the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
“She ended his life to ease herself.
She couldn't take her own responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no regret."
However, the attorney Carter said that these were “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regretted. ”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “its age or maturity or even mental impairment have no significant impact on its conduct”.
She read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “There will be no one day for me not to grieve over the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care about his sisters and we will endure the great pain that we will bear with us forever," said he.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was "happened" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be the aunt of his children.
"The loss of the person I've been seeing since I was born is the pain I'm going to carry for life," she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law to punish a person who helps kill the other person, so the case is founded by a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in the car seat in 2014, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after the text messages published by Carter, which stimulated suicide.
“You need both, jump out of the building or get stabbed, I don’t care,” says Carter on the text messages she sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "It's just that you throw the generator and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to abstain from any press comments.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who stood on Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves to understand and help, not prison.”
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Just the day before the announcement, the Audi car manufacturer BMW stated that it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
President BMW said that society believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the seat of BMW - which are considering bans or restrictions on diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would modify three million Mercedes vehicles across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted the large extent of the use of diesel atuomobils in Europe and the United States to comply with the Regulation on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen dioxide that releases diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of cars to install installations for neutralising the gas produced by diesel engines is increased, making it more difficult for cars to compete.
While German car manufacturers are facing careful inspections, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing charges of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid errors of Volkswagen, which in an attempt to meet the emission limits installed in its cars software, which reduced the amount of emissions issued during testing, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen have been accused in the United States and others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in Germany would be arrested by an Audi engine development department.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian nationality and is therefore not subject to extradition, so he can face the trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation by the German police in the case of Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of installing the system that was supposed to circumvent European emission limits - to expand the charges that Audi is facing in the US.
The inclusion of the Audi car manufacturer in the investigation may have an infallible impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is an disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
The plane has landed on the beach with an emergency.
A man and a girl died.
The accident occurred on the Praia de São João beach in the Costa da Caparica area, approximately 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the Witnesses to the TV channel SIC Noticias said that the plane was flying just over the people who were sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people on the beach were supposedly fleeing from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
A 50 - year - old man and an eight - year - old girl died on the beach according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead at the scene," described local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them got out alive from the accident, and the cops took them for questioning.
D11 or how to build a freeway.
And are motorways in the Czech Republic even finished?
I'll give you a puzzle.
It's unfinished, even though it started to be built in 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's getting better all the time.
And it can't be built anymore, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, D11 Castle Highway.
The construction of another section of it for at least a few months has now stopped the Children of Earth movement.
We east-easters get a freeway by bit, like when the salami is cut.
They'll cut off the wheel and then they'll see when and if we'll get another one.
But we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get the truck going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite streams of truckers go directly through the cities of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not wise to go around.
But so far, the last section of our dream highway was launched in 2008 before the incredible nine years.
Not a knock since.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section of Hradec Králové began to be built recently, and on other sections of Jaroměř, an archaeological survey began to begin to build at the end of this year, you could hear a loud booming of the pints in Eastern Bohemia.
Nobody ever believed that.
Last week it turned out not to come this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children's Country Club for Sustainable Transport from Brno reported a decomposition.
The Earth's children are repeating their D1 tactics.
Decisions on building permits have been taken in full.
They shall require a review of all already issued binding opinions of all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Castle Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Office.
So far, we're leaving the D11 near the village with the eloquent name Funeral.
So we're going down, we're just going down the highway, and we're suddenly standing on the side road, and we prefer to go into the column.
The worst part is you see similar stories all over the country.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benesov, D1 or D8 motorway.
Everyone's got a funeral.
What do Earth Children demand?
What is the essence of the construction problems in the Czech Republic?
And why is the existing motorway network virtually inexhaustible in the existing system?
Read in the new reflex.
Levandule from Provence threatens climate change
Levandules have become a symbol of Provence in the south-eastern France, but they are now threatened by climate change.
Levandula falls due to the dry climate and harmful insect, causing horror on the faces of researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence has been threatened because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less precipitation in spring and autumn.
It affects the life of lavender.
It is also their fault that the cicadas and herbivores carry micro-bacteria, which are successful in the dry climate."
There's a lot at stake.
Levandule attracts tourists and the oil they produce is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The city of long and beautiful flowers is growing smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
Of course, the quantity of oil obtained from these lavender is smaller."
A possible solution can be a more efficient distribution of water and a slowdown of water evaporation from the soil, but also a lavender spray with a protective mixture of clay and water and nobles of more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights increasing threats in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoc meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss the news of the unrest that takes place in the Sinaloa area with the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials and non-consolidation of drug wars.
Today, however, it is mostly because of its own safety under the pressure of recent events.
They find it important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office where someone attacked by a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to name each word - there is no need for any evidence, just use imagination and premonition.
Choose what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspects of taking money from governments or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover criminal acts.
The violence continues and the bodies grow across the country; journalists continue to grow among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, there are at least 25 of them from the accession of President Enrique Pen Net to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven were killed in all seven states this year.
Among them are the co-founder of Riodice, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence associated with drug trafficking.
His loss is palpable, although his presence is omnipotent - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription “Justice” shown by the middlemen, hanging in front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - in the age of over 30, have a T-shirt with a smile on their face, glasses on their nose and a hat of Panama.
The meeting is held less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010, in order to deal with cases of journalists, two suspects have so far been sued by the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that happen every year are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime, so the journalists' killers get to court very exceptionally.
The reporters in Riodoc insist on informing about the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; even though they are destroyed by grief and the land in question is now very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without seeing justice, the safety meeting is irrelevant, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoc in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to escape several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently due to the name of the article - which can be translated as the 12th River.
The shooters then boarded his car and crashed him not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
It seems that rumors are spreading rapidly in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since last year's Guzman's arrest and its January edition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest fighting sites in the country as the rival faction tries to fill an empty place.
A few people are killed every day in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of two storey mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget about a moment, the word "failure" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel to the United States of America drugs.
In support of this, as well as the fact that Valdez was familiar with the risks of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Rioduce still blames himself for not protecting his friend.
She believes that two doubts contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that led the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzman.
The peace could be angered by the sons; the suspicious gang members bought all the copies of the paper when they landed on the floor.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after he confiscated other newspapers in which the same story was found.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He lived so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In Noroeste's periodical he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and set up with five Riodoc colleagues.
In Sinaloe, “it was impossible to operate a newspaper and not to mention drug trafficking,” Bojorquez said.
In time, Riodace gained a good reputation for brave and true intelligence; the news began to succeed.
Journalists liked to go after problem topics and publish texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the founding, Rioduce won the prestigious Maria Moores Cabot for a report on Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award to the Journalist Protection Committee for his brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted he was afraid.
"I was afraid for my life," he said when accepting the prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is "the way of life", said Valdez last October in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
“You need to take on the role of a journalist — or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do to the face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The employees of Riodoc miss Valdez, a man known for his witty and unchosen language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hug – a teacher who knew how to survive.
They were all counting on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to El Guayabo bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: has this routine caused his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
"They don't like you getting involved with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel there's something going on here, hands off.
The problem is, editor of Riodace Andres Villarreal said that "the smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then there was that thing with Javier."
The old rules according to him, and according to others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the meeting room of Riodoc staff; a few days ago, a spyware was discovered that bought governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief before 40 degrees of heat in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the State to protect Riodoc offices located in a four-storey building in the Culiacan district.
The reporters are taunting the fact that these cops aren't one of those 50 percent law enforcement officers who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It's been a few months since journalists last went to mountainous areas that basically control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first is the murder of former boxer brother Julio César Chávez in Sinaloe.
They are also lit up for suspicious government spending in the hometown of the Governor of the State.
There have been recent kidnappings in one of Culiacan's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the state's attorney's office.
Officially, no one has reported the identity of the abducted people or the circumstances of kidnapping, so journalists were careful when they were about writing about what every resident of the city knows: that she restaurant is a popular destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist noted from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of political scene almost all over the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with high-profile corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including the incident in which one of the sons of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzman escaped the military intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about this in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villarreal (46), who is named "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a sign and sticker warehouse to protest against the killing of journalists, and employees certainly didn't expect them to become activists in the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught several signs and went to demonstrate herself in front of the state's attorney's office next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a burnt body was discovered, the authorities say it's Adamea's DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is increasing throughout the country, many of which are organising protests and staring at pavements and buildings "SOS press".
The director of the newspaper Bojorquez is a day to visit Washington, where he tries to get international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who was held the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of watching journalists and their murder of reporting the truth.
In the meantime, she asked for a transfer to another department of fears that her anger might compromise her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "encouraged" by organised crime, corrupt officials and indifferent public.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that journalists die not only by the hands of drug cartels, but also by order of politicians and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The Articulo Media Supervisory Group 19 accused more than half of all attacks on journalists of police officers and public officials.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," added Ramirez.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of a blogger named Marie Elizabeth Macías, who occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note reportedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: “This is how I ended up for my messages. ”
There were keyboards and headphones next to the cut head.
Some branches have decided to put an end to activities such as the El Norte newspaper, based at the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of the rapporteur, Miroslava Breach.
The others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after killing their director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels by an article on the opening page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their homes or even across borders.
It's an easy decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after he fled Veracruza.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, there is a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet once, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexiko is going to hell, which is why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight and Riodoc's employees are sitting on the pavement in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone suddenly starts to ring.
They find that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and policemen near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left in this area promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoc website.
Not one day goes by, and the opening title changes again.
The sound of the police sirens points to another shootout.
Bojorquez is looking at police patrols to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under a huge portrait of a fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middleman is an eloquent slogan for the entire Sinaloe - all Riodoc employees follow his steps.
"How could we think about leaving," said Bojorquez, "when, on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
The researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first discovery of an amazing creature about the size of a rhinoceros whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called ‘Mona Lisa dinosaurs’ - found a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to determine the red brown color of his supple skin and indicated that the dinosaur had a “problem past”.
The article in Current Biology reported that it is “the most preserved so far found armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaurs in the world”.
The fossil is a new kind of Nodosauridae family. Dinosaurus lived in the period of the Cryde, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described him with the words “indeed remarkable. ”
According to National Geographic, the defensive white shark is the best preserved fossil of its species.
Behind the found, Shawn Funk discovered a fossil on March 21, 2011, drilling at the bottom of Suncor Millenium near Canada's Alberta.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to discover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After completion of the work, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
“It’s enough to make a bit of a blind eye and believe he’s asleep,” said Caleb Brown, head of the work, and the Royal Tyrrell Museum’s natural director, where the animal is exposed.
“It will certainly enter history as one of the most beautiful and preserved types of dinosaur - Mona Lisa dinosaurs. ”
By studying his skin, researchers discovered that this herbivore - although he was covered in armor and reminded the walking tank - was likely to face a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
A heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a cloaking system that uses many of today's animals.
Experts say that it allowed him to blend better in with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests that he was a popular food for larger dinosaurs.
The news of 110 million years ago by the families of Nodosauridae appeared for the first time in the newspaper in May. It is currently available to visit the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named Borealopelta markmitchelli after a museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent over 7000 hours with the team, carefully discovering fossils.
Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of the scales and armor all over the body thanks to the amazingly preserved state of fossil.
They discovered the masking method commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than the lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising because Borealopelta's size is far beyond today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was such a number of predators that evolution gave priority to masking before confrontation when surviving.
Many contemporary animals with masking - for example deer, zebra and or belter - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, indicating that rhinos had to fight for their survival literally.
“Predation of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers presented by predators during the period of chalk,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that dinosaur skin probably had red brown colouration.
The researchers continue to study the animal and search for further knowledge of its life, including the preserved contents of the stomach, to search for his last meal.
He believes that after death the dinosaur fell into the river and was taken to the sea where he sank to the bottom.
At that time, the climate was the same as in Florida and the rivers today, and the oceans went much further underground than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is indeed remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved supple skin and at the same time maintained in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as in the times of the chalk.
You don't need to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just have to make a little eye contact and it seems like he's asleep.'
During the Crying period, giant terrors, carnivorous dinosaurs, were walking on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived a few million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been the favorite prey of his appalling ancestors.
These include Acrocantosaurus, 11.5 metres long monster with a weight of over 6 tonnes.
The researchers whose latest findings were published in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta's body was washed out into the sea after it was mummified in the mud.
Behind the found, Shawn Funk discovered a fossil on March 21, 2011, drilling at the bottom of Suncor Millenium near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is in addition complete from the jaw to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
His shoulders were two-fifty centimetres.
The researchers believe that this herbivore ran the territory of today's Canada until he ended up in a river that spitting him into the sea.
His undersea tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this kind are also preserved to the extent that the armored sheets around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote the gate for National Geographic, “the finding of this preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I've been following him, the shocking it seems to me.
Fossil remains of this kind are also preserved to the extent that the armored sheets around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the drawers on his feet.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell trembled all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a native from St. Louis sat on the bed in Airbnb's room and went through Facebook contributions on her phone.
She came across a high school student's contribution.
"Police just shot a 18-year-old boy whose body is still on the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote this article to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharaah constantly retweeted her contributions to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis published on Twitter his contributions on the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, who was shot by a white-skinned cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's body, which lies helplessly on the street, from where no one took it after four hours.
"This is insane," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put off the phone to return to him the night she watched tweets about the people who gathered on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign with the inscription "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son" in his hand!
She was following live news - one of the police officers was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a clue and at his other end of the barking dog.
In another video, he held another cop, as she said, in the hand of the gun he was aiming at the crowd and he was like, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell said.
“This isn’t the kind of murder we used to call normal.
I smelled goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight immediately, and the next day she traveled home.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the City of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new document “Whose Streets?” which will be published in the cinema on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protests, love and resistance, the strength and integrity told from the perspective of people living in the community who go down the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter, dressed in a flower uniform and the same flower forehead - a topic that they have discussed many times before - “on black experience”.
"Do you remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls the conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed a 18-year-old, and that's not right."
"I did not consider taking it with me," said Ferrell later.
"Today's events are the climax... of the past.
She must have seen it with her own eyes and grown up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between different layers of black experience and what we had to do to free ourselves.
Even though I am able to provide her with conditions in which racism does not experience its own skin, it does not differ in any way from another black child-female.
I feel like if I'd protected her from this experience, I'd only hurt her."
On arrival in Ferguson, it was the first stop on South Florissant Road, across from the police department, which became the basis of activists who expected the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing for the other food.
Together, they prepared food in sachets and helped spread it to Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly born.
“My activism turned upside down after 9 August,” said Ferrell, adding that during her studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn association and sought health care and food in the black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met her co-director, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted "only to document" the current events.
But Ferrell thought: “Are you working on a document or trying to find a story that could be used?
Such a type of skepticism has penetrated the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to make money on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an indisputable interview: “We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that.”
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a well-known local artist, who deals with prisoners in the death row.
His participation in the project was also inspired by Ferrell and along with the other six local residents who followed the "Whose Streets" team in the years following the murder of Brown.
“No one speaks for us in this document, but it is our statement,” said Davis.
"That was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to show that the movement “not about the savior leader, but about bringing the community closer together,” Folayan said - it turned out that it is the most open to the participation in filming.
The document "Whose Streets?" describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell with a smile on her face thinking about the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
"I understand, however, that I must open up to do this job and to polish the blacks."
Moreover, Ferrell's story highlights the role of eccentric black women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of Teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on the social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - called themselves weird.
“Black eccentric women are ultimately behind the maintenance of the movement,” said Ferrell, “because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
However, it insists that "this is not a mere and affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main character of the document because of her views.
"She was the driving force and source of energy," she said.
"that she was in the front lines is not a coincidence, because the life at these intersections in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You can feel that energy in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, they cleared out the cameras of television stations for their position, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell's serving a two-and-a-half-year condition for blocking the freeway in demonstrations.
Socially political atmosphere in an area called home described as "the mess."
Yet, she has not remained in her efforts, which she has committed to since she set off on the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we can lose are our chains."
There was a burning field in Cologne.
Tens of firemen went to the scene, helped the helicopter as well.
Not far from České Brod in Kolínsko, between the villages of Bělny and Liblice, the field was on fire from 14:00 about 15 hectares.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, the firemen declared a third degree of fire alarm from four possible.
According to the fireman Ladislav Holomčík, he helped fire the fire from the air fire and the helicopter.
At 6 p.m., the firemen managed to put out the fire, the fire caused damage for 700,000 crowns.
With flames on the spot, dozens of professional and voluntary firemen fought.
The fire was caused by a technical defect in the engine compartment of the harvester.
Hasit also helped the helicopter, which completed a total of six drops of water.
"We gave the place of intervention to the owner until 8 p.m. tomorrow, he will be guarded by a unit of voluntary firemen," said Holomčík today.
And Becoming Reimbance: the artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery is placed just a few faces of different shades of the skin - white, black and snowy - hung from the ceiling on the wires.
All 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the mouth and hair swabs that Chelsea Manning sent her.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where an ex-analyst is serving a 35-year-old sentence for unauthorized disclosure of secret cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on 2 August, is called A Becoming Reemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines his experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transsexual and pioneer dissident whose punishment Obama reduced three days before his departure from the post of president of the United States.
The algorithmic DNA analysis of Manning and the use of 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would have created Dewey-Hagborg's shrewd, if not an intellectual commentary on the subjectivity of DNA - as well as many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and unthinkable determination of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, had already talked about being a woman since she was a young woman, was sentenced in 2013 on the basis of 20 prosecutions, including six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photos were held by prison staff. Only one black and white picture of the lower quality that Manning, obviously concerned, was sitting on the driver's seat in a platinum blonde wig with which she is now connected.
In 2015, positive responses to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012 Stranger Visions continued.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette and chewing pads - to create a picture of the possible shapes of these people.
And at that time, she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait,” explained Dewey-Hagborg on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visitors and photography were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea asking if she was interested in DNA portraits.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoila Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was pardoned and could take part in the exhibition in person.
Indeed, President Obama, a few days after the release of the comic book, asked for the release of Manning, which was a welcome change after several years in the military prison in Kansas.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is at war with people who are trying to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to stimulate hatred in areas that he should support.
In response to the question concerning this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that “all things are happening for a reason.”
Under a statement from an artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with his huge signature (the letter "i" in the last name is embossed by the heart) after the end of "self-employed fracilition, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the other hand, there are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - the C, G and A stem recorded in pencil.
By classification of 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
"I hope that people will take away from it that our genome does not matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way," said Dewey-Hagborg. Her work Spurious Memories from 2007 on video theme is also visible.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic amendment.
It shows Manning how King Kong's way of emerging from the United States Disiplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
“When he prevents you from speaking, he will win,” says he.
"You should never be silenced."
“It is a direct transcript from one of the letters,” the Philippian artist said.
"When I think about it, my skin is creeping."
Manning hasn't personally visited the exhibition - which was foretold in the comic book - but when it does, she will be welcomed in the center of the room by her masks, own genomic similarities, sorted as a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including almost 160 cm high statue of Maning, on which by pencil its genetic haplogroup are recorded.
“In the past, they were placed on walls, but this time I wanted them to feel the crowd,” said Dewey-Hagborg about portraits.
"I wanted to impress the mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and liberates it."
Professor of the Northwest University and the Oxford University employee wanted for murder
On these days, a national search for professor of the Northwest University is ongoing, and employees of Oxford University, who are being prosecuted for the suspicion of murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, were reported by police.
On Monday, a first-degree warrant was issued for the murder of a man named Wyndham Lath (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, states Cook County's file.
The paper says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
The Chicago Police declared that the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
Police officers were alerted by telephone. On arrival in Grand Plaza Apartments they found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead in the scene, and detectives are investigating a murder case.
Lathem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of the University of Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was prohibited from entering the school premises of the University.
“The whole matter is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the University of the North West is fully cooperating with them,” said Cubbage.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
The university spokesperson and Somerville College stated in an e-mail address: “The British police have contacted us and we are ready to assist the American police as well.”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues have been shocked and wish to apply to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, Head of Public Relations of the Chicago Police Department, said he called on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"The police have information on their whereabouts and the search for suspects is increasing," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national police are helping the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events in apartment 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on 27 July.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
“We believe Professor Latham knew his victim,” said Guglielmi.
Grand Plaza has issued a statement for all residents: “Police is now working on drawing up a time review and profile of the victim and investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In the near future, we will complete the WADA's plan" - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mutko
Vice-President of the Russian Government, Vitaly Mutko said that it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
‘A part of the criteria for the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan was updated," said Mutko on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the Organisation's website.
According to Mutek, the code contains nothing that should concern Russia.
“All things have been notified and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA soon," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned above calls for the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, of alleged sponsoring of the Russian athletes' doping by the government.
Mutko said: “We are investigating because our anti-doping system has apparently failed.
It was taken to take all measures.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot admit something that never existed."
Mutkova’s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview for the Russian RSport Smirnov admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, he added: “We have said on many occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to receive the report without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of carrying out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UKAD this June.
Following a visit to the Moscow headquarters of the organization in July, General Director WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "on the right path" for renewal.
The police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police charged three men with setting up a center fire for a rare wooden church in Třinci-Gutech on Frýdecko-Místeck.
One accused is juvenile, all three are Czech nationalities.
They've been in prison for up to 15 years for a crime of general threat.
The reporters today told Moravsko-Silesian police director Tomáš Kužel.
According to him, it was a intentional crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the theme of the whole matter," Kužel said.
He said that the police would be dealing with possible arrests of those charged with custody.
Further information according to the Director cannot be disclosed.
"I can't tell you anything yet, because the criminal police staff are actually working on matters, and the investigation and the prosecutor who's overseeing the matter," Kžel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech came from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage is expected to go to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is innumerable.
The beginnings of the fire have begun to reflect on the restoration of the church.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, additional costs are prepared to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and City, public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish.
A similar wooden church of holy Kateřina from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by electrical failure.
A precise copy was made in his place.
The state is counting on citizens to defend the state.
They'll support their training.
With financial support for associations which can be used in the defence of the state, voluntary shooting training or with a team of trainers, the law on the preparedness of citizens to defend the state counts in substance.
The Ministry of Defence, which was given a task from the government, promises that it will be possible to increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
It comes from a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law was adopted in the future, the State would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the objectivity.
The main aim of the proposal is, according to his authors, to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the Czech people to defend the state, outside the performance of the obligation taken and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the State would, financially or materially, support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would increase the ability of their members.
In return, he would obtain data on people who are willing, if necessary, to come to the country at a time of crisis to help and on their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other stakeholders in training or training.
It also counts on organizing a session with war veterans or people who have acted heroicly.
One possible variant assumes that a new office should be established to manage the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasise that participation of people should be voluntary and the state would use their abilities only after the announcement of the state of emergency.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual destruction of pre-obvious borders between different types of threats," states the intention of referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials have noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of abilities, not just military ones.
"The basic aim of the plan is to create a very wide base that enables each citizen to respond in a qualified manner to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the Czech Republic's state or lives, health and property, to protect himself, or to contribute to the protection of others, and to the wrong behavior of not burdening the performance of tasks by the armed forces of the Czech Republic," he says.
The adoption of the law would bring little financial claims.
According to the Ministry, their height will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million a year.
More money would go to pay or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that it would have to extend the scope of regional military command to employ 42 more soldiers together.
Ministers have already stated that the law should also help resolve some Czech politicians' disagreement with the implementation of the European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its acceptance would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons that the directive requires.
Startups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but she didn't find a suitable survey.
The answers were often imprecise, useless, or even deceptive.
And even though she promised anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their mistrust in the whole process.
"I looked for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of an e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, employing 75 people.
So she asked for help from the outside.
New startups from the human resources sector are constantly emerging on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with a specific intention of measuring employees' responsibilities, companies allow companies to make quick votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offers complete anonymity of employees and a hot line of complaints, and in some cases they also allow informants to go around and contact the director directly.
"There are tools on the market such as the Strava and Fitbit that follow your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Glint startup, based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that, in three years' time, Glint gained greater awareness of what her employees thought and what they felt.
In addition to quick surveys and votes of specific teams, Glint offers a company's temperature map and a regular overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low ratings - which allows the user to work on the axle.
The companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to care for the culture of the working environment - in case they become another Uber - which is thrown away in scandals after the former employee published a contribution to his blog describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups such as Glint, the demand for surveys of corporate culture represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector by 2020 can exceed $118.8 billion.
Explosion Converter from Denver, Colorado, who helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a slight increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Almost 600 Converter clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He recently accepted Uber under his wings.
Like Glint, the Converter allows companies to send customised flash surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints shall be sent directly to the Governing Board.
“The Court of Justice has authorised regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Converter startup.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment with its employees or non-ethical behavior - and if regulators do not act - it may face costly consequences due to the boycott of customers, the exhaustion of employees or judicial proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday network employs more than 25,000 people across 500 locations, using Converter for more than a year to raise the awareness of corporate principles and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Before that, if the employee wanted to report any problems, he had to track the phone number or e-mail to the management of the company, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a horrifying and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Deputy General Ruby Tuesday, who previously did not have a reliable way of monitoring employee complaints.
Now that the company is using the Converter, it is ensured that there is rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never previously gone to managers sitting in offices, miles away from the actual solution to complaints - for example, discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
“This is coming to a holistic overall view of the experience of employees,” said Vitrano, who is managing Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from legal disputes by employees."
The companies stopped taking the ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after Arthur Andersen’s accountants collapsed after Enron’s collapse in the case of the abuse of the ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But only when “the social media lit the whole thing” began to realize that in the online world they could not simply hide their skeletons in a closet.
"Before people started using ethics to follow, they relied on faith," added Quinlan.
Glint and Converter offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by bold capital investors who supported both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Converter chose $10 million in total from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and eventually he took the capital of $47 million.
Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and received $60 million during the entire campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more than ever from their workplace.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to believe that they are received and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that seeks a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they seek the success of society,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefit and employee benefits of LinkedIn, which uses Converter and Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies are successful if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure the commitment and commitment of employees to the company, it is no wonder that there are many investors who will support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have staff satisfaction data.
But the data itself is impeccable unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is, once the company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if change does not happen quickly - in the worst case ever - it may cause disappointment and disinterest of employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4,000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who witnessed many companies that were too relying on data alone.
“ Because once things are not done, employees start asking themselves: ‘ Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'"
Madison Reed, now regularly conducting a survey between employees every month, is able to solve the problem through Glint within one day, said Errett.
After the assembly of feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision making and communication quality, Errett was able to reorganise several teams within the company and start training communication for a successful solution to the problem.
Ruby Tuesday receives a very important view of its employees and hopes that in the long run it will achieve high employment in the field known to be frequent redundancies.
"If you do not seek a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," said Vitrano.
"And as soon as you lose your employees, you lose your customers.
And the whole company is going to fail with the customer drain."
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in Hodonínska so far the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
So he overcome Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The employees of the Czech hydrometheorological Institute informed about this.
Unlike Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records.
Vedra hit Moravia mainly, in Bohemia was mainly clouded.
On Tuesdays, records to 35 out of 145 meteorological stations, measured over 30 years, were overtaken.
Only nine long-term measuring stations recorded the record on Thursday.
For example, in Strážnice, today's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice in Břeclavsk today 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degree exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records came from 2013 as well as Strážnice.
The high temperatures appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the biggest heat in Dyákovice was in Znojemsko and Brod nad Dyja in Břeclav, where mercury reached 37.8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the other hand, according to the Czech Republic website, only around 22 degrees Fahrenheit were the highest temperatures today.
"Temperatures began to grow there later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heats in the Czech Republic will gradually come back and more significant rains may come on Sunday.
Most of the places in Moravia remain high temperatures still on Friday and south-east Moravia on Saturday.
We've got such a clumsy going on here.
The billions are not enough for the same vote in elections as for each full - aged man in the country.
They want to make direct decisions, and because not all of them are as rude as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of the Penty Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues, is sponsoring Robejškovy Realista under the water of Martin Burdou and Antonín Fryč.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the entrepreneur in real estate, Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
The convicted corrupter and King of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta purchased the Private People's Party.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project Andreje Babiš did not necessarily name the Mayor of Krořížský, Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter for itself.
The Mayors have also been caught recently by their billionaires.
It's Dalibor Grandpa, the owner of the company on the Jablotron security facility.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
The entrée in the mayor's uniform didn't do much for Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
That means that my goal is to keep the Ana movement 20 percent of the Mayor's movement in the election.
Leckdo smiled.
The grandfather's resolution is rather symptomatic.
Billionary Dalibor Grandpa is a man of firm opinion.
Although he intends to apply for votes in the Mayor's uniform, he continues to support Andrei Babiš.
My grandfather supported Babiš in past parliamentary elections.
"Babish is not a shot-up speaker and does not rule by the kissing rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
He certainly doesn't go into politics because he wants to make himself better.
For me, Babiš will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his own world, under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he knew from his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn how to cooperate with Babiš.
Some may appreciate the fact that Grandpa does not change his views and stands behind him no matter what uniform he wears.
Others can speculate whether Babiš sends someone so clumsy to the Mayors.
Others may ask if the boss of Jablotron, for example, did not break up with the boss of Agrofert in an evil shop and does not seek another way to defend his business rival.
The first public performance of Grandpa was not just about Babiš.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard to put a stop to such a statement.
After all, the court-recognited Gauner Zdeněk Bakala was throwing millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the Security Agency of Víta Barty, TOP 09 and the citizens' Democrats came together for nearly thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits any political party from giving more than three million.
When Grandpa enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe he wouldn't have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation.
My first days in politics, Grandpa crowned with a proposal for tax advantages for families with studied children.
People with higher education come to our house for about 50,000 a month.
Those with the basics on less than 20.
A man with fifty thousand is rich here.
The one with the 20 poor.
In the Grandpa’s vision of society, the poor pay honestly their taxes and the rich enjoy the benefits of a social state that they do not participate in.
The rich need simply help to avoid poverty.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition, and Grandma can wash her hands.
The rest of us thanks to Grandpa, we can confirm that billionaires aren't good people.
Then there's the question of who to vote.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not hold members and members of their party, citizens and citizens of the State as employees and the country for their property.
Finally, those who want to live well in a rich land for all people, not just for some.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to lower by 234 million.
Sometimes selling real estate isn't easy.
And it often doesn't help 11 bedrooms, a wonderful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is sold by President Donald Trump.
At the time of the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down on the incredible 8 million pounds.
Mirror.co.uk informed about this.
The brochure says, "Hi, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to the scene like no other.
But neither the connection between the real estate company and the US president has been extremely priced.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean mansion by an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex stands as about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's no wonder.
The stunning 5 acres on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The area includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of palms planted on the property.
There is a beautiful view of the sea from the terrace.
According to real estate experts, the fact that the connection with the President is not sufficient to attract potential buyers has proved to be priced.
Now the property is closer to the normal prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought real estate in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about £15 million.
The property was supposed to be bought for rent purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
But with a new price, he's in second place.
The property in the neighborhood was awarded at £ 13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to quit two trainings a day.
The 11th morning, and UCLA U.S.A. football players are at the side of the new school course.
Some of them take off their uniforms and expose sweaty backs, unfamiliar sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most of the team members of these few minutes, nothing works out for the midday break.
Players registered in the summer semester will go to the rooms after three hours of training to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the next morning at 6:30.
"These boys will be a real big one for the next three days," said Coach Bruins Jim Mora shortly before Monday's swinging on Tuesday.
By eliminating two trainings in one day NCAA wants to lighten up players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exam is finished.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 19:15 - to stick themselves in the already sleeping diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora spent as a coach in Westwood, Bruins training camp begins a week earlier than last year and trainings are limited during the summer semester.
A total of 18 trainings are planned until 20 August, starting with formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team in September.
Mora had heard that he supported the NCAA's decision, although he added another item to the already loaded players' schedule.
“Three or four days are players under great stress and it is very exhausting for them,” Mora said.
"But nobody gave up, everyone's trying, they're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
The UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy to see the bright lines of surrounding lands from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury Luskin Center Hotel, which has occupied players after harvesting the security net behind the goal bars.
Players of Bruins should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that once the rooms have been emptied during the season, there might be a problem.
"The land will be patrolling the security service," Mora said.
“The security is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
That's the kind of material he deals well with.
Fortunately, the hotel will guard security as well as parking lot No 8.
We'll use our maximum resources.
I believe everything will be fine.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans more thorough control of facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control third parties and display findings under the original contributions in an effort to fight against so-called "fake news", said the biggest social network on Thursday.
The company in the statement on its website writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible Hoaxes that will send third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook was referred to as one of the main sources of false reports, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year's election of the President of the United States.
Political debates are taking place in Europe. French voters are flooded with false reports on May presidential elections, and Germany is planning to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September elections if it does not quickly eliminate angry contributions.
On Thursday, in his further statement published in Germany, Facebook stated that it was planning to launch testing of the new function of checking false reports in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying messages verified by third parties, people are asking for more content to be better informed and to be able to make the right decision on what they can share,” she said on her blog Sara Su, Facebook news manager.
It added that Facebook continues to test the function of “related articles” and also works on other changes in order to reduce the number of false messages.
Create graphic novels: A Castle in England
The small castle Scotland Castle has recently played its main role in the music video of the group Squeeze, and Margaret Thatcher has also found her refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
Scottney, however, was from his cozy place near the Bewl River in Kent, England, a witness of 700 years of stormy history, inspired by the curly Jamie Rhodes of York County, known as an interest in historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"I am fascinated by the look at the writing of a man who is 300 years after his death," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived at the Castle of Scotland from the Middle Ages until the Eduardian period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But it is not the first book of Rhodes inspired archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stores (2014), a collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
“I was interested in a print on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for Jacobite,” he said.
“It’s a fingerprint of his fingers!
And the letters always smell like smoke because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
If I smell a note now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility to live almost four months at the castle almost as a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and bottles that have been dumped for centuries in the ditch.
He was walking around the grounds and researching the ruins of the old castle, talking to the rotten, gardeners and sometimes artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night, he was "drinking whiskey and writing".
The trusted history of Scotland is a relatively large unknown one, as National Trust gained access to documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the workers began to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words, as if “the aristocracy of many centuries were spreading their hands with the words: ‘Put it into the attic’.
Journals, letters from the British Empire, maps showing the property: “Maybe you think the land dispute is boring,” said Rhodes, “but I came across one case when two families were dragging over the birch.
Stop it, people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge and are more deep into English history, including the story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of the rebellion at the castle in 1380, which was in the book called Knightly Familys of Kent and Sussex," said Rhodes.
“In fact, the English rebellion began in this area and I thought that rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe he's related in the end."
The other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest whose family had been hiding Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about a 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled a stone coffin (which was discovered several years after the discovery of the coffin).
Rhodes’ favorite family is Darrell’s: “I was intrigued by the male generation - then men were always in debt and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
Different generations of Darrell families have dealt with this by marrying rich or old ladies - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to be heirs."
With the end of his stay at the castle Rhodes is looking for other adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week routine in the Finnish wilderness, where he was inspiring for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said to myself, 'Now I'm going to get the hell back to real life'."
Washington changes the terms of the green card award
The media has published the words of President Donald Trump on a new U.S. immigration plan, which will also change in the green card award.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 each year as a result of more stringent rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be presented to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we will achieve this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will favor the English-speaking applicants, who flow funds and demonstrate the skills that will benefit our country," said Trump, quoted by the media.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just as it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, there will be a report on the Internet on the technological development of sex robots.
Yes.
Sexual robots are really popular these days.
Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) has recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots over the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder Noel Sharpey, it is necessary to look seriously at the rise of sex robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot nails.
"People make fun of them, but sales are growing and we must be prepared to see them more and more," Sharkey said on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable master to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm at the touch - the obvious is artificial intelligence that mimics the behavior of man.
The user can "adjust" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it is very worrying that many robots have their own "personality" that would shame even the Stepford lady.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the robot RealBotix can set up his replacement wife various character features, including shyness.
And then there's the sex robot woman Roxxxy Gold of True Companion, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by the shy nature and "divoid Wendy" with a "adult" nature.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality is set to suit your personality as far as possible," writes True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
It may be tired, callable or “in the mood”.
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for several reasons - among which is the exchange for real interhuman relationships. The rather worrying are the submissive female character features and violent insinuations - e.g. frigid (a countering) Farrah.
The True Companion company, on its website, is like Roxxxy to a man's vibrator.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why couldn't she have a man named Roxxxy?" writes on the page.
Sexual robots, however, are not just fetishes or sexual aids.
Their formation and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a distance from ideal or sexual equality towards desire for submissive sex with an optional edge.
Most men, of course, don't buy a robot woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still stay at the edge of the interest of the general public.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set today.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they have an excuse for the free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world acquire their rights and in the White House are sitting the president, who is often very shameful at the address of a woman.
The most horrific aspect of the story of the story of the servant is not what we see - hanged bodies and plucked eyes, rather the reality of these visions.
The story of a servant is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots are to be as much like the real women as possible (including porno actresses).
Their creators design them to be pleasant to the touch and act as a real woman at first sight.
But when it comes to their "personality," the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would encourage their independence or disrupt their devotion to their master.
In other words, they're nice slaves.
They say 21st century: maids.
The NBA star on the green armpit.
Curry fights for cut in California.
The star basketball player Stephen Curry hasn't lost himself in the opening of the premiere between professional golfers, despite the failed first hit.
A double winner of the NBA's most useful player played the Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour in the California Hayward first round for 74 shots and will fight for cut.
The Golden State player, who won second title with the Warriors team in NBA this season, began very nervously and his first hit ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate among the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four wounds over the steam.
"It was not the ideal way to start, it was necessary to call the referee right after the first strike, but then it was a bit of a saddle," Curry said with the fact that he was hit by a huge treble.
It was very nervous to blow up the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I hoped for.
"If you'd told me I'd be playing 74 in the first round, I'd have taken it right away," he said.
If Curry manages to fight with the cut, which will probably be set two shots under the steam, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so at Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the trems, I hope it will," said an enthusiastic golfer, who has already played celebrities and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
Hayward is the first to start a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsor's exception and maintained his amateur status.
The Web.com series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Against that, Mitt Romney is an embodiment of common sense.
The unfamiliar symbol of Trump’s era becomes the political strife that divides the US voters, and they also break down the entire families on a micro scale.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers used advice on how to deal with relatives who chose Trump.
Allegedly, we're just waiting for our nerves to come up.
However, a little less attention is devoted to Trump’s family’s ability to stutter.
I'm talking about it because this week my cousin, a poet and a Left fan who lives in Chicago, visited me in New York for a long time, paid for a Republican fool in our family.
She reminded me that the suspense in the face of a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden, the whole family - including all the Republican siblings with whom it has been bickering about politics for years - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but I'm concerned that it poses a significant risk in the wider context.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to force us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the horrifying possibility that his playwrights might one day lose to attractiveness.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans, who, contrary to its standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these times with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy act - the dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (at least we had the awareness of his tax return) - both of which look very mild compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it's enough to make the subsequent Republican candidate at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visits and took the children to Central Park for the biggest carousel that runs the New York Park Department - for your three dollars you won't find better use if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the middle cylinder is covered with glass - clowns and animals are filming and looking at their own shoulders in horror - a very dark view and the tinky music is strangely resembling public transport.
Many clichés are about to freeze: the view from the tall buildings, the panorama looks at you instead of breathing the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty years later, I still didn't get over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't really Swiss cheese - it doesn't count the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the subway station in London.
Nevertheless, the collage in Central Park brings about a remarkable magical experience, to the extent that two two years old children like two mature women are having a great time.
If I could evaluate the carousel, he would have earned maximum points, but fortunately no one asks.
This week, I had a similar experience in the store when I was asked to evaluate my experience on a scale from one to five when paying a credit card.
It's the same at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, except I can throw a 15% tip for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down the sale of fast, but the waitress is forced to get into the goods of the buyers when there is no need.
The woman in the store apologized to me when I was reluctant to evaluate my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistoris was transferred from prison to the hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistoris had to be transferred to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cutting wounds on his wrist, which, according to the prisoner's statement, caused himself after the fall in the cell.
Pistoris was convicted of murder after appeal against the original murder sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early morning on Valentine's Day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of the toilet closet in his Pretoria.
Pistorius said he mistook her for a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to recommence, this time against the six-year sentence of the Pistorius, which, according to their words, is too mild.
National Prosecating Authority stated that it would refer to South Africa's Supreme Court this year.
In case of success, Pistoris is threatened to extend his sentence to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a baby in captivity to a bred panda that was burning in the wild.
It's a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the genotype of the captive pandas.
The Č-chung centre worker told the agency New China that the panda breeding is at risk of a major risk of related crossovers.
At the end of last year, only 471 pandas lived in captivity.
There are only two thousand of them in the wild.
The attempt to let the captured pandas with the wild ones be saved is so the first step in helping to keep the panda safe.
The 15-year-old Cchao-cchao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of a panda mating period on 11 March.
Thanks to the neck tracking device, scientists could observe every step of it.
She met her chosen Cchao-cchao 12 days later.
Sex with a panda male lasted a minute and a half, and it was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lover of the animal realm.
Males rather misjudge the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The youth was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed after the birth of 216 grams.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, quoted BTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were arrested on 1 August in the morning hours of the Sithonian police.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated to the BTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and imposed strict fines on anyone who is caught in a place where no camping is permitted.
The checks will take place all season.
The Ministry has stated that the court may impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klara Spilka is the first major British Open in 50th place.
The playing field in the Kingsbarns of Scotland went round one shot under the pair when she played three Birdies and twice the Bogey.
Twenty-year-old Czech player has the hope that for the first time he will pass through the famous major.
Entering the $3.25 million grant contest came out best from the American star Michelle Wieová, who won the first round in the record of 64 shots, which is eight below the pairs.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands download millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry establishments due to the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Supervisory Authority of NVWA announced that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry establishments, which, according to it, means that 80 percent of eggs on the market are harmless.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of types of eggs identifiable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substances in eggs is small and does not pose a potential threat to children for adults.
Czech speaker Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined the closing of breeding, have not recently imported into the Czech Republic.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets problem signs of insecticide have appeared.
According to the veterinary administration in the Czech market, eggs from Belgium were last in April and eggs from the Netherlands in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a quantity of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of the products against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, they must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to feeling sick and dizzy.
Riga is beautiful, I'll miss her, says goalie Sedláček, looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"I'm going back there one day," smiled with a 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in a Zlín uniform.
Depends on whether he gets his engagements by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you experienced in Latvia?
If I were to judge it as at school, it would be three.
The first year I didn't catch much, I had an experienced goalie in front of me.
I've been studying.
The second year I started to catch.
Before the third season, I thought they were gonna give me more space.
But they brought a new goalie with whom I changed.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch it all the time.
But during the initial ten matches, we only scored five points, so the trainers started to spin.
In the end, my colleague was getting more caught.
But that's how you do it.
They wanted to play it next season.
How was your life in Riza?
Beautiful.
It's small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're three years together, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slavan who have to change their game style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more back, more fighting.
I didn't see a problem in the field width.
The difference is, the Russians want to play in the blank.
Less shoots, and even if they have half an empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There's more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem with traveling and moving through seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
She can sleep peacefully.
The program is usually made so that you play like four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians even notice their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia is watching hockey, and with basketball, it's a national sport.
Everybody's a fan.
Even though it didn't work, there were a lot of people walking.
Did Dinam’s work in the KHL help to make almost a quarter-final move to Latvia at this year’s World Cup?
KHL has been playing since 2008, and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since the same time, their results at the World Cup began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi they fell in the quarter-final with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading for the Czech extraliga.
In Zlin, Roberts Bukarts got up and before signing the contract, Ralfs Freibergs.
Why do so many come here?
They're no beech players, they're really good.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, the Latvians are among them.
It's a natural course.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still without engagement?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't go on with Riza.
That's when we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was classic.
We've been talking to different teams, but they've decided in the finals for someone else.
So I train at home in Zlin and I'll wait for something to show up.
Aren't you nervous about this?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was gonna happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am at home after some time.
I got something in the KHL, so I'm not taking it anymore.
The question is, when and where do I sign?
How real is the way you're going to start a new year in Zlin?
Anything can happen.
Let's see what happens next month, where things come up.
Now all I can do is wait for the agent to make a deal.
Do you prefer any competition?
The past season wasn't enough for me to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's flight continues.
In January this year, I wrote about the camp in Lety near Orlík in an article.
The substance of the problem remains the same, and so I will allow myself to remind the fundamental passage of the article.
We've been talking about camp in Lety for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what this is about, it is probably best to look at e.g. the official pages of the Pietní place Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, they will know that the camp was two kilometres east of Lety, that from 8.8. 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1. 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2.8. 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first prisoners were enrolled in Auschwitzan transport.
4.5. 1943 The largest transport to the extermination camp was transported 370 persons.
The total was 420.
A very sad history of the enormous sufferings of human beings that caused them human beings again and degenerate ideology.
There is no dispute that these events must be kept in mind.
There is no dispute that this reminder should take place in the memorial in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
The camp was somewhat forgotten in socialism and in the 1970s it was close to and built on parts of the former camp veřín.
The history of the camp accidentally discovered by the American Paul Polansky in 1992, a memorial was revealed in Lety in 1995.
In the mid - 1990 ’ s, the government promised to buy and tear down the farm, but it has not yet happened.
In 1998 the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration under the Lidice Memorial falls.
In July 2013, he called on the UN Human Rights Committee of the Czech Republic to close the venison.
So much very brief facts about the postwar fate of the camp.
Until last fall, the government approved the slaughter of the pig and decided to draw up an expert assessment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pig.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman, "there are some numbers, but I'd probably waste those intentions if I went public with them."
Let's see what a professional assessment will bring.
According to some unofficial estimates, it could be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price could reach a billion.
Either way, it's not gonna be cheap.
And yet, just a few hundred meters from the former camp, there is a memorial, which in 2010 the state invested almost ten million crowns.
Even if the entire transaction were to be financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is probably not a threat, I think it would be just as much throwing money away.
Doesn't the government have any other priorities?
A memorial, a dignified spot, stands in the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of a tragedy that has been done and anyone that wants can bow down to the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change that!
Let us keep it as it is, and keep the tender place with maximum care.
A responsible person, in this case the Czech Government of the Czech Republic, should treat the care of a proper householder for the transferred property, i.e. the money of taxpayers.
At least with the same as your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Vice-President of the Government is not the whole government.
But I still see from the perspective of the above-mentioned facts the password of the leader of the movement NO just as an empty election proclamation.
This May I went straight to the spot.
Very nice driveway, adjusted parking lot, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exhibition, in the second integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own petting spot, which is created from stones located in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and garlands.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as it looks and belongs.
Currently, archaeological research is taking place at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, some of the discovered foundations could not be preserved and, in an appropriate way, at least visually accessible.
In this direction, Minister Daniel Herman could tension his efforts.
In the event that he manages to enforce the slaughter of the pig for state money in the government, it will only be another unfortunate step in his already sufficiently problematic action as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and milk products can be a nightmare.
However, the new study suggests the opposite: diet rich in animal proteins and dairy products could help to relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incurable disease affecting up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 UK patients causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat or milk products to relieve the symptoms. However, Washington University researchers have found that the essential amino acid of tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support bowel resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells protect the intestines and ensure that harmful microbes are removed from the food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
Once the bowls of scales are facing inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
Within the research, scientists discovered the presence of immune cells that promote the tolerance of the body in the stomach by mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the formation of cells of the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a connection between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the intestinal microbiom and the development of cells that support the tolerance of the body.
The more tryptophan they had mice in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuteri and diet rich in tryptophan would help develop a more bearable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in a study of a certain type of immune cells that support body tolerance, discovered that one group of mouse tested had these cells, while the other group of same mice kept separately.
It derived from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiom - a community of bacteria, viruses and molds that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
Mouse tuber was tested by DNA sorting and researchers found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells that lacked a second group of mice.
The mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked an intestinal microbiom - so they did not develop this kind of immune cell - were given L. reuteri bacteria - and formed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to non-developed immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immunity cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the fluid, it appeared to be the by-product of a tripthophane metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the triptophane by-products of L. reuteri cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but the defects in tryptophan-related genes have been detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Every one of us should probably try to develop these cells because they control inflammation of the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the population of cells."
José Mourinho considers the signing of a contract with Nemanje Matić and his transfer to Manchester United as “genial”
Manchester United won the "genia" team in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the backupr debuted in the Wednesday fight against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed the 40 million pounds contract, introduced himself in the first win at 2:1 in Dublin - the last fore-end match against the UEFA Super Cup, where the United will meet with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira in his role as backupr.
However, since he did not participate in the team's pre-term Asian tour, Matić did not have a form and only played 45 minutes on which, according to the words of Mourinha, he was able to work the next Premier League season before the start of the next season.
"He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent, and has brilliant thinking - thinking football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him get into shape as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romela Lukaku also played their first game at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho, he is slowly forming his 11th for the next season.
An independent source this week announced that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with the other three players, but insists that the club has done a “fantastic work” and has brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you for helping me win three out of four players," he added.
"Four out of four would have pleased me more, but I admit they've done the best for me."
The Life Challenge of the King of Chicken Skins Ladi Peas.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promity picture began to come up with a new TV show Prima Zdeňkova akademie.
The pea immediately lit up the chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to sign up for your cooking academy because I think I can learn a lot from you," he called on his social networking video.
And since these two have been tipping around for several years, he hasn't forgotten to turn his back on Lada this time.
"In return, I can teach you from dietary chicken, American cucumbers, or invite you to water and show you why it's a favorite fried cheese," said Hrushka.
He's serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss said," he said to the Lightning.
But he did not express himself because he filmed new parts of his next show Yes, boss!.
Only Prima responded to Hruška's participation in the culinary Academy, with the fact that the whole matter is taking as his personal activity that goes beyond television.
Hrushka Pohlreich planted a big blow to his first cook in December 2004.
She sold over 300 thousand pieces in a few days!
The new programme, presented yesterday by Prima at a press conference on the autumn broadcast scheme, is a non-false cooking school.
He selects his pupils from the audience, and in twelve parts he will introduce them with twelve cooking techniques.
In the last episode of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk had his shirt on his back ironed with a sliced pear.
If my face was there, I'd laugh a lot.
"Upon the pear with only a smile - pear is healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Laďa responded.
Laď's culinary art is what he thinks.
"Cooking according to Ladi Hruška is not even in the house, because I don't want to go home with a gastropunk," has a clear boss.
Zdenek Pohlreich is very much appreciated, even according to him I make chicken on honey.
On my show, however, his recipes will certainly not appear," he did not forgive the Peas.
He's an asshole!
He's no cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic illiterate or idiot," said Pohlreich about Hrušek at one lecture.
"I don't have 20 to be able to wave my hands over them, but I don't care about them anymore," said Hrushek on the account of the said insults.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house by wavering
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip in the body. With a simple wave of hand, he can unlock the door from home and office and even start the car.
Steven Northam, a 32-year-old, had a tiny chip implanted between the thumb and the index finger, and is currently offering the same service through its company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make life easier by using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital, Winchester, oversees the implantation and follow-up procedure.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted to dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service to exchange door and car locks, compatible with microchip. The price of one castle is 300 £.
The married father of one child had the technology integrated into his home and his car brand BMW Z4, which will start with a simple wave of hands.
White House receipts cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision to fly in with the Navy helicopter to South Lawn on the occasion of the American manufacturing industry's celebration last month came according to the Navy's records of the TIME weekly, for $24,000.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the peak of the program on July 17 at the White House, which was a show of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials were watching a show of products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter from Connecticut was exposed next to a Maine yacht, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, requesting the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours prior to the landing of a helicopter on South Lawn as part of an emergency, reported the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the administration of the helicopter.
“I wanted to make sure that you were aware of such an important event,” wrote Commander HMX-1 in his superior’s e-mail address, naval commander’s representatives the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 on the occasion of the show, the beginning of which is scheduled at 15:00 and will remain on site until the full location was cleared, which was scheduled between 18:00 and 21:00.
It was further in the e-mail that if there was a delay on departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for return flights due to the Working Time Regulation.
The original crew remained on the scene that night, together with the helicopter, and along with them also a unit of security personnel.
From the records - which was received by TIME - it was not visible if the second crew was sent in the end.
Hatch Act prevents state officials from using government assets for political purposes.
The records suggest that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
“We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was fine,” the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're being blocked," wrote the deputy commander.
This show "Made in America" was designated the White House as an official event, and so Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the events, the president advocated a health reform that was going through the Senate and talked about trying to keep the government under control.
The use of air means such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents use them to travel.
However, their presence is purely due to presentation is unusual.
Trump ordered control in February after the presidential plane was driven in the background at his first meeting in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is filled with complaints about the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft.
“The White House is pleased by the show “Made in America”, which presented products from all 50 countries produced by Americans from American materials,” said the press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in Washington and South Lawn and train possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit at the beginning of July in Germany, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the show Made in America was part of the current training of the crew, provided by the State Agent.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew into the "non-presidency support missions" for another 11 hours.
The White House stated that no other props were paid out of taxpayers' money.
spokesperson Sikorsky stated that the company was not in any way interested in the negotiations for the exhibition of a helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights and the exact cost of the show is difficult to identify according to the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017 is, compensation for DoD expenditure for VH-3D 24 380 $ per flight hour.
Unit records indicate the time 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are well below that amount.
"The costs of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenditure are very misleading," Walters said.
‘These estimates shall include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual costs.’
According to the 2015 RAND study, compensation for DoD expenditure does not cover staff costs but includes fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The White House press secretary Sean Spicer was defending the use of a helicopter for the purpose of the show.
“Idea shows this week are presented by products produced in the USA,” said Spicer.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to the defence of our state, and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military facilities whose production involves countless American citizens.
This fact is to be recalled."
It is not clear if Trump was also looking at the helicopter during his tour of South Lawn. It is clear only that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House Trump approached Sikorsky's representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I own three myself."
A young woman got stuck in a swamp near Máchovo Lake, and the police were sneaking up on her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday about around 2:00 in the morning.
Instead of swimming, she stayed trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to use her cell phone to help a cop, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For this reason, police officers soon lost contact with her," said police spokesperson Ivana Baláková.
Several police patrols set out to find a young woman that she described about, but it was not easy to find.
"Some of the police officers had to walk hundreds of meters of reeds before they felt land under their feet," Balák said.
And so she was missing.
The police were determined by the direction in which her call for help was based.
"To avoid losing this connection, they agreed with her that she would be counting out loud," the spokesman said.
Police officers found a woman up to three quarters of five in the swamps in the Borný locality.
She was on the verge of both physical and mental forces and she was showing signs of hypothermia.
That's why an ambulance sent her to a Czech hospital.
The connection of Grandpa to the STAN?
The requested bride becomes a sales girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project looking for alusive.cz, it was like a billionaire told voters that STAN was suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also pretended that a politically incoherent group of less well-known mayors and independents doesn't actually have a national programme for the House elections.
Her electoral candidate will simply become a decent person after interviewing Grandpa, no matter what his political opinion.
He used to start that way with Vít Bart, and it didn't turn out very well.
In addition, Grandpa also disturbs the STAN's favorite argument that the greatest value of the movement is political examination and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, even according to surveys.
Now, they're replacing the quick-taken unknown personalities.
Total dissolution with the people, after which STAN changed the logo and the slogan, Gazdík explained also by the fact that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if STAN was suspicious of identity by then few people, after Grandpa's arrival, the game of identity ends.
Not only did Gazdík have long been defining himself against YES Andrej Babiš, but Grandpa, who publicly praises Babiš, said as follows: "My goal is to get the Yes movement, that is, the Mayor's movement in the upcoming elections will win 20 percent."
Let's hope he didn't confuse the movement.
Grandpa's a successful businessman, and I'm sure a billionaire isn't a coincidence.
He often talks about politics like Babiš, but unlike him, he does not have his own political mark.
For a while, STAN has been resembling reality shows rather than the real political party and Grandpa's helping hand as if she made the requested bride even more of a sales girl.
For a while, STAN went with TOP 09, then with the people, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs trained in Most by helicopter
Dogs specialising in the search of explosives and search dogs today trained at the Lake Bridge by helicopter.
The police dog must not be fearful and fearful of flying, said the leading police cynologists of the Ústecky Region, Petr Tomášek.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At Most, both adult trained dogs and those who are currently going through training were trained.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were to reveal sharp samples of explosives in the vicinity of the lake and search for a lost figurant, all 12 animals had to board the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
In order for the helicopter to arrive immediately, the dog can go to work so that he does not have a problem with the helicopter's path.
"The dog goes and immediately looks," said Tomášek.
A dog who is restless or on the way by helicopter is unable to start working immediately is excluded from training.
"Most of them then keep them in the garden, for example," added Tomášek.
Police have 76 dogs in the Ústí Region with various specialties.
The German Shepherds prevail, but also the Belgian Shepherds.
It's been treated by a dog from a puppy.
"He raises him himself, prepares him for the service that the dog will do for us," added Tomášek.
The animal shall undergo repeated veterinary examinations which may reveal possible health hendikes.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, he shall submit the first tests in 20 months.
"Tomášek adds to the sharp hit about two and a half to three years.
The length of service with the police depends on the health status of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
They usually live by their dogs.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy is relying on women in politics
The elections can only be credible if all members of the society, including women, take part in the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the UN Auxiliary Mission, said that hundreds of women are involved in the elections, three women are applying for the Vice President's post, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in his Wednesday statement.
Elections can only be fully representative and trusted if women participate, as well as any related process relating to the elections.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban has published several threats to the electoral process, which shifts international action to second place.
For the first time in this year's elections, a democratically elected government transfers its power to the following government peacefully.
Haysom said that the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
Afghan independent electoral committee stated that the total 3.6 million registered voters account for 1.2 million women.
A unique brewer cooks beer again.
For a good beer in a resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners came back to the life of a brewery in Lobč near Mšena a few years ago.
Brewery resembling for the first time in 1586 has a Renaissance core, and in the nineteenth century it was converted into paro-technical operation.
It followed years of bloom when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was stopped during World War II, and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the state ship.
The evil work was done by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and disassembled into building material.
In 2007, however, there was a new hope in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov.
They began repairing buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of construction and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to the study of archive materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The beer has the same form as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was appreciated by the declaration of the Brewery as a cultural monument to the Ministry of Culture and in addition, the construction became part of the European Industrial Heritage Path.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was renewed.
If you want to taste the great Lobečský beer in the picturesque Kokořín Region, visit the bar on the brewery grounds.
In cooking beer, coconut water springs in the protected landscape area, malt from the Lobce fields, and frog hops are used.
You can taste the traditional light spoon in the hood, but also dark beers and specials.
And don't miss a tour of the brewery, it's on Saturday and Sunday at noon and at half past 2:00.
The biggest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest strengths of its type on a global scale?
Thus, the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí, was to be a unique building.
Originally, it was to be made up of up to twelve bunkers connected to large underground.
There was supposed to be a headquarters, a barracks, ammo warehouses, materials, a power plant, a engine room and a hospital.
However, the construction was terminated by Munich's agreement.
In less than a year, the only huge reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the fans of Stachelberg, who began to reconstruct unique construction in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The underground is made available from 75 percent!
In addition to the walk cabin T-S 73 with exposure and underground and an armed object of light fortification, there are two built-in foot screws, digs and educational trail fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cozy altana and stunning views to the landscape guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has come to the list next to monuments such as the Great Wall, the Traian Port near Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
The monastery Chotěšov originally from the beginning of the 13th century, which today forms the huge four-wing building of the convention above the beautiful garden.
The list he's made, but unfortunately, belongs to unique constructions that threaten to disappear.
But the superintendents don't want to give up, and they do a lot of action to support the convent.
One of them is the next annual Evening for the Chotěšov monastery this Saturday, on the fifth of August, where will be performed by Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Vlase, you will see the fencing performance and look at the places of beautiful large buildings that are usually not accessible.
But just enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Know the plant with one click.
The new free Pl@ntNet app will help students with herblers and ordinary plant lovers.
If they are interested in what plant they have just encountered on a walk, they will be advised by this application.
All they have to do is photograph the plant, and the application recognizes what kind it is.
The new application, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Centre of Ethical and Environmental Education in the Bratislava Horské Park within the project Secret Life of the City.
The project included students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers in the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download on the site Secret Life of the city.
The main aim of the French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application of their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"The children who keep the tablet or phone in their hands can go into the woods," said Ivana Poláčková, the coordinator of the project.
Based on sufficient photos of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name in seconds, which will then be assigned under the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech.
It is therefore welcome that users will contribute to the application by image of a plant that is not yet present in the database after the account has been created.
"Francouz will assess whether it is beneficial, and then add it to the database," Poláčková reported.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The trade unions require assurance from managers of the manufacturer of McVitie's biscuits on a long-term obligation to produce at the factory in Glasgow.
The Scottish trade union GMB stated that the company is still silent about any investment in a factory in Tollcross.
There are more than 500 employees in the factory who manufacture Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products.
The owner of the McVitie's, Pladis, stated that she had invested more than £5 million in the whole area over the past few years.
She added that the employees and representatives of the trade unions would be "outside the first informed" in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the company's manager, the Scottish GMBs expressed their concern that McVitie's "will not get his promises to finance and modernise production lines."
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we did not get a clear answer from the builder regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Many families and employees have worked here, mostly from the local community and the Glasgow region, where the work in the factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
From the point of view of work, wages and benefits - and despite the perspective of Rexit, rising living costs and falling slow production - needs the eastern part of Glasgow desperately prosperous producer such as McVitie's."
The spokesperson of Pladis said: “Tollcross’s staff received a letter from GMB yesterday, and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, because we value the continuing commitment to the employees and representatives of the unions.
Regular meetings with employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago and this meeting was openly discussed many problems.
We have spoken with employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which is true for all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and efficient operation.
We value the heritage of Tollcross and locality, and in the event of any change in the operation of the local factory, employees and representatives of the trade unions will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret her concern for Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to get on his side after she has deposited £ 189 million, that is, the amount needed to redeem Neymar from the contract, but has this French team warned Barcelona of its record raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer has opened up the waters of summer transfers. Ligue 1 Club is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, which paid £89 million for it last season.
After confirmation and completion of the transfer Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best paid professional athletes in the world - after tax the PSG team will collect over £500,000 a week.
Barcelona is enraged by the way Neymar made a commitment from his contract, despite the fact that the confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to satisfy Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this three years ago by the President of the PSG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
“I’m not afraid because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we certainly address one of their players,” said Al-Khelaifi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to win one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the line when she expressed interest in PSG Marc Verratti in the summer.
The PSG made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances would it allow the Italian representative to leave, so it is possible that Barcelona now swallows bitter pill for its bold dealings with Neymara's departure.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump nodded against the anti-russian sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madur.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything with the North Korean threat, and that is not going on.
Even from that, it cleans the idea of sanctions like shoe straw.
You can't throw those things in one bag.
Madur's Venezuela really set out on the road to the dictatorship, and totality.
China does not just act as the American President would wish.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to summarize all this so that even a common voters, American, European or other, understood what it is and what a system of rules is based on sanctions, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump only extends what President Obama has already set up to do, but he has just given him an executive stamp.
Then why all the excitement?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if the US elections were won, it would include Putin and withdraw sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, it's the opposite.
The penalties are not released with Trump, but are tightened.
But Europe is scaring even more.
German Minister Zypries says that Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Like, koshers are just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-russian sanctions of the EU.
The Head of the European Commission, Juncker, complains that Trump's sanctions are threatening EU energy security.
I mean, are sanctions supposed to be used just so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
The ordinary voter's snooping.
Three years he heard that the fate of the Russian sanctions depends solely on the fulfilment of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
Now he learns that this is about the EU's energy security.
Volley's snooping around.
There are sanctions coming to Russia for being put too far where it doesn't have to.
China is thinned for being mounted very little.
Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship at the borders of his country.
All those sentences or only considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, a rule or a rule?
Andrej Babiš: I do not consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš is married, crossing the Republic with his visionary book and finalizing the electoral programme.
In addition to the Parduba Region, he has all the candidates ready.
According to his words, he did not interfere significantly with them.
He even agreed to lead the Moravian-Silesian hetman and shadow minister of education ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"If he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Member or a hetman," confirmed Babiš.
You've upset a lot of representatives and national politicians with your point of view that direct elections by mayors and seniors should run villages and cities alone, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we vote directly for the President, and I am convinced that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
In my book, I don't talk about interference with the deputies, they can be there.
The question is, how many will there be?
In presenting your book about what I'm dreaming about when I happen to sleep, I heard on your own ear that you were talking about canceling the reps.
I don't remember.
I was talking about direct choice and reduction of the number of representatives.
New York City with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor says she doesn't build much and prepare big projects, but she doesn't have the authority to do it.
The same is true of a government that only two people, Klaus and Zeman, were in our history.
Which I'm not saying is that they did it right.
But the current Prime Minister is in control of nothing. He's the only one who's moderated the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
He'd be perfect, but it's hard to enforce.
In the program, we only have a change to the one-wheel choice to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and the amendment of the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber in order to prevent unnecessary exhibition of Members who are supposed to work mainly in committees and committees, not to be present at the House's meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That as a dictator you will control the government, control the House with 101 Members, cancel the Region and the Senate and, through grateful mayors and mayors, you will rule the country.
I'm sure it's not like that.
There is nothing wrong with us discussing the number of Members.
The French President Macron announced a reduction of a third of the legislative congregation, while there is a legislator of 57 thousand French, while it is based on 17 thousand Czechs.
Of course, no one accuses Macrona of threatening democracy.
Even if someone had won the elections most of the time in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms that would have prevented him from making some dramatic changes.
But the proceedings for those who have a parliamentary majority are great, just to look at Poland or Hungary.
No such thing in the case of the movement NO.
We just need a team that will work for people in the government, not for parties or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that only teachers, cultural workers, and social services will increase.
Why did they vote me out and add 21 percent to the GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Is that what you'd do as a Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is to intervene when ministers act inadvertently, confuse the government with a travel agency and, for the money of the state, would like to do business as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue with the government, the differences are supposed to speak out of it.
The cabinet must have finished material, there is no room for coalition splits, power voting and business, where it is to be decided.
How do you want a team of cohesion when ministers act primarily on the side?
There's a constitutional law above the sides.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition treaty was not valid, and he set Babish out of the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if she is a personality, and she has control skills, there is no need for similar false gestures.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Have you any idea who you'd suggest to be the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all. I don't think we're even gonna be in the government. No one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
That's not the point.
The mayors have acquired a German entrepreneur who would like to cooperate with you, and the people may win the wing of the favored Jiří Čunk.
I don't think so.
ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaoralek, who does not rule out the coalition with NO, possibly Václav Klaus ml will be established in ODS.
I'd leave it on the voters.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of the economy.
So the okamurists come to be seen as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it like that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, ran like a Vita Barty puppet for a VV, then got money from the dawn for his company, ran some puck there.
Of course, he's a distinct personality.
Of course, it's a bit brown.
If I take his program, there's a wide-ranging involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, and that's okay with it.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you speaking at gallows demonstrations and wants to get out of the EU?
We don't think about working with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to benefit from it.
What about the silent support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It'll be about negotiating the winner with the other one in order, but God knows who the winner and who the two are.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to reach the agenda of the coalition government.
Let's go back to your efforts to manage the state as a company.
But the government simply has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go, he never made a decision.
Coalities like ČEB or EGAP were not working.
After all, Saturday is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
As soon as he did, CEZ took over the Czech government.
After all, it is incredible that the Prime Minister has delivered a resolution written by CEZ management, which he imposes on the Minister of Finance, how he is to vote at the CEZ General Meeting.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the staff conditions of the Supervisory Board and replace CEZ Summit Management?
Jesus, if I'm the Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not one yet.
It is said that CEZ has already sent signals to your direction.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to exchange for even better with YES.
Maybe after the election, everything will go on again.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any humble or Rose lobbyists, I'm a separate unit, and I don't care about that at all.
Then answer directly.
If you become head of the government, will you strive to exchange the management of CEZ, Czech Television or General Health Insurance, i.e. the institutions that you criticise?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is monitor Mr Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he's supposed to stand in CEZ Majority, he's never driven it, he's only been numbered, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter to me.
CEZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them in a subsidiary company, arrange financing, create a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state is to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech Television?
Some of her shows against me are running a permanent purpose campaign, but I don't have and I don't have any competence to fire anyone.
But to control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay around 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television charges, but they don't really know how these institutions run.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of CEOs of ČT and ČRo.
Look at the way those reports are being discussed, the super-power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission for escapes from the investigation files and to lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push me out of the government, which hit the top 09 percentage, but the ČSSD took them off.
They're afraid of disrupting their corruption system, so they're talking about threatening the democracy of Babiš.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how First Vice-Chairman ANO Jaroslav Faltýnek builds the power background by putting his son in charge of the Board of Supervisors of Tepláren Brno and by ordering a related lawyer Květoslav Hlín with municipal and state companies such as Prague Transport Company or Czech Railways?
That's a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I've regretted it a few times.
Faltanek argues that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Minister of Finance, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, Kratochvíl, Březina.
If there was any indication of clienteleism in our house, we immediately fired such a man.
In this respect, I am uncompromising.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
