Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the law on the basis of the amendment of the Criminal Code, under which the leader of the opposition, Julija Tymoshenko was sentenced.
An adjustment that would open the way for the release of a prisoner ex-premier was rejected by Members at the second reading of the proposal to mitigate penalties for economic delinquency.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for concluding an alleged adverse contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final, the appeal is due to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko refers to a judgment as a political vendetta of the regime, suspected of the prejudice of the court brought trial even in the West.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which an ex-premier was sentenced, supports 147 Members in the vote.
226 votes were needed for its approval.
Libya’s Victory
The story of the Libyan deliverance, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert, and without him it is after the war.
The only thing left to define is the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists will win the election, but it is about whether moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customary law of Sharia, and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, for theft is by hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from faith await execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, a company consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be order in Libya that we can't imagine, and that we wouldn't want.
But our way of life is not the only one, neither objectively the best, and it probably would not suit for change, for example, the Libyans mentioned above.
In fact, it is a wonder that the Islamic warriors took gratitude from unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse is that from their point of view NATO was not driven by any NATO general from America, but Alah, whose size they celebrated in every successful intervention.
So when the winners of Libya seek themselves, the west is not one of them.
We took part in the shootouts, served Islam, and our politicians in the person of the dictator got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not buy out the military.
That's when the locals get away with the problem of throwing away the Crusaders.
But will they have black gold without the occupation of the oil company?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast unprofitable protection of human rights.
Unless it's ruined by the chariah lawmakers.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe got into the investors' view
The statistical shrinkage went over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual Member States have published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy has interquartered, Germany and France are growing.
But today, the debt market is breaking records.
Investors no longer look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of economic developments for the third quarter of Europe.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5%, France increased by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better off than expected (increasing by 0.3% of the original 0.1%), but France stated that it had appeared in a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original figures were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy rose 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, the gross domestic product (DPD) stagnated on a quarterly basis and, according to the Czech Republic, confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic performance growth.
The results are worse than the analyst's estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy rose 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated between year and year.
The German economy increased by 0.5 percent in the third quarter according to preliminary and seasonal data.
Both the euro area and the European Union have increased by 0.2 per cent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The return on her 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The proceeds of Italian and Spanish bonds are increasing to critical borders.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and...
The proceeds of Czech 10-year bonds are below 4%, although the situation in the region is getting worse.
Germany has heard that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrates the procedure for 200 million
Football representation the hardest task of the season managed!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Bohemia and beautiful goal Petr Jirák won 1:0.
Czech football and a large portion of happiness in the second half have won a luxury lead from home retribution and will again not be missed at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz has been watching a progressive match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of happiness in the other.
The Czech representation also thanks to its home waste in the end, the great Czech and hero Jirák won a happy one in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrates the progress of the European Championship.
Because of precise defense of the Czech unit, the black-horts were in pressure at the second half-life.
The losers of the struggle became Damjanovich with the Vájnicer who burned two great chances.
Even thanks to the great Petra Čech, the Czech team will not miss the European Championship next year, and a prize of approximately 200 million crowns will also come to the cash register of domestic football.
A lot of fighting football has been playing since the opening minutes.
Both teams were just hard to get involved in a combination and played mostly around the middle line.
Therefore, the pressure of domestic footballers did not come in the first half, long kickers for defense in the Czech defense precisely turned away.
Iranian students are prepared to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around the nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country's nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the object on Tuesday at noon and then called for the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students of the University of Iran in Isfahan created a live shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, in which uranium is processed.
They show that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) stated that Iran had apparently not stopped seeking a nuclear weapon.
The possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is discussed in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Islamic nuclear facility and then called for the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at making Iran's nuclear programme as much as possible, Israel's press would also have the aim of a facility in Natanz where uranium is enriched, in addition to the ISphaan centre.
obese baby's dinner: she doesn't have breakfast and she's having dinner.
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, with an excessive weight of 9 percent of schoolers and obesesis 5 percent of children.
Obese children often come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as demonstrated by the current survey.
Once again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which he grows and the patterns that surround him.
For example, in obese children’s tables, incarnations are more likely to occur than in families of children with normal weight.
The fried fries had for dinner the day before the research associated with educational events called Obesity is no coincidence more than 19 percent obese.
In the fat families, it is also not customary to sports, which concerns most families of today's schoolers - only 15 percent of children replied that their parents will at least once a week find time for active movement.
Examine between 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year's school and was attended by nearly 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesita event, not a coincidence, which supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
More than 12,000 pupils from 4 to 8 classes have been involved in the project so far.
The proper eating and sufficient movement in the family is one of the determining factors that cause a dramatically rising number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the people questioned said, for example, that five times a day in breakfast-snack-snack-snack-dinner, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper nutrition," is one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and no food tonight
Experts point out that both essential and relative details are relevant for healthy development, including regular family breakfast times.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the schoolers’ families eat at the same time.
Most families eat breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding that in the ten homes, breakfast doesn't go at all.
Breakfast is at the heart of the right daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries consume much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
Although regularly more than 40 percent of the children asked about sports, the result was less than half - 15 percent with their parents.
Set up your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own diet options according to their own taste and opinion.
"The correctional preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite meals is a lot of flour, meat and sweet food.
"Alarming is especially a great popularity of sweet lemonade," says the final report for the survey.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta won just over the poultry.
But children didn't want legumes at all, and it's also low that likes fish and midday vegetables.
Affection to health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their dietary habits if they get the right information.
"There was no coincidence in many cases a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," says the results of the project.
Markant, for example, was the case with sweet sodas, where more children would prefer ordinary water.
Children have also checked the poultry and fish questionnaire much more often as the main dish of the day and would limit sweet foods and dumplings.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, claims pro
In my opening article on how stylists were taught, I had so little complaints that there was a lot to do in the opening hours.
I had no idea what would follow.
Lectures of three professions in the field, dressing up problematic characters and a seminar about how it goes to the square.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "caught".
This time, Director Alenka and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly uniform character.
And that's the vast majority of them.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy with no proper curves, and someone's overweight again.
The stylist must know how to optically soften the wide shoulders, extend the neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We have been given tips, both for Jennifer Lopez's, bigger breasts and hips and a narrow passport, to emphasise the character and at the same time not to dress too challengingly.
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is that the skirts or pants really do not fit, then it is worth making at least one of those pieces custom-made.
Surely you won't regret it, because perfectly falling clothes are priceless.
In a dress to suit you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves, increases, stays in the waist and so on.
The boy figure can also afford to wear clothing with folds, applications, embroiders or picks.
There's a lot of information and character types, of course, so I'm glad I have a week to get all the information in my head.
And yet, I'm afraid, given the assignment, it's all too much.
Each of the trainers received a assigned celebrity, to which he is to invent two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current look, the fashionable style of the individual and the type of character.
I'm gonna "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my spirit I rejoice, for me personally certainly better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a hundred pounds (please take, in terms of exaggeration), or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut out of magazines or look up on the Internet and print them and then print them.
Moodboard, as the whole result is said, will also express our personal style and relation to graphic design.
Think about the graphic page styling is important.
The stylist does not only dress physically but also creates for example the so-called product pages in magazines (for specific purposes, such as handbag trends, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But it's Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture, filled with information about characters types, was prepared by three guests in the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a skillful stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
The variability is crucial in this case.
So, for example, a t-shirt (or if you originally want a t-shirt) can be worn classically over jeans and a shirt like a coat, but you can also dress it on a bare body, shoe the boats and take pictures like a dress.
Or just pull up your sleeves or collars, and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly to work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said James.
So I can finally see why we're crushing all the tricks we're dealing with, what's the point, but even in fashion magazines, we're seeing something else.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have a lot more variations of clothes ready than they can take.
So at a fashion story that will have ten sides (that is, ten outfits) I must be prepared to "stand" at least fifteen.
And also that in a picture of the clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces of the teddy entirely different than in fact.
That's what we have to count on when we create an outfit.
That image and style makes up to half of the success, confirmed by Honza Pokorný.
Just look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miracle singer, but the image and marketing made her a world-class star.
In the Czech Republic, access to the use of stylists' services is rather cold.
Even the familiar faces consider it useless (although I can do something, the way I look is secondary).
And if someone already gets styling from us, then we're supposed to expect that we're most likely going to have a completely different size than it really is.
Then there's nothing to go around to see if the boulevard wrote about how the celebrity in question died and so forth.
Honza and Mario put on our heart on Sunday, that the stylist was not enough to be fashion-oriented and to be able to fold an outfit.
In his work, he communicates primarily with the people he wears and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to estimate people, not to encourage themselves, to stand by your opinion.
"When a manager orders you to clean her closet and fill it with nice pieces, you can't throw out the whole closet and tell her, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things there that you will praise and recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what everything must contain the so-called "plate" or bag on the square.
It's the one you put around your waist and you have all the money you need.
In addition to bright things such as scissors, hair rollers or pins, there are also silicone thread (with it the stylist helps to shoot products such as handbags or hats), special clips, which we put on the back of the clothes, if larger (spendler or other clamps are not allowed, would damage the clothing), or the sewing machine.
In order not only to listen, but also to practice, we learned how to put our shoes on properly.
Even in a photo shoot in an atelier where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glueed.
We can't touch the shoes with our shoes so they don't accidentally damage themselves.
There is, therefore, a need for real skill.
Mario comforted me when he praised my creation without reservation.
Because the skill mentioned is not really my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend course.
It's getting more and more clear to me that it's not really going to be a walk with a pink orchard, no matter who's saying what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run is raced across America.
Reviews
Originally carefree driving changes due to a series of completely unnecessary layak errors into a routine morning journey to the shift.
Although the ambition was largely fulfilled, it is not valid if no one obviously wanted to do anything else.
The new subtitled "The Run" woke up before high expectations were released.
He promised that the year-old race series of Need for Speed would again move a piece of the new direction and appeared from playable demonstrations as a game that in the course of action racing would not have to be up to the number.
We were also curious to see how they would get the inserted passages, in which the main hero would step out of the car and run on his own.
But as NFS is used to, many are somewhat different than we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole has been going down a few unnecessary errors that have appeared in the series for several years or more.
So it's not even a mistake, it's a display of some sort of incomprehensible laziness of developers.
Adventure starts very well.
You are introduced into a story whose main hero Jack has certain problems of personal character and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
Behind the wheel you will sit on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than 50 races.
It follows that each plant is driven on a different line and the stages concerned are planted in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
It doesn't feel like a game is always the same.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a world-class thing.
But driving across the desert, the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are sometimes influenced by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you will get into a sandstorm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to fall asleep.
Besides, individual races are well placed behind them.
There's only a few of them, but that's enough.
For a while you try to get past the desired number of opponents (mainly a classic race), then you catch up with the time (classical match with stop marks) and then you will have a duel with one opponent.
The police will get involved from time to time, which makes your efforts even more difficult.
The new thing is passages off the wagon.
It's just an interactive animation where Jack usually runs from someone, and you have to help him by printing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But it is surprising that these passages are much less in the game than you would expect (in particular, perhaps only three).
But as a result, this is beneficial to the point, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and, in the context of the above mentioned above, it ranks with the elements that make up the game.
The driver's model is in the tracks of the previous parts.
This means that it is definitely not something anymore, but it is not possible to say that it is a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will need to look elsewhere.
But the driving model still fits more and more effectively, even though we could find a better one in the competition.
So, everything's in perfect order.
But the problems begin to occur after some time.
Unlike the driver's model, the model is not very well.
From this type of game, we don't expect to count complex deformations and collisions, but if practically before any impact into any object you have the slightest idea how your car will behave, then probably everything isn't all right.
Typically when driving or passing cars in normal traffic, you can easily lick each other, but at other times in almost identical situations your car will end up in wild pirates.
Or even assault.
I mean, thanks to the restart system, it doesn't bother you much, but it's going to blow you apart.
The restarts are solved in such a way that if you break or go far off the track, the game will throw you back on the last catch point on the track.
However, only five restarts are available in each race.
If you drain them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool in case things don't work out than if you can rely on them explicitly.
Sometimes even restarts do not help, solve them when they need to learn the section of the race from memory.
The great failure of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, need to be done in a specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit into them.
In other cases, you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, five, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
It will upset especially in situations where you see your opponent passing through two opposing cars in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are in such a position that you have to travel or slow them down.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's "counted" so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
The opponents have another advantage.
During the whole time of playing, you will encounter several places where you will again, regardless of time, always pass the same opponent in the same place.
Most of all, it hits the end of the game on the long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The enemy must clearly get there at any cost.
When he's driving in front of you, you're getting a little bit worse at the counter-driving cars, so you're gonna be out there a couple of times.
One can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline, but the performance is so obvious that it will truly distaste you quickly.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and places as well as action, that sometimes you literally don't manage to watch where what flies.
And it doesn't really matter if the concept of 50 unique lines, sorting races is worth it, so that boredom doesn't stand a chance or anything else.
The unconventional idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gas pumps by the road, because that's where you can change the car, even though in most cases you'll be fine with what you've got.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The supporters are suitable for urban areas, strong American bourbon on a flat highway and exotic supersports on technical riding, for example by clicking on the mountain roads.
With the main story regime comes hand in hand and mode challenges, which are races in individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common for challenges and story.
Various items are unlocked for higher driver levels: starting with cars and ending with background for profile.
It is also connected again to the online Autolog functions, which inter alia compares your results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard to understand is the situation of the last race in the story.
With your car you can get to the subway tunnel (so be it), where you take it in the dark by rail (so be it).
The numbers are flashing between 150 and 200 km/h on the tachometer, and in the back there is a set of subways coming along and you are uncompromised.
In the editor's office, we may still have a few more days to discuss whether no one really thought a little bit about creating the game, or whether the authors think we're really such idiots.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in some cases even great.
It freezes in some more severe moments, and in some cases it goes down tragically.
But this is mainly about a crash with a larger number of participants, where you would not be able to see a smooth image any more.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible range of younger audiences a soundtrack was created from the category "every dog another village", but one can assume that just because of listening to music, someone will not buy the game.
Overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so greatly embarrassed.
If the game would avoid completely unnecessary errors, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work NFS has been in the past few years.
But this is how the game works inexhaustiblely.
I'm sure it's fun, but get ready to make your mistakes go into your eyes with the power of airport spotlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly disrupted the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to settle down, calm down, and before all players get used to their new roles," the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, Milena Vicen, started her lecture at the Law Faculty of Law.
To what extent she takes "Securably and openly about Europe" seriously, she showed in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that she could be envied by a number of UK Law Faculty speakers.
Ms Vicena also praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"First a criticism appeared that he is a grey official, that he cannot perform any role, and I must say that everyone's breath was blown out, that the role was done perfectly."
"He is a man who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate perfectly with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as the answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? Which telephone number should I call?", i.e. a major step towards unification and greater clarity of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from mermaids
She has also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived and will live in the near future.
The previous Czech Presidency called it a success.
The Czechs addressed the emerging financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The government at this time then referred to it as a major negative, which has greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the frmol factor" was not only the Presidency but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being addressed today.
Moreover, a new seven-year-old EU budget has yet to be approved, which is precisely making the current economic situation very difficult.
Whether the budget will be slim and cost-effective, which sectors will be given priority, which will be supported by more and which less, is all on the agenda for the next negotiations.
The ambassador also reminded her main slogans, which she came to Brussels with: 'Europe is clear'.
"I don't really like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, a hanker that no one understands.
How should a citizen understand that they really don't have curved or round cucumbers, bananas in different sizes, or that we really need to be banned from sirens."
It also wants to make better use of the EU's environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative side of things rather than the positive side.
Moreover, she is sorry about the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four has been highlighted.
"Trust me, when Polak and Hungarian come to me and the Slovak comes near me, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you meeting up there, what's your Visegrad four?" and they don't look so excited about it at all."
In the future, according to the Vice-Presidents, new hard rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States are mainly awaited.
As a very real concept, he sees the concept of a two-speed, if not a more rapid Europe, rather than a new "European Federation".
"We have euro area countries and countries outside the euro area."
"We have a Schengen area, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, let only the countries that they want, and those that they don't want, stand aside."
"These institutes will be more and it will be a two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the topics that have an impact on the whole Union are discussed among all Member States, not only among the euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM's innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were looking for a word that would most accurately express the IBM strategy, it would probably be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is perceived as a very current company, and yet it has been 100 years since its founding.
The foundation of this long-term life was laid by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already hit the password that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" thus became a print around which the life of the future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine, which began in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her fundamental values, while not afraid to change everything else around her.
That allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second hundred we can achieve even more," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company.
Developed system
Watson took care of his employees in the 1930s, like Baťa in the Czech Republic - people from IBM had, as one of the first American employees, paid leave, insurance from the employer plus elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and traders.
The same sophisticated has a long-term IBM relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company has been brilliant in exploiting talent - as one of the world's first companies, it has abolished any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana will be headed by IBM next year by Virginia Rometta.
She has been in IBM for thirty years, still in the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has in recent years made so-called pits, on-line bridgestormings, many of which are emerging future strategies and innovations.
No wonder ideas are enough - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a good name
A firm's strong internal and external image provides a strong position in the business.
"From the beginning, IBM has had an institution's concept rather than just a technology company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," said George Colony from Forrester Research.
As the company says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM - or "Big Blue", as it names her familially because of her logo in the United States - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a hundred years.
It is probably the most extensive technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnologies.
They hold the most patents from all U.S. technology companies, and five of their employees won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include ATM, payment card, financial swap, barcode or disk.
IBM has become about $220 billion this year the second largest technology company according to market capitalization (the first one is Apple), when Microsoft was the first time since 1996.
View forward
Not all products and innovations have hit customers' taste and time - IBM has for example failed to make a bet on its own OS/2 operating system, on-line Prodigy services or IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on the move forward, you cannot emotionally bond to the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they do not work, leave them.
Unlike, for example, competitive Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Prospective technologies
In IBM's sales, the services are the largest share of the services, after about a fifth of which they are software and hardware.
In 1990 he was the strongest hardware representative with more than half a share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets worth $15 billion, and it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technologies during the same period.
Investments have also continued since the first new financial crisis in the world was exaggerating.
IBM acts in accordance with the reference of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who has also increased the volume of investment during the major economic crisis.
So far, IBM appears to be experiencing an intact crisis.
The price of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, and the net profit of the company continues to grow.
IBM's company password is to change everything but its values.
Therefore, even if the next crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
History IBM: From cheese slicer to space
IBM (International Business Machines) was established in New York 100 years ago, originally had a complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over only in 1924 - originally it was a brand used for branch offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later IBM gave a merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980 ’ s.
They owned technology such as famous "sniffs," which means hours recording employees' arrivals and departures.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairman of the board of directors by 1930.
Flint hired a competitor named Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
The leader then dazzled the founder of IBM - so far the invincible corporate culture and identity is built on Watson's ideas.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as indicated by its name, started with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from meat slicers and cheese to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson was in charge of the company, he doubled his turnover to nine million dollars, and began a major expansion of the company into all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior, almost 40 years later in the head chair.
Under his leadership, IBM started working on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA drive flights to space - Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 famous human flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed its first family of computers in 1964, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fifty," which developed the computer standard of that time, called IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of the computers of the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and started to fully provide advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid off in the last three years - the Smarter Planet concept, the Smarter Planet.
Its aim is to use technology intelligently in areas not yet planned and to improve the situation in, for example, transport or urban management.
For the area of trade, IBM recently launched the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia in then 1932 as in the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, besides IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a research team of the world level dealing with voice recognition.
An unfaithful husband kite:
Iveta, keep the donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtář (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Richtár (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also the lover, Darin still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now she has to wait, and she's set clear rules for her next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," explained Rychtář.
When Darina Rychtář gave asylum to Bartoš in her house in summer, she did not seem to see how her marriage would end.
Even though Iveta had moved out of Říčany for 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Darina resigned in time, accepted her husband’s relationship with her husband, and now she even said good-bye to him forever.
Rhysters don't care who his wife is sleeping with.
If the Rychtář and Bartoš were to break up once, his wife’s open arms wouldn’t be waiting at home.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our house together, no one will expel him."
"But he will live him not as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Rychtář said, saying, "that she has already separated herself from her husband and insists only on mutual obedience.
Joseph, the fact that Darin's locked his back door doesn't matter yet.
"I respect the decision of the wife."
"I'm going to be with Iveta, and I'm not going to change it."
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, gardens, real estate, I shop."
"Darina and I are having a normal conversation, except we don't share beds," said the Lightning Rychtář.
If Rychtář also found a new love, she said she wouldn't be able to stop it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she's going with, and if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and I take all responsibility," said Joseph.
Worst women's bad habits: do they apply to you, too?
If you ask the men if they could name any typical women's bad habits, they'll usually all be thrown out of their sleeve very quickly.
Dear women, do you know in the following lines where there are several women's evil habits that can perfectly pump blood into the veins of men?
Shopping
Does your other half tell you you're addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like shopping and buying in bulk?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least tame their purchasing passion a little.
But tell me, which would resist it just walking around the clothes stores, looking for good falling tops and then all of them (in different color designs) try them in the booth?
Even though it is a hobby for most women to shop for, it can become literally a hell of a man.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you before the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start practicing?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do these sentences remind you of something?
Isn't it?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to their partners constantly complaining about their appearance.
The stronger the sex is also agreeing that the more the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying the women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless carousel.
Washing windows, sucking, wiping tiles, washing dust, crushing bathtubs - at least twice a week.
You tell your partner he stepped on a dirty pavement, kids, that they soiled a crushed sink and wrapped a glassy living wall with which you had so much work to do?
If you suffer from this exact "failure", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and purity should certainly not stand within the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for cleanliness may endanger your relationship and family well-being.
Sneezing
"You used shorts toss in the trash."
"You're gonna wear old socks tomorrow, too?"
"The wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you snoop into your partner several times a day, know that you can beat him up with confidence.
Of course you don't mean any harm, you want to make everything okay.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn't have had to get so much...
Chatting, gossiping
For some women there are also gossip, gossip, as well as insulting and conspiring against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, who, how, and why.
Perhaps each one of us will release some harmless gossip or clown in here.
A hand to a heart, it's a hand to all women.
On the contrary, there are gossips of the thickest grains that they like and often murmur, perhaps despise everyone and are particularly dangerous to their surroundings - especially within the female working collective.
Jagr and Voráček helped to win Philadelphia
The hockey attacker Jaromír Jagr participated in Monday’s NHL game with two assists to win Philadelphia 5:3 on the ice of Carolina and is again at the head of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was declared the best player in the game, benefited from a survey of a nine-year-old star.
Two assists in the match were also recorded by Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jagr told the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a big evening.
"I told him before the game he'd give the hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get this feeling," explained Jagr, after whose action Giroux gave the goal of the first Flyers missile.
A little later, the second hit by the team had a Czech lead.
Worms fought behind the Hurricanes' goal and presented it to Maxi Talbot's score circle.
The second before the first break reduced Patrick Dwyer's domestic player, but the introduction of the second part belonged once again to Flyers.
Especially Giroux.
After working with Jagre, he scored a third goal, then he turned his missile over in the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs to the best three," Jagre appreciated his center.
"I never thought I'd play hockey at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL my teammates tried to play me, now it turns," said Jagr.
Carolina made a drama out of the game, a goal by Tuom Ruutu, and once again by Dwyer, who got out of a criminal shooting, she got the difference between one goal and the other.
But Matt Read wouldn't let another complication end in number two on one.
"He has done a great job in our Pronger zone."
"He cut off the disc, I took the speed and (Read) went to the farthest pole."
"I tried to hit him, and I'm glad it worked out," he described the last goal of the game from my point of view Voráček.
Philadelphia was led by the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defenseman of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not win the game against Buffalo, in the second third he resigned due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
Candiens, next to the experienced barrel, lost the two-brand lead and lost after the penalty shot of 2:3.
One of their raids didn't turn Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach rather than the lost points of the frost the vast marshe of the rear row, while the match was only played by five defenders.
"It's bad."
"We only played the game with one experienced player, the rest were young men."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The rotation of the rotations was on us and we couldn't resist."
"We were supposed to simplify the game, push the puck out of our zone."
We had gaps in that," said one of P.K. Subban's defenders.
Ondøej Pavelec's Czech goaltender contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions to win 5:2 over Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters were involved in the Jets goals that interrupted the five-game game series.
How Tour Prices Developed since 1989
Only five state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia were allowed in 1989: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travellers at that time sold in the vast majority only tours to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled on vacation to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Soci in Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was from 1962 to 1972, when the possibility of travelling to Yugoslavia was also possible, but then the Yugoslav regime tended to the West and Czech tourists' journeys to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that it was not a citizen of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovakians) that allowed them to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
If the citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise an individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time offered also tours to the West, but it was necessary to stand the front over the night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good-known" in the travel agency.
However, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically distrustful people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, but without foreign exchange promise it was not possible to obtain funds (Western Currency) for the journey to the West.
The most often, however, Czechs spent their vacation in the country, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs have acquired and still survives today.
The travel of the Czechs has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While the holidays in the NDR and Bulgaria were our maximum until 1989, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of leave in countries around the world.
A huge paradox that we no longer realize today is that it was not possible for us to travel to the most popular Croatia by 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
At the end of the 1990s, visa requirements in neighbouring Western European countries were abolished, starting with a huge wave of short-term visits mainly from Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't get enough trips to the West for a while, and everyone wanted to take a look at it for a while.
For example, in Paris, we slept tours of Czechs in parks in tents, because our revenue at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czech travel was to carry your own food, canned dishes, salamis, etc. to save yourself.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely variable Czech crown, so our tourists could finally purchase a Western currency after many decades.
However, our standard of living and with this, average wages rose, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Due to increased travel demand, travel agents have regularly started preparing charter flights since 1997, thereby making air trips possible to negotiate quantitative discounts compared to the past incredibly cheaper.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had already had visa-free contacts in virtually all the developed countries of the world, except the US, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutional travel occurred right in 2000, when thanks to considerable demand it was taken from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to exoticism, it was to Thailand.
From this year on, the Czech tourists fly straight charters out to warm faraway countries, and this winter will fly straight from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are now visiting around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutional development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. visa for Czech tourists finally became one of the world’s most advanced countries.
In 2008 Czechs also spent more than half of their foreign vacations (50.3%) for the first time in history and spent more than 15 thousand CZK per person for one foreign holiday, including the cost of stay.
The General Assembly is to find the President, but once again, there's a path
Almost five months of Czech football is without the President and there is a danger that the successor of Ivan Haska at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known for another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburka.
There is still no agreement according to which election order it will proceed.
Without it, she won't even start voting on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The Czech football has an interest in leading Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hasek resigned in June and invited his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead the football in the future.
But in the era after Hashek, football slipped back to the stakes between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
It turned out to be full on September 16, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Meeting gathered in the National House in Smíchov for nothing, because the negotiations were blocked and it was not just the way of the election.
In fact, there has been neither agreement on who has the right to vote at the meeting - either only the statutory representatives or even the officials with full authority.
A partial agreement has been reached at this point since then, which has helped also the recommendation of the Constitution for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
But there are still disputes about the electoral order.
The Executive Committee, which, in its dealings, whether proper or exceptional, has not brought much too much into the situation, is essentially nothing else.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neurological point is still the same.
The question is: how do we proceed in round 3 to exclude the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the Association.
According to the proposed model, the third round will win one of the candidates who will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running.
Morava is allegedly willing to go to a retreat to win a candidate who will receive a higher percentage of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech party advocates the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds in this percentage.
"But it would leave the sense of the previous two rounds, it would completely deny the two-compartment concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian Party Freedom, according to which it would be best not to bend and vote according to the applicable statutes.
It is a little surprising that Tomáš Paclík also agrees with this, although it is estimated that the statutes set by the electoral order satisfy most Pelt from all candidates.
"I wish that it should be voted as much as possible according to the statutes."
"In order not to devise any subliminal nonsense like at the last general meeting," said Viktorie Plzeň, who ran for the first time, and in his observations he mainly defined himself against Pelt.
Pelta remains an optimist.
In Nymburka, according to him, the new chairman will be known and believe that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All passions will calm down the possible progress of the national team at the European Championships today."
"Fotbal will again be on a happy wave, he will be more willing to cooperate," says the Apple activist, who has the greatest experience in controlling football at both professional and regional level from the whole three.
Rajchl is more restrictive.
"I hope so, but unfortunately, the situation is very fragmented."
"It is not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to adapt regulations purposefully."
"This may cause the blocking of the general meeting to happen again."
"I hope, however, that common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There's not much time left in the agreement of all sides.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if football generality will be complete by the match.
The aviation special in which they were to travel to Podgorice, among other things, Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, did not leave Prague due to a technical breach in the morning and looked for an alternative to how to transport part of the executive committee to the stage of the barage retribution.
In the end, a decisive meeting at the Ministerial level may be held, which may be held on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to bring the divided parties inside the strongest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the planned general meeting of ČSTV, which will solve the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pack goes to fight for the chairman because he doesn't see the right candidate.
If the head of footballers of Pilsen Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have applied for the highest position.
"If the quality adept existed, I'm fighting for it, and I'm not going for the election."
"But in the current situation, no one could find such," said the ČTK Pack.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclík is being motivated to give Pelt, the alleged election favorite, to try to prevent the FAČR from heading.
He also emphasises that in the event of his victory, he would only last until 2013, when there is a proper general meeting on the agenda.
In his post, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too connected to football events.
"I spoke to some people who would come into consideration."
"For me, it was crazy when some said that at this point they would not even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that look," he said.
Paclík says that Peltov's connection with the chairman of the Plzeň Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Pack to stand in the chair.
"If he had won, he'd be reserving the current state and nothing would have moved forward in the football game."
"In combination with Berbra's support, which is a skilled businessman, it would not benefit football even more," Paclík said.
It also suggests that Pelt's name was heard years ago in the wiretaps during the investigation of the corruption affair, from which Pelt came out without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring."
"And what we would also look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is already taking a look at his earlier statement that "he would sell the Plzeň club if Pelta became chairman".
However, if Paclík triumphed in Thursday’s election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
He is also considering another Rajchl candidate, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd go after."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him as the head of the representation."
"But managerially, he couldn't drive an association."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't do it," said Paclík, who raised great attention in September by standing behind the appeal of the panel of judges led by Ludek Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Pack says he'd be the head of the association.
He refers to his ability to manage private companies, and from last summer Pilsen has also been in charge, which celebrated the premiere league triumph with his support in May.
"I have the strength to change something in the football environment to contribute to its specific cultivation."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, which goes into disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not conceal his antipathy to, for example, the Spartan boss Daniel Křetínski.
One of the priorities would also be to strengthen the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby with political tops to get more money from the lottery tax.
"It's one of the key things a new chairman should do."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties declare, I understand their argumentation, but on a level they must say where the money is going," he said.
As a burden now, Paclík does not even take his connection to the Plzeň club, although he claims himself that the Chairman of the FAČR should be "excessive".
Pelta is connected to Jablonca, Rajchl with Prague Dukloa.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see any sense in transferring my shares to someone hypocritically in the Plzeň club and returning in a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new FAČR statutes that would rule out an electoral heel
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the FAČR would have new statutes that would definitely exclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonic functionary is an optimist in Nymburka before Thursday's meeting and believes that the electoral fight will significantly dampen the success of the football team today.
Pelta had already promised before the election of September that he would focus on representing and acquiring finance in case of election.
The election before the last general meeting decided to go at the last moment, so he could use two months of delay to defend his ideas of driving football and present it in a wider context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels it's high time for an association to lead," means a man who is mainly associated with an apple club, but who has been working in Sparta and the executive committee of the union for many years.
That is why he thinks he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He is convinced that there is euphoria during the time of Ivan Hask's government in the current election problems.
"Forasmuch as the June General Meetings were approved the statutes which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they did not allow different interpretations, we had the chairman since September," said Pelt.
He has just redesigned the most important civil society document to delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's an essential thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He says he keeps trying not to define against his opponents.
He had already seen that he could imagine cooperation with Henry Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and he knew well that his opposing candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He did not attack Thomas Paclík for long, who, on the contrary, did not leave Pelt dry.
"He's had some success in football over a year."
"His attacks, however, were unworthy and many people caught up in the election campaign."
"Therefore, many of them now doubt his true character," said Pelt's opponent's address, who said to remain faithful to the curses he had announced in September.
His strongest weapon, according to him, is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to representations.
It should be an interpretation box of football.
"And I would also try to end all the affairs from the case of Bohemiaans or the sound of last year's corruption scandal."
"Right away, I would have gone to a meeting with the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the whole football," said the C.E.T.T.T.A.
He also promised that his coming to the head of football would not mean any personnel cleaners.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the filling of individual employees," said Strahov, where understandable nervousness is out of long uncontrollability.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that follow the general meeting, they believe that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only point of dispute is how he's going to vote for the third round, we can move past it."
"Fotbal needs credibility, and it only gets here by finally having his leader back," Pelta remains an optimist two days before the possible decisive day of her career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR would start working hard under it
If the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic were elected to a quarter General Meeting by the current Vice-President Henry Rajchl, many people in the Association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he chooses, he will start working hard.
He wants to enforce system changes and make members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemiaans, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football and to continue the work started by previous President Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I'd like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football to youth."
"I'm not saying that I would do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview for the CTC.
"I'm a team player, and I want to share my competences in the executive committee so that each of the members is devoted to a particular area."
"And I'm going to be handing out hard tasks to keep the football a mile forward in every segment of this segment."
"A lot of people wouldn't be happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticising the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he thought about not running again.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people who will constantly throw sticks at my feet and question every step of me," he explained.
"But a lot of people told me I couldn't give up, 'cause then others would give up."
"That's trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He said he was being motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Hashek.
"In those two years, a lot of work has been done, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are processes that will last for a few years, and I do not want anyone to stop them," he said with concern that if another candidate named Miroslav Pelta were elected, he would say that the situation in the union could go back to the time before Hashek.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's the thing I think Mirek Pelta can't."
"He is followed first by people who would play football in such a way that he would be only for the chosen."
"There are a lot of things to blame me for, but I'm sure it's not that I'm taking sides."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the chosen ones," said Rajchl.
It also rejects the claim that it would only be the Czech chairman.
"Though some people try to claim otherwise, I plan to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into a Czech and Moravian part whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would be no current situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
As the head of the Plzeň club Tomáš Paclík was involved in the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-president and sees that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl said, who considers his success to save tens of millions of crowns in disadvantaged contracts, the negotiation of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law.
On the contrary, he takes the co-operation that doesn't pull a rope.
While Pelt claims that he is "disqualified to return his trust to Czech football", the other of the opponents of Paclík considers him a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen this year."
"If he had been elected, he might have continued those things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not fundamentally alter the personnel cast in commissions."
"He wouldn't want to twist it for himself," evaluates Rajchl rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to blue
Julia Stanek
Brouzdals from the point of view of Ufona, a luxury swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels by Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a tour of cities or let his tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show you where the wellness near the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder was published in the last one and a half years on discovery routes, she should not be missing in her luggage: her swimwear.
By lying on the water, she looked up to the height of the artistic dome, swimming across from the marble puddle (a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her on the edge of the swimming pool and admiring carefully restored Art Nouveau spitting pools.
If she liked some of the beachers, she took it to her notebook - with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 sails explored this way the history of the architecture of Meder and presented it now in its published book "Badefreuden (Ray of Swimming)": People's swimming pools in Munich, the historic palace of swimming houses in Schwarzwald,"The hard core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "Cesta for the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
A 46-year-old German is a true enthusiasm of the beach culture.
It's not much of a sport, Meder says, it's something else in the water.
The only thing to be angry is that fans of swimming have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of glory, while runners of health can breathe in the touchy scent of spooky forests or listen to the jolly strangulation of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why, in fact, the spitting mills must always be so ugly," says Mrs. Meder, living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice spitters."
Water level doubles architecture
Sliding in the jump pool and essential oils for the sauna - the factor of comfort is therefore so great that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real pasture for the eyes: "The city of the floors has a man in a spa water level."
"It is transparent, on the other hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: high vault, varied tiles, jumping board.
The maloformat image volume "Badefreuden (Swimming Council)" provides 190 pages with everything that needs to be known about architectural and cultural history of historical oasis Wellnes - but above all, the taste to jump into blue.
A remarkable specimen was discovered by Mrs. Meder's pool collector during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful spas, such as the 100-year-old spas of Széchenyi in Budapest, she found water containing nitrates in the original karst cave (the cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose swimming pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in the building of the shape of a bottle (Város Thermalfürdö in Jashberén).
The beautiful view on the other hand offers many heated swimming pools under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. While a person has a Curish outdoor swimming pool with the eyes of the whole city, the outdoor swimming pool St. Anton can look at the snow covered by Arlberg - and: There is a window in the steam bath from which you can watch traffic on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like a ufo that just landed in the Alps.
Out of the three top open pans in the winter, the steam rises while in the background of the Ötztal mountain to the sky.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every beach, the collectors of Mrs. Meder's swimming pools rose up into the gutter.
Many thermal baths are smelled of sulphur, in the spa Arpad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells of heating oil to the point that you barely believe you got into the healing baths.
The smell comes from a medicinal water containing alkaline hydrocarbonates, which is almost black and whose settles down on the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for nice baths: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luhačovice, she came across closed terrain.
In 1902, architect Dušan Jurkovič designed the spa was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the decaying windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau buildings, she saw how massively growing weeds between the tiles.
On the other hand, they stood up at the magic pool in Schwarzwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas already have three phases of construction; one can discover not only the neo-Romanian elements that come from the time of its origin in 1844 but also the Maurian Hall in the style of Alhambra, which was attached around 1900.
Since the thorough modernisation of 1995 Palais Thermal is a popular spa place known to Mrs. Iris Meder pools, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's a performance already, to combine such a diverse construction style into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
At such a palace, immersing into a thermal pool seems to be a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank checks the commodity trade
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the head of the group wants to raise consequences.
Hamburg -
It is clear for the federal citizens: 84% of the Germans, according to one study, consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of people even ask Deutsche Bank and the other credit institutions to step out of this business because the world’s poorest problems are deepening.
This is the result of the Forse survey by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the stakes of global commodity storms drive prices to a height, and therefore the banks are complicit in the world’s hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Chief Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, although also large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity bets were designed to ensure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, the majority of experts agreed that the high-risk trading interests were cut off from supply and demand - and the poorest ones had profited in the account.
Unlike the competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann’s criticism: He promised that he would check out the complaints and said that no business "is not worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake".
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL ONLINE, the International Working Group controls the extracts from Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year the audit is to be closed, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, then, the bank’s representatives want to report on the consequences.
At the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete refusal.
Ackermann is working with his help on his image.
The Head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened his criticism of the financial sector: "Calling on rising food prices shows, in particular, how drastically the banks today are harming the general well-being."
Have Ackermann perform his duties as the highest bank lobbyist.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all the items in which money is used for food-price bets", Bode said.
"No matter whether Mr Ackermann is about hunger for people suffering or about Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Ackermann’s view appears as surprising, but it is clear that the company’s boss would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before he left the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board would not be able to enter the supervisory board.
By turning away from the disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And there is no need to worry about the possible losses - he should deal with it eventually by his successor.
Each other would declare investments in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Institut Forsa was questioned on 7 and 8 November by 1001 people.
According to this, only 11 percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers the investments with which the stakes on food prices are linked.
Many customers would also have had personal consequences if they had learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: Each other would have testified all the investments in which the money flowed into speculation with raw materials as a result of the survey.
43 percent would warn the known against such a bank, 49 percent would say that it would think about decommissioning its account and move on to another institution.
House of the 21st Century in Vienna
Overflowed pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endem: The Austrian Pavilion of the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 won the prizes, became in Vienna museum, remained empty and decommissioned.
It is now opened again like a exhibition house.
When it gets hot for modern postwar architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials that are typical of faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is an excellent and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then received by the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and highly operating structure made of steel and glass.
The construction is considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He celebrated the architect so that he also built the hall of Austria for the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-Salary plus as the key made by the side construction in Munich, he eventually became internationally famous.
As a temporary exhibition building designed by the pavilion after the world exhibition, it was named "The House of the 20th century" at the Vienna Süddahnhof (South Station), and in it 1962 opened the Museum of the 20th century.
It was not suitable for the museum building, neither spatially nor technically - the walls were missing for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art had reached a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has renovated the pavilion, now bears the name "The House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday night there will be the Museum Belvedere, which the palace belongs to, the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
He argued for the new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a significant career, i.e. at a young figure skater, later at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of Musea moderna Salzburg, has established a strong reconstruction with politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsor money and determined use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculpture of Fritz Truruba should be displayed with the same name foundation, a cafe and bookstore should be created, and an office building must be built to do so.
Strict surveillance, low budget.
The Krischanitz was then an ideal cast.
Not only did he gently reconstruct and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer University of Vienna and the Pavilion was a "immediately important place for him" at which he "every weekend" studied exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which, when it moved to Vienna and changed its use, lost its generosity and ease.
During the present reconstruction there were much bigger problems: The building was a "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were replaced, used glass fibers reinforced with insulation glass and glass roof replaced with a special safety glass.
The cold bridges of the steel beams have been strengthened or replaced, and the asbestos-filled ceilings have been sank.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, an insulated lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a high-rise Schwanzer Hall.
The original entrance door remained preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion red-brown tone.
And the cinema is even the same as it used to be.
And all under strict surveillance of the memorial office and the low budget.
"Sometimes it must have been found material that is good and cheap and also liked the memorial office", says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
The difficult thing is, it was with the Hall that came here from Brussels, said recently Krischanitz, the typical Drop-in-the-City-history.
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and yet wants to "building proper self-confidence".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, because there has been a urbanist happy coincidence: In the vicinity around Schweizer Garten there is a newly designed "town district near Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there will be another happy coincidence: The 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporär Kunsthalle and, as it is heard, is already dealing with the city's neighbourhood at the Schweizer Garten station.
The track is planning a package for the winter crisis at a million points
The runway has pampered a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter period.
The number of employees to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn issues more than EUR 70 million in the newspaper this year.
The Bild newspaper provided a preliminary report referring to the internal group plan that it was said to be calculated in total with investments of around EUR 300 million by 2015.
It is said to help achieve better use of trains and rail networks also under extreme weather conditions.
It is said that it is planned, inter alia, to double the number of internal and external workers to 16 000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The aim is to get rid of the platform until the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary switches over four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the chief of the Rüdiger Grube warned after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives against train failures and delays also during this winter.
In the last winter, the railway in passenger transport had considerable problems, as, among other things, under difficult weather conditions, there was a shortage of reserves.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Federal Railway Authority.
In addition, the delay in the operation of the ICE trains takes place.
The railway also has not been able to control for many years that ICE train repairs are likely to be more likely to be controlled by the workshop when the ICE train at Köln central station was destroyed.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the US
After the start of Josef Ackermann, there are new tramps in the U.S.: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of compensation there.
As if the problems at home were no longer enough Deutsche Bank, the giant in the field of its past in the USA: Frankfurt institutions are paying $145 million in compensation (€106 million) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks in the course of the financial crisis.
It's a mortgage sale.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator calculates a number of large banks that have seduced cooperative banks with false promises to purchase financial products; that they have probably reduced risks.
In the course of the crisis, such papers have lost significantly to their value and tossed the bank into abyss.
"We are pleased that we could solve the subject without having to drag the parties to court," said spokesperson Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank admits no guilt by rebalancing.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
The president of the NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the support of the two monetary institutes.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the United States and supports bankruptcy in order to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to get compensation for billion-dollar damage.
Now the settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also joined other large banks and was sued by JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in summer.
In dubious mortgages it is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American real estate bubble broke out in 2007, it became a number of financial companies fatal.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Even though the event occurred a few years ago, now the banks are blowing a sharp wind in their mouths.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous actions in order to obtain corrections or to bring them into jeopardy.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the biggest wave of actions.
It states to 18 international large banks that two U.S. state-owned moneymen dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's mortgage business at about $200 billion were disadvantaged.
Deutsche Bank must also face FHFA’s action, with more business in total worth about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be accountable for "substantial losses", without, however, stating any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requirements as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters with 10 billion IBM
The financial guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT-business of IBM.
He bought shares worth more than $10 billion since March.
So far, an important US investor Warren Buffet has always claimed that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies will only be difficult to predict.
However, he now read IBM's commercial reports and changed his mind on investment in the business.
He had already had to understand that IBM offers mainly services and provides computer systems for IT-department of other companies.
Warren Buffet's investment is considered to be a knight's match in the financial world.
As a result, mother rock IT IBM may now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffalo revealed to the American economic radio station CNBC that he bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion from March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway thus became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffet Sagte that IBM has not yet known anything about his engagement.
He praised management, which he tried for the economic crisis even for proper income.
"You did a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM has been betting on lucrative IT-services such as the operation of computing centres for a long time.
More than 100-year-old computer pioneers also offer software and advice as well as powerful computers for companies.
Buffett was rather avoiding technology companies until today.
He claims to invest only in enterprises whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for freight rails, lubricant manufacturers or after machinery products.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 subsidiaries also shares in a number of large concerts such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old gentleman took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the most valuable companies in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Omaha Oracle."
When Buffalo’s investments became known, IBM’s shares rose one percent before the storm began.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total price of over $220 billion on the stock exchange and is considered along with Apple and Microsoft for the most valuable technological companies in the world.
At Microsoft, so much Buffet, but he wouldn't want to get in.
The founder of Bill Gates is said to be his confidential friend.
The threat is tangible.
After the revelation of the "Buňka v Zwickau" the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The newspaper even talks about "bloody ideology", which is now alive again.
The murders of eight small Turkish entrepreneurs and one Greek in the period 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkey population in Germany, this report was addressed with fear and concern.
For many German Turks are returning the spook, which has long been considered dead: From the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, yet there was never any doubt.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a range whose dimension cannot be overseeed long ago.
"Does the bloody ideology come to life again?" were the headlines of the Turkish "Haberturk" online edition of the newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasises that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police agent for the protection of the constitution and fear that also the German authorities might be involved in the right radical swamp.
The Turkish community responded decisively: She remembered the weekend by demonstrating silence before the Brandenburg gate of the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish policies, remembered the solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In happy colors, life together was staged as a history of success.
As a shelf there is news of several Turkish media: "German Gift to 50ins" is the title of an article in the Turkish online platform "Haber X", which reports about the background of the murderous series.
Nor can the issue of the "Hürriyet" letter for Germany take away from this thought connection.
"It's starting to stink," the title of the column from Ahmet Külahci.
It stresses that people who paid taxes and worked hard were murdered and made an important contribution to Germany's restoration.
The police procedure and its late success in the search are most critically discussed in the German Internet Forums.
Why not attack the German authorities much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extreme circles, the authors wonder.
Thus many are shown at least theoretically ready to use drastic means: "If activities continue to be so superficially carried out there, there will be nothing left to immigrants but self-defense and armed".
"I hope that's the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarification and appropriateness of punishing the entire network very strongly depends on the inner peace in Germany ", writes "Selen".
Which means if the inner peace in Germany is at risk, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
Photographs of the burn site in Solingen are deep in memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event here has made it more clear to the living Turks that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
However, the assassinations made the Turks a more evident feeling of mutuality.
Do not repeat past errors
At that time, the Turkish press criticised the failure of German politics after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl rejected those in Mölln who survived to visit.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a sympathetic telegram to the Turkish state president, but at the memorial ceremony in Köln he had his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated what charges the Turks had paid.
Quite as if the value of a person was measured according to the amount of his taxes.
The current news coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local state of law is.
In addition to seeking extensive clarification and a new evaluation of right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
A scandalous bank at the Suryške Lake
The most appropriate bank of Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has suffered almost a bankruptcy in the financial crisis and since then it has flowed from one crisis to another.
Now some German is supposed to get it right.
That's not what Axel Weber thought.
After his loud departure from head of management, the Federal Bank became known in July that 2013 will enter almost the same spectacular new job: the President of the Management Board of Swiss Grand Banks UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in a career.
Axel Weber looked forward to the public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its new solidity and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached a turnout."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it was clear that everything would turn out completely differently.
One UBS dealer in London has bypassed all the bank's security systems, and about EUR 1.7 billion has been wasted.
The head of the Board of Directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland recognized banker, had to leave.
Since then, the president of the UBS Board of Directors has also been as ungent - and everyone asks, "When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has become known that Weber Bank has been able to advise since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Governing Board will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
It's gonna be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an issue banker, and he certainly would need time to work.
Then he will assume responsibility for the bank's strategy, which once again proved to deserve the title "The Bank of Europe's greatest scandals"
For the UBS is a huge - until recently it has been the world's largest asset manager - and it has slipped for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, so it seems, the proud Swiss bank will not be spared.
It started in a financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
Image of silent and solid, but also of clever property manager combines ambitious objectives: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So she managed UBS 2007 on one hand with $1.6 trillion more money for wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, she moved into the world's largest banks
That was impressive.
A former banker and later longtime banking professor at Zurich Hans Geiger relates: "I have always referred UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, how could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was clear for the first time that something had gone wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, who was considered to be a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker, left surprisingly behind.
A few months later, they knew why he left.
The investment division of the bank died of Subprime-deniations and had to write down billions.
In order to keep this steady, UBS has been monitoring an increase in capital of really 13 billion francs.
Indeed, she found investors, but such as she would have recently added to her nose: the opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that a person had not even learned its name.
But that was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it developed worse.
The Bank had to admit a new billion-dollar loss, the President of the Management Board Marcel Ospel, 2006 and the second best paid management board of Switzerland, resigned.
A disaster followed in October 2008: the UBS faced a failure to invest in the financial crisis and had to be saved by the State.
The National Bank bought out a billion problematic securities from the UBS, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for the legally variable bonds for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times greater than the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
"One more time we couldn't save the UBS," says the bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by a second.
For a few months now, UBS has been capitulating this in a tax dispute with America and showing a willingness to issue data from wealthy customers who, if possible, have reduced taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return to unauthorized profits from these transactions, including a fine mark.
This helped the UBS to cut taxes more or less openly.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the sanctuary of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it had previously been.
The head of the board of directors and the president of the board of directors followed the withdrawal.
And an exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas over a few months: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in the management of assets to help cut tax.
And just when it got a little quiet again, just when it thought the UBS had recovered again, here comes this unfortunate business anarchist: The only dealer wasted EUR 1.7 billion before the bank noticed that there was something wrong.
And it's clear: the risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"The case of Adobola probably found that the risk control had changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz, Professor of Finance at the Bank Institute of the University of Zürich.
The financial director of the large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that he does not control the risks."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution that Swiss bankers had done with a long time ago to become the watchmen of the great assets of the world: no too much risk, but security for money - also from this side of the Republic of the Alpine has collapsed the world.
The safes of the Swiss banks have become a symbol for unshakeable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its main headquarters in the town of Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curyšské Lake, which is framed by snowy peaks of the Swiss Mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the stores are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's will be found here among Swiss traditional stores like Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been based here: from the Nationalbank to the Palast der Credit Suisse to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of UBS enters through a heavy, rotating door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, there are huge leather chairs, beside the bank's logo a large direction direction towards "seyfu".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
The Swiss bank’s idea of both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes, has been repressed or betrayed by the boss of one small Swiss private bank.
He'd rather not read his name in the paper, eventually shut down, like all Swiss bankers, including both big banks of business.
The UBS has probably grown too much, is finding - especially in the investment banking sector, where the Anglosas have spread.
The Swiss don't seem to have much more to say about it.
"And if they had, they had adapted in long-term English manners."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking, which changed UBS, brought it high profits at first and then a disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven million-million-dollar country took its toll for the greatest rescue event in the history of its nation," wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about EUR 45 billion have been approved by politicians to save large-bank bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
When talking to Swiss bankers, they see a problem mostly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined a massive group.
A bank was created, which was too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and continued to grow.
The two different bank predecessors of UBS added: One rich, but sleepy bank in Zurich with a centre of property management and poorer, but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came in favor of a lot of money that they could spin a large Roulette with.
Two names are associated with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, Head of UBS and Marcel Ospel from 2001 to 2007.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a team of futures," says the bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who manages feelings around the stomach, who has developed himself entirely from banking science."
But I hear Ospel was counting on Wuffli to the end.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "I think he thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
The pride preceded the fall.
The UBS employees clearly remember the fact that Wuffli's company boss kept repeating the same password again: Hit Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She reported "League Tables", a programmer that documented the success of the banks of that time.
In it, the UBS was trying to get a full location upstairs.
She's already done a few steps.
In the foreign exchange trade and the stock participated in the game at the very top.
However, business advisers who have been entrusted stress one weakness: There is probably a great distance behind the biggest banks in international interest trade, in the words of "Fixed Income" bankers.
UBS probably has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided to make an adventure that almost cost it to exist.
The hungry after growth invested both the bank itself and the bank's based fund to secure risks to subprime's investments.
It developed into a powerful machine that repacked securities into American mortgage credits and passed on - but it also left its own risks.
Also, when the other banks were long gone looking for a way out.
"In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it", says Bank expert Geiger.
How big the euphoria is, so deep the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were harder than they thought.
The position at the UBS has become a catapultant seat and has been swinging until today.
He who runs the big bank now has almost incompetent work.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that all close business models have gone missing.
The bank expert Geiger already has an idea: No more investment banking, focus on property management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far (yet) yet.
But investment banking is going to be very strong, so it's clear now.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermoti's new boss wants to introduce his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italy was actually understood only as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he asserted: He has long-term business with UBS, told the Curish bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank back in the mid-1990s.
3500 seats shall be deleted.
That won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking.
Publicly, however, he only says that he and his mistress will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

"We are not an island, but an addict," said Steve Goldman of Goldman management.
Europe is probably not recovering so quickly from recession, and there are other weaknesses in the banks.
The legend of investing Warren Buffett merely confirmed this view: He said in one CNBC-interview that it would probably not be clear if Europe was strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too early from his point of view to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left a few decades old principle and entered the U.S. technology business.

Smart crows spread in cities
In many places the ravens of the field are regarded as "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals cannot be driven out of cities long ago, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The crows have been part of the city’s image for centuries, yet in some municipalities there are complaints about the impurity and noise caused by animals.
However, it is not against "problem birds" yet under surveillance.
The ravens of the field may not be removed from the cities anymore, declared the experts at the first symposia of crows in the East of Leer.
That's where experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible exits.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
Nature conservationists also caused urban problems from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is about to an increasing extent destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecuting, growing construction and cutting typical trees to nest birds makes life difficult.
The crows are protected.
Great colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are in the Vestphalia Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Brém and Leer.
There, the 2005 disputed project of mass killing of crows in the rural district caused negative headlines.
Critics have marked the capture of animals into traps for birds and the killing of sticks for particularly brutal.
"Normal extermination, glooming, nothing brings," the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leer discovered so much.
The removal of nests by spraying water or cutting trees often has undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württember.
"The animals retreat, the great colonies splatter and divide into different places."
Placing is only possible as an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities could not be addressed, the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leeru was.
The combination of expeling animals from sensitive residential areas and attracting them to other places is conceivable.
"The information table instead of chain saws" was promoted by a psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different treatment of animals: "One grit in the face can finally stop self-confidence."
Mrs. Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's educational wound trail to which they provide information board lessons about the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
In the meantime, the project has already been accepted by tourists.
Also, Mrs Jürgens had her own opinion on the criticism of bird noise: "This is every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: the Havrani use not only a tool to achieve the Pamleska, but even as a tool they will make their tool.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge recently tested behavior in four field ravens, how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that stones must cause the destruction of the structure in order to reach the larval pier.
Without great training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone to cause the collapse of the platform.
Then, in the second attempt, the sleazy crows had to solve a more insidious problem.
In a vertically built cylinder, researchers placed a small container with a larva mola.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with their beaks.
Of course, researchers put pieces of wire there.
From there, she created all four animals a hook, with which she hunted from the tube the vessel for the holder.
Three of the four field ravens did it even with a slurry.

Massacre at personal level
An Intimate History of the First World War begins with such a long list of emerging characters when you turn your head.
One advice about how to behave at that moment: carefully rip this page out and make it a page.
You will get acquainted with all people in the novel story of Mr. Englund and this list will serve as a navigation - as a beacon - in moments when men and women in the story will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy to the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite rightly, as "antihistoric work".
It contains several very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energy journalists and debates about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, as "the book about what it was." It deals mainly with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beautifulness and sorrow" combines the war experiences of 20 more than a dozen men and women, both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, get mad or die.
Their lives are like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the contention of fate, while others are extinguishing.
Mr. Englund's book is different from the classic historical novels.
They're making up for the idea that World War I was just about the horrific exterminations in the West Front.
"Beautifulness and sorrow" is also a skillful study of other places where war dramas have taken place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with the fall of bee nests, must spend Christmas in the shade of pyramids, or face the presence of tse-tse flies.
It's almost from the beginning it's a very touching reading.
The war will devour people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When the cannon shooting starts coming along, and you're the woman who's home with her kids, you run away or you stay?
Who's coming?
Almost nobody understands what's going on, not even why the whole war was started.
"The vacuum created by lack of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "was filled with guesses, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beautifulness and sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in a German fleet.
Their stories are taken from résumés, letters and other material already published.
The descriptions of their lives may sound horrifying and enticing, but thanks to the integration of tiny moments and details they are absolutely living and reliable.
Many of them deal with suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Replacements, all over the substitutes."
"Replacement of coffee, copy of aluminium, imitation of rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes further and describes substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "the meat produced from pressed rice cooked in sheep fat (and supplemented with a falsified bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato chips, boots with wooden soles".
It mentions that there was a "837 registered substitute meat in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds inner impulses to wildness and brutality, and declares about war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature, not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or good books, and pretending that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbaric behind that starchy self."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will notice, let alone grieve.
"When you finally accept the sacrifice, you would expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, however, he feels like a "condemnant he secretly hangs".
Further comments concern the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition and a competitive fight," writes Mr. Englund, "the war between factories."
He caught what he said "a new kind of beast of the coming century: a eloquent and ideologically sworn mass killer in a dress cut to the ground that he makes his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People act completely unexpected, mean change with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some sexual illness from prostitutes to avoid serving on the front.
"The most important example of this behavior was the gonococcal pus trade, which soldiers bought and smothered with genitalia in the hope that they would end up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate ones would wipe him in the eyes, which often blinded them to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is breathtaking, but it is not evident, which is a perfect fit for his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, the war captures the way that war "disengaged completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I mostly worked with signs rather than with a comprehensive story, such as the "First World War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussell or novels as "Western Front Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most crushing endings that popularly taught literature does not have similarities.
But I will not give it to you.
However, you will feel like the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled a page out of the list of heroes from his hand and set it on fire.
After the previous mistake, this time per minute exactly scheduled accident
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time Zucotti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the event except for a few high-ranking officers.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the forefront of the action, whose presence highlighted the problems faced by the police department during the operation.
There were no cases of recent weeks when, for example, pepper sprays were used against demonstrators, breaking the rules of the department and, in addition, the wave of sympathy to the public overflowed to the side of squatters.
Therefore, the police operation aimed at cleaning up Zuccotti Park from demonstrators began after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders have been inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
A massive exercise for behaviour in crisis situations took place in the part of Randalls Island, which was the preparation for an event in Zucotti Park.
The leaders strengthened the so-called restlessness prevention training - counterterrorism measures involving the rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - focusing on the city's Lower Manhattan area.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last moment" someone declared the action to whom it was originally explained only as "training".
"I know a few policemen who were also called into this event, and certainly no one said that they were going to Zucotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that he would remain anonymous.
"The fact that you're going to Zucotti Park was known only as members of the department."
One reason for the cover-up was the lesson that the city had already received.
On October 14th, the city officials planned to clear the park, but then they withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, hundreds of them entered the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's events were attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from all over the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen quarters with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that he was coming to the park during the day and leaving a large number of people, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when there would be as few people in the park as possible," he said.
Before the troops set off, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge Bridge, trucking emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
The lights and the recorded message from the amplions scared many demonstrators.
When members of the order units entered the park in their blue windmills, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
The police say that until 1:45 a.m., she didn't touch a single tent, which means she wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack their things.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering at the edge of the park in order to get in if there was any kind of arrest to be done.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief spokesperson of the police department, Paul J. Browne, claimed that this was for their safety.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, and in addition some police officers were rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street along the west border of the park could have made no problem.
The police proceeded westward and swam through the thick confusion of personal protesters, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing, and followed by teams from the hygiene department who immediately took everything left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were removed from the park.
The most turbulent group of demonstrators resorted to the nearest kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some created roadblocks, and the police initiated their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of camp bonded to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
They were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests took place until 3:30 a.m. in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later.
Mr. Browne said approximately 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests were made due to "organization of riots and resisting arrest," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, was the highest-ranking police officer on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Detectives of the Department, took part in the operation personally.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he did not participate in the management of the operation," said Mr. Browne.
The second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, were raised by roadblocks.
Police then developed a protective belt further from Zucotti Park.
Police officers were seen at one point, many of which were equipped with shields, as they push people further beyond that limit.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 A.M., a protester was spotted south of Pine Street, jumping up on the hood of a police car, and several others who released the air from the tires of a police van.
One minute a piece of the stuff came out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, a police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The Union of Assistant Workers will sue the city for release
The departments representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that redundancies were not necessary and, moreover, discrimination due to the disproportionate impact on schools visited by poor students.
The Court over is probably the last option left for the District Council 37 trade unions in their attempt to reverse the release decision.
On October 7th, six hundred and seventy two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, who were among the worst paid employees of the city, lost their release as members of the trade unions for not allowing him access to the health fund managed by the workers, through which the city wanted to put a hole in the budget last spring.
City officials have rejected this charge in a categorically.
At the meeting of the city council last month, the Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council immediately countered that there was no specific mention of the release of auxiliary workers in the budget.
The representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. They will call a press conference on Wednesday, where they will formally announce the action at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendant will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the prosecuting party will be eight redundancies, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen a lawsuit yet, and that's why the individual charges will not be expressed.
According to the new York Times' draft complaint, the trade unions focused on the amount of released in the poor parts of the city, which they wanted to support their allegations of unfair conduct, and they are of the opinion that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funds.
They point out that while in schools in Staten Island, the Upper East Side did not leave at all and even 46 assistants were released in Brooklyn, in the area of District 23 in Brownsville and in the parts of District 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
He recalls that five out of eight assistants lost work at Public School 36 in Harlem, although it is a school where 68 percent of the students live in poverty.
Public School 36's budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year and the school also lost money when the city changed the way bonus finances were calculated for every registered poor student.
In addition, the unions claim that high school directors could have been confused in a way that was written in a document approving the release of parent coordinators.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the event, i.e. cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
" Sixty-six parent coordinators have been released," standing in the draft complaint, "and not only moved to the database to the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to take agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats in the Congress will agree on something regarding the rebellion in Libya.
But before this happened, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States troops had to be terminated.
On Tuesday, the Senate's International Relations Commission will decide on the observations supported by President John Kerry (Mass) together with Senator John McCain (Ariz) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn) in which it should congratulate the Libyans for their successful rebellion and US troops for "statutory".
"With this statement we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who began to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Two parties of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may look innocent, but no debate on Libya has been easy until now.
Over the years, the legislators on both sides were constantly arguing with the White House about the wording of a series of declarations for approval or, on the contrary, the refusal of the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of differences in the views of both political parties, so it was never voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that this proposal was rejected in the Chamber, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
By doing so, the US mission in Libya literally found itself in the legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama's mission was controlled, but apparently its members did not become so irritating that they would stop supporting him in his actions.
The weightlessness of the Congress finally preceded other events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August and was killed by Gaddafi on October 20.
The Nato mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The International Relations Commission in its statement "gratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tenacity, which they have spent to free their people" and "glorify the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population for extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
In the declaration "confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal be fully supported by the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators be redistributed into two halves, as was the case when approving the June proposal?
Against the latest version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), Chief Representative of the Republican Party in the Commission.
Lugar's spokesperson said he'd never seen the final version of the new proposal on Monday.
The House will vote this week on the amendment to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution concerning the budget or other subject on which the entire House or Senate will vote.
For the time being, the other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals to the vote themselves.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of 68 additions to the constitution, which were presented at the congress and touched a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal presented to the House and the Senate - and others are just minor changes to others.
Only in the House can there be at least 15 versions of the amendment on the balanced budget and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially starting Republicans, who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authority".
The revenue on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required that the House and the Senate vote on the amendment relating to the balanced budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration in support of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss a limited number of periods in which Congress members could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be the President.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) has offered a number of additions that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
A supplement prohibiting the marriage of couples of the same sex and an addition prohibiting the burning of the flag of a state remains a permanent proposal.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although it seems that the members of Congress are very active in designing various additions, they do not make much out of average compared to previous years.
At 111. Congress, 77 extras were offered, while at 100. Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales when compared to the early 1990s when, according to the Senate Library statistics, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current politicians.
The last addition, which was added - 27th amendment - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Caught, but not defeated," says Bifford in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was injured immediately by the shooter at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday evening, singing along with the melody from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and declared that more than a return to Congress was up for recovery.
The Giffords appeared on "20/20" at ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that creating sentences still gives her problems and needed help during walking.
The entire show documented its difficult recovery, which was necessary because of the bullet wound that broke through her skull in the front, penetrated the left half of her brain and came out of her head.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to the House to participate triumphably on the debt ceiling.
During her first television interview from the January shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, the Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, she replied to the 11-year-old Giffords, "All right."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly's astronaut, was part of the hourly special of the "20/20" series, which was broadcast on the eve of the release of this new book, called "Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope".
The specialist's been tracking the entire recovery of the Gifford since the shooting of January 8th.
In the videos that Kelly shot during the first week, you can see Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across the forehead.
While her husband is encouraging her, she can't do more than raise one or two fingers at that time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and teaching her how to carry out simple activities.
The bowing of the head.
Lip pulverizing.
And then, her first word is "What."
Within a few days, the Giffords said another word - " toast", when she applied for changes in her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show that the music played a major role for the recovery of the Biffords: The congresswoman sings on them along with a melody therapist to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview with Gifford, who spends two hours a day in therapy, Sawyer told her she didn't remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said the Giffords read newspaper articles about shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who was the six who was killed at the incident.
The shooting is suspected by Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in the Missouri prison, where under the influence of violent medication is waiting for trial.
"A lot of people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Woeful, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point his wife said during the convalescence, "I lost."
"So I said to her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," described Kelly.
"You just got beat up.
But you'll do it, you'll get back together, and you'll come back even stronger than ever."
Military units meet compassion rather than respect
The event was a gala evening on Wall Street, which brought out millions of dollars for war veterans in New York, who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
There were hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines around him.
Famously dressed the crowd rose up and applauded eagerly.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who held the spring benefit.
In addition to that, Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of the military forces, was a bit different.
"They were all introduced as orphans," wrote an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought it right.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respectable.
So the opposite impressions merely illustrate the light relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The military is barrenly praised for its victims.
But these praises cost something, say soldiers.
The public's acting more and more like they're feeling sorry for the individual in uniform.
"We're not a victim at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who was in command of the units in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us into the role of unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or ruin their relationship with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that had had to face the forces returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the words of pity are spoken in silence and in private among war veterans.
When the two sons of the retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat events, where they served as members of the Marine Infantry, their father warned them that they would watch their service outside the army from two angles.
From the point of view of some will feel respect and awe because they have defeated enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
Others, however, will be wondering if "a bad, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fights in Iraq and, after returning, took a place in Washington in the government.
He claimed that, when he was looking for work, some of the people who interviewed him were inconspicuously suggesting whether he could resist the stress associated with the work in Washington so soon after he returned to combat.
"If you talk about your ministry, you have to count on negative reactions," he taught his sons Cancian.
Military concern partly stems from American indifference to wars.
Successes in the battlefield will rarely reap recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army, and in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan there is little of its own benefit.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as it used to be in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who was in charge of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of events they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing growing pressure to intervene hard against rape
This week, 28 women and men against the army will decide whether or not to initiate the trial because of alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, they're prepared to file a lawsuit with hundreds of other applicants.
Private's first class, Elizabeth Lyman, was the night she was reportedly raped by her army mate, 25 years old, and she was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was headed to the barracks on the air base Miramar north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, that they might drink a little in her room.
"I had a warning light on my head," Lyman described.
But the native Texan totally ignored her objection.
I thought, "No, he's 19."
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, a man passed over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18th, Lyman and 27 other existing or former military members will be waiting for a verdict that might have historical implications. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will go there to see if the charges against former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld will be brought before the court.
The charge states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the proliferation of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, Susan Burke's lawyer and the defendant had 17 members at the time. However, over the next few months, their number grew to 28 - 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military and that the army failed to investigate, punish, or prosecute, any prosecution for justice.
Burke says she's at the neck of the highest-ranking army commanders, because the problem is just starting with them.
"Armada is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to take action against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February she has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could become part of other complaints brought forward in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than bringing all the charges into this case - she put all the eggs in one basket, as she says herself - she will file actions in several different cases if it is necessary not to pressurize the pressure.
The defense defense defense team is headed by the U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his colleagues, gave an incentive to reject the case.
The legal documents that Newsweek has received are in detail disposing of the strategy of defence - in principle, the fact that the current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court order, called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries concern the military services of the defendant," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence has refused to comment on this matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is only a word word: in modern wars it is hard to find clearly given front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan wars, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly significant role, especially in communicating with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers fell between these wars - two thirds of them directly in combat.
It is time for modernization in the military, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the veteran seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit for four major military academys for alleged development of an atmosphere that promotes hatred for women.
Regardless of this, the nonprofit organization of American Vietnamese veterans gathers evidence for their action against the military. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "severe personality" which was reportedly found with rape victims to have an army pretext for their release - according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati, a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, is a completely common practice.
In December, the group had already put forward a motion against a state organisation for dealing with veterans, which was accused of discriminatory practices to be followed when processing aid applications by persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were put forward in Congress by a group of senators and Members from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for Preventing and Solving Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unannounced in most cases and, according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19 000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The report issued in March also discusses the level of criminal prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the military - half of them compared to the civil justice system.
The prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks only as the first in a number of traumas.
For example, Private First Class Lyman reported an alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after it was due.
During the night, she says she was asked to repeat the details of her rape to eleven different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She passed all the tests necessary to determine the rape, and in her bed the blood of the attacker was found - from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions as to whether she was in love with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were called to testify as witnesses in favor of an alleged offender who was finally exonerated.
"I remember the day the verdict was delivered," says Lyman.
"I had a feeling I'd give birth right there at the place - screaming I ran out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't his trial.
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with personality disorder, thereby calling her unfit to serve.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without entitlement to the service.
Whether the Lyman case and the other prosecutors move to the next stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law University.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to proceed to the next phase of the discussion."
But between them and the verdict stands the mentioned doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment she saw the light of the world.
I myself am a lifelong critic of Feres Doctrine Doctrine.
The military has been behind for decades because their responsibilities do not allow them to comply with the same level of motivational incentives and repugnant measures.
He adds, "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
The only way to change is if good people are willing to fight.
If not decided in the hearing to their advantage, Burkevoá, the lawyer of the defendants, will gather hundreds of other persons prepared to bring an action and will start working on other cases relating to this subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue, where reform will not come from," he says.
Or until we die, depending on what comes first.
The walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the murderous bickering that remained in Norway, took part in his first public hearing.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he was definitely not alone in cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack he spent a lot of time at the computer, chatted with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy--just go Facebook.
"We have realized that it is not at all difficult to get them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British research team, which concerned European digital populism.
The source of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, said Bartlett that scientists had enough to simply use advertising on the site and, with complete precision, determined the desired demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team has found half a million right-wing fans across Europe, and they have been focused on them and sent ad to them, but instead of inviting them to or offering them some dietary products, they have called on them to fill out a questionnaire asking questions about their level of education, their relationship with violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from over 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a whole new way of carrying out research," notes Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online right-wing supporters are all young men, who stimulate the growing level of immigration.
But on the other hand, "the ones who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the screen of computers."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use this site to study everything, from health problems to social trends hiding with state updates, contributions to walls and pressed "I like it".
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each day on average will provide three different data, which makes this social network literally "information supernova", which is worth developing many new research. The number of academic works in the name of which the word Facebook occurs increased from the state five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It used to be very difficult to identify people from the British National Party when you wanted to carry out a survey."
"You'd have to get to the side where they would never let you go," says Bartlett.
"This Facebook is tearing down-- you're just going straight to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify the social-health problem and avoid them.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren from the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who discussed their drunken performances on Facebook were much more threatened by the problem of alcoholism than the students who had been silent on this subject.
Moren proposes that peers monitor the website and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem cannot be solved if you can't diagnose it," said the newspaper Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children that we would otherwise not have had a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The information team has compiled statistics on the relationship status relationship and the day of Saint Valentine's Day, election participation in 2010 and the country's satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information they have had access to - online freedom advocates have long claimed that the site should make its information treasure available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend that is thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think that most users have thought that scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a 2006 study conducted by the public facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they're concerned, they've taken it so that there's information between them and their friends."
It is therefore also important to consider the question of methodology.
Even in research off-line there is no guarantee that the subject is absolutely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much information on profile and wall contributions is true.
"What you're saying on Facebook and what you're doing off Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebooks continue to remain the best possible tool for research.
"If you go to the real world and talk to real people, it's something you can't replace," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities still take place off-line."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik takes part in his first public hearing
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to two attacks, during which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway, during his first public hearing in Oslo, he described himself as a fighter of "defence".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among Norwegian Templar Knights," said the court where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because you have been given a mandate by an organization supporting the ideology of hate and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I do not plead guilty to them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could declare his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought in the prepared speech, to address his victims' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for the next 12 weeks, to prohibit any contact with the media for four weeks and to announce that the competent authorities will have full control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some have come in the hope that they will be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that he is kept firmly under lock.
They all participated to move the case to early closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said the NRK commentator one of the survivors.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can tell for myself that after I saw and heard a suspect, I had gone a little further mentally."
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. When coming and leaving the building without any difficulty looking the present journalismists and surviving in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he is part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge admitted that he was not mad, and noted that there was no evidence that he had an accomplice.
For someone it may be a comfort that the attacks from June 22 seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she had fallen like a creature, but it is not," said one of the victims' relatives.
"If I had, everything would have been a lot easier."
7 lessons from the lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie going to the movies this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5, the views of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear and chose him as his genius the greatest modern inventor.
At a recent rediscovered Job's interview, which was dusted for a special movie that is going to the movies this week, the fact will be for all Apple fans that his creative mind has perfectly understood the business processes and the workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who likes every detail - believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the assumption that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent product there is still a long way to work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on a TV series of Triumph computer fools, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the shooting there was a unique, more than an hourly interview.
By that time it has been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had full hands to work with his new computer company NeXT, and he looked patiently at how wide the public would accept the Internet.
In the TV show, only a short part of the whole Cringely interview was used, and the original copies of the interviews were traditional that they were lost in the transport.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, the VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly trimmed, that forms the basis of a 68-minute film by Steve Jobs: The lost interview that is heading for selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has known his reluctance to provide longer conversations, Jobs is surprisingly excited that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
He also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it can be seen that Jobs is perfectly considering the answer to be as precise and precise as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism is coming to the surface, when Cringely’s problems are causing him to become impatient and move him to get into more important problems and topics more quickly.
The interview was made before the Pixar era, iPod or iPhone, and it shows up as scary prophetic thoughts when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read the postmortem reviews of Jobs' career, but there is something raw and inspiring about Jobs, which we see here as a eager dreamer in the bloom of his genius.
He has his own vision of how things could and should look like.
It did not take long, and after he spoke his mind, he also began to put it into practice.
Quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost Review, which is worth noticing:
How he learned to run the business:
I always asked, "Why are you doing this?" and the answer was always the same: well, that's just how you do it."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, never thinking about business stuff.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing its efforts to simplify Apple accounts.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - they often started with the inscription "standard costs", about their amount he could only assume. At that point he decided to go his own way - developed an automatic tool which guaranteed that they could determine the commercial costs within a few moments.
How he made a plant on the Pope:
Jobs recalls the Blue Box that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to hack into a phone company effectively and call anywhere in the world for free.
The device has already been written about in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm, when Blue Box describes as a tool of power, is literally contagious.
They tell how they tested with Wozniak devices using a pay phone and were able to switch from one AT&T network to another, while using as many satellites as possible during the call.
"At least half a dozen times we went around the world like this, so when we screamed at a pay phone, it got a call a minute later from the other phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young, and we found out that we could build ourselves a thing that is capable of managing infrastructure for billions of dollars worldwide."
We made a tiny little thing ourselves that could control a much larger giant - it was an incredible experience, and I think Apple would never have been established without it.
Jobs continued with a description of the joke that nearly reached the end with Wozniak. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night they called to the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, making the best of it as Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called up to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before the Pope himself had even woken up to the phone, the couple were soaked and the earpiece was placed.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs already had a secured summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a company was and how it was supposed to treat its employees.
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer that was ever made".
He was big as a trunk, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him immediately.
As a teenager, I was moving higher and higher in HP, hanging around that computer, and I started writing programs for him.
How he creates innovation:
In several places Jobs talks during the interview about how he's developing new products for running.
At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a few boards with platform connections, one customer asked him to build up a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days at his disposal, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
Later, when he was at Apple, he remembers the problems they faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember how we had a pretty wild fight... screaming at me that it would take me five years to [set up a mouse that would cost $300] when I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies breathe:
A long time ago, when he had led Apple’s resurrection, Jobs presumptuously foretold that many industrial leaders in their vision are engulfing and losing their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what else?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so society can no longer be more successful.
At that point, the rectum and marketing are in control of the company, so the people who are in charge of this, while the people who are in charge of their own products, are being stuffed out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led society to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned literally the entire computer industry.
She could've been ten times bigger than that, she could've been Microsoft of the '90s...
But instead of winning, they made money.
How to take innovation as a form of art:
"I have a great idea and a great product is a long way to go and a lot of work... and how the great idea is developing, so it's changing and growing."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to compromise a number of things - some things just don't make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, it depends on the taste - you try to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a certain way you try to project them into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed to rob the best of ideas.
Macintosh was so wonderful and successful because the people who worked in it were outstanding musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and coincidences also the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they'd be able to do amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Health Act at the time when their case was dealt with by the court
On the day when the Supreme Court was sitting behind closed doors to discuss politically controversial questions about whether it would accept an objection to President Obama's medical law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a formal dinner sponsored by a law firm to attend the hearing.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges gathered to discuss the proposals.
One of the cases examined was the complaint brought by 26 countries questioning the radical reprocessing of medical care that Congress approved last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the action. However, in March, a 5,5-hour hearing is expected, the result of which will also be further developed by the presidential elections scheduled for 2012 and will be in full effect at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who stands before the court and tries to achieve the rejection of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Attorney General under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, which has been defending conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations questioning the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the trial.
Dinner was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial discussion on the subject.
He participated, among others, also Mitch McConnell, the Supreme Representative of the Republicans in the Senate and the confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And bring in the guests, Scalia and Thomas.
This couple of judges have been participating in the Federalist Society for years.
And it's definitely nothing that runs counter to ethics rules.
In fact, these judges are exempted from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct which are subject to lower federal judges.
If not, however, their behaviour would certainly fall under the principle of C4, which says that "the judge may participate in actions which are precisely related and other organisations to obtain funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honest guest, or be included in the programme of the action."
Nevertheless, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas to two law firms operating in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in this case, was sufficient to alert activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claim of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Case.
"Judges drank and had dinner at the social benefit with lawyers waiting to discuss their case in court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines their feet with all claims of unbiasedness, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little understanding of their critics and have told them that they also have no problem combining their judicial obligations with group actions such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas Ginni's wife is a highly built conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives argue that judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia have an ethical problem with Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Attorney General under President Obama's rule when the first objections against the law appeared before the court.
Critics of Kagan are pushing her to abandon her involvement in the case, and they claim that she fought for the law so much as she could now be unbiased.
Kagan didn't indicate she was going to resign.
Boeing won a record contract on jet aircraft worth USD 18 billion
The Emirates are ordering 50 Boeing 777 double cable aircraft with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which more than USD 1 billion is recovered.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of their products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
But if this company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the price of these 50 aircraft makes up a record $18 billion, it's something else.
The same important news is where Boeing got the contract: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to the forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago Company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 billion in the next 20 years.
The Boeing company announced its biggest order in history regarding the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 double-deep Boeings 777.
A sensational contract came from United Arab Emirates based in Dubai.
Boeing at the 2011 Dubai Air Show reported that airlines have the option to purchase more than 20 aircraft, which would allow the total value of the contract to rise to USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which boasts much better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the whole company Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to those nations that carry oil.
This means that not only do they have money to pay aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - mostly harmful airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive because the country itself makes money at higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to an increase in fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The United Arab Emirates contract strengthens Boeing’s leading position on the wide-body aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS to its narrowest models, which wanted to try to disrupt Boeing’s dominant position with its A350 transport model.
The victory of Boeing comes four months after Airbus representatives have announced that the first flight of their largest aircraft A350 will be postponed, which is a direct competitor of the 777-300ER.
The withdrawal took place because customers required a greater useful load on the aircraft and the landing, so the manufacturer took time to provide the machine with more power.
The price of Boeing Co's events increased by 1.5% to 67.94 USD.
The sister of the Mexican president was apparently defeated in the Michoacan elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of PRI, helped drug dealers in pursuit of the governor's chair.
It seems that Felipe Calderon's sister lost the position of governor in Michoacan in violent state elections. On Monday, she declared that one of her opponents had helped drug dealers to win.
Preliminary results have been awarded by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to Faust Vallej, in the governorial elections of the Western State.
"The involvement of members of organised crime in the entire electoral process and, in particular, until yesterday's election, it is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our country as a whole," said Luisa Maria Calderon in an interview for the radio on the day after Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion study group... confiscated the polls, built roadblocks... and let people vote for PRI.
The PRI Party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until 2000 when it lost its Presidency.
It plans, however, to return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacán in this effort is an important step.
The PRI party hopes to win in July in the presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who was only very close to leading the day before the election.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative party of her brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejoon as a winner.
The third one was Silvano Aureolis, candidate for the left side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which had so far ruled the governor's office. To the disapprovement and unhappiness of the persecuted party, the presidential election in 2012 is a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to accept preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the State's capital, Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and encourages other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the native state of President Calderon and it is in Michoacán that started a military fight against traffickers in December 2006.
But violence endured.
The mayor of the PAN, Luisa Marie Calderon's supporter, was murdered only a week before the elections, and many candidates from the elections of fear resigned.
However, whatever the outcome of the elections in Michoacán looks like to the PRI side, the victory of the party will help to get a new impulse.
The expected PRI party representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Wahington Vallej and said, "I think this victory might be very encouraging given the coming year."
The Bank of ADB invites Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Bank of Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be prepared to help save the Eurozone from its major debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall decline in the global economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of the economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, General Manager of Bank ADB, based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the currency block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned against the fact that the States of Bric [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are watching all European difficulties "too relentlessly" and declared that Asian financial assistance combined with the European leadership and means will help to ignite the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So it is appropriate for anyone who can help Europe from the crisis," he said to the Financial Times during the interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asie may be protected to some extent, but she's definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been seriously tested for several months by a serious debt crisis.
In recent days Italy’s borrowing costs have increased dangerously, and both Italy and Greece’s Presidents have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that it could bring the global economy back into recession, and there has been a start in calling for the emerging economies to join together and help the Eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but he noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds by the Fund of Financial Assistance of the European Union, the European Financial Stability Institution - would provide more negotiating opportunities to the Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister for Trade, said that "India will do what it can to help the Eurozone, because her own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and drying up the presence of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's a bare fact, because as otherwise we could find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as those of India, have nothing to do with helping European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult for Europe to explain aid to 1.2 billion people in India when 800 million of them live from 2 USD or less per day.
"One might find that the Greeks retire in their 50s and enjoy their vacations on the beaches, which they might find difficult to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, the CEO of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why Indian stocks should be used to keep well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis would be "a dangerous dominance effect".
The bank's forecast that between 2011/2012 and 7.5% of economic growth in Asia is now facing the "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He declared that vulnerable emerging markets must create "unforeseeable spending plans" in order to protect themselves from the decline and significant outflow of capital from their economies.
Pentagon warning on possible defence cuts
The Minister of Defence Leon Panetta added well under the boiler on Monday in Congress when he warned that the rising automatic cuts in the budget could jeopardise national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a $450 billion reduction in the budget in the next ten years, but now it fears a further $600 billion reduction if Congress fails to conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," wrote Panetta in a letter to Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called suspension will cause 23% of the flat-rate decline and halt of many new projects.
"With such a huge reduction, used in this indiscreet way, it will not be possible to perform most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of the building or the ship. Moreover, there could be serious damage to further modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civil servants, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also have to send almost certainly civilians on forced leave to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care about our army and seriously damage her preparedness."
In the end, the cuts will be affected by combat troops, announced Panetta.
"Although the accounts for financing possible overseas war operations will not be touched directly, the operations will be negatively affected by major changes in the other budgets," said Panetta.
"There will also be cuts in contract staff, which will result in delays in agreed contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"The situation of paid employees will be reduced, which will also result in late payments to suppliers and subsequent distortions of legal and political support."
Both Senators wrote off Panett ten days ago and asked him for details of possible effects on automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a break at the Ministry of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly opposed to this heavy measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"The cut-offs are a threat to the United States' national security, which we should not allow."
"It will only be seen if Panett's letter and fresh warning will increase the pressure on Congress's approving budget and strengthen the voices calling for the pentagon to be left out of the list of excluded areas.
Panetta has recently been more open in interviews about possible cuts, even though he himself has moved to his high position in the Pentagon with years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a tough fight.
At the press conference held a minute of the week, the Minister of Defence suggested a brief picture of what his resort might expect - the shell of the army, which will, however, be missing the core.
"He'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like a brigade without ammo."
"He'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who could complete the mission," said Panetta at the beginning of the speech at the Pentagon.
"He will be as a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to deal with a possible enemy."
"As a result, she will welcome aggression..."
In the Annex to the letter to McCain and Graham Panetta specify how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on the possibility of landings and deployment around the world; anticipated unacceptable risks in future combat operations."
Pantta added that some of the greatest defense projects could have been completed, including those already tested, and those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the F35 project, the planned new bomber, the ballistic submarines of the new generation, the new coastal battleships and the new ground fighting vehicle, which the army and the marine infantry wanted to replace Humvee.
By stopping further development and testing of the F35 aircraft, 80 billion dollars would be saved in the next ten years, but its supporters argue that this is a necessary further step in improving the army that needs to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A look at recent headlines suggests how serious and ubiquitous lies and deceptions in everyday life are.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy with the charge that he sexually harassed several women - both parties claim that the other one is lying.
The administrators at Penn State were accused of perjury when they were trying to hide records of the fact that the guest football coach sexually assaulted the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on a microphone called American President Barrack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
A lie could destroy all careers and cloud the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately disproved by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of using his campaign's finances to try to cover up his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that pulled past Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in his function as his sexual involvement with Monica Lewiński.
It's just a bunch of stories about cheating at school and at university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to look good in their own opinions.
Mentors who should teach the contrary are sending a message that lies and fraud is acceptable.
How many frauds do we meet?
Studies indicate that on one day you will lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers had failed three times in the first ten minutes of their first encounter.
The determination of lies, or "recognition of lies," is a necessary skill that everyone should adopt, for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, say, to Charade, when one shouts, "I have you." Recognising deception is a serious science industry working with scientific data collected at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths of lies have been thrown out.
The liars are looking you in the eye.
It's not like they're shaking, stuttering, reddishing, or sulking.
Of course, do not imply that it is somehow difficult to spot and reveal liars.
The trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the sentence building, minor expressions in the face, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from a vast and emerging sector of lie recognition, and it is clear that revealing deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and, in today's difficult world, it can help you very much - especially if your work obligations include hiring, organising interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them be watchful, guide their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men who lie more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than to the free people (all the lies they say, most of them are "impulsive").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called initial observation.
He's going to give him a later discovery of what he's going to compare with.
Notice the possession of the subject's body, his laughter, his voice.
You should know if someone is knocking his legs all the time, so that you don't properly accuse him of lying just because he starts knocking his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the clusters of both verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But consider it only as warning signals, not as evidence of lies.
Lying people can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their imaginary story, the tip of the shoe can shoot at the door, turn to the exit, significantly change the possession of the body, or show "a relief after the end of the conversation" - an overly relieved breathing and change the position when it is difficult to confess behind them.
The interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what the relief will look like after the interview is over.
Also read the language of the subject.
The famous story is how Scott Peterson once denied himself and used his time when he claimed his murdered woman was alive, which ran a national search for her body.
The lying individuals can also express themselves in proportion: "I had no sexual relationship with this lady... Miss Lewiński" or the difficult question repeats the whole.
The most common verbal characters are only very small.
Someone can use a lot of "relieving language" when they answer the difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best knowledge."
In that answer, we will not know too much of the facts, and it is often another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to learn the skills that lie can be used.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of not flying a liar and a cheat in his personal and work.
The Controversial Plan for the Construction of Oil Pipes will be redirected after the threat of deferral by the US Government
A few days after Obama's government threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which led the unions against each other, but calmed down environmentalists - the company that built the pipelines in charge announced that it was willing to redirect the project to put things back into motion.
On Monday evening, TransCanada announced that it would move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska and is convinced that the project will be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska Government.
TransCanada Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead to a different route.
This notification came after the Foreign Office declared last week to postpone the decision on the federal authorisation of the project, from which it will not conduct studies of possible replacement routes, which would allow it not to intervene in the area of Sandhills in Nebraska and in the water layer of Ogalala, a vast underground water supply plant.
"This is really a move forward," said Mayor Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
A new environmental report ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably rescind any decision until 2013, i.e. one year after the next year's elections, but the authorities refuse to play any role in the decision.
Obama described the decision as a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in his written statement last week and expressed his support.
1 700 miles long pipe will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From Albert's province to the refineries in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil flow daily.
6 states will need to be cut this way.
This project completely hates environmentalists, but it is loved by work platoons, which estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear during the pipeline work.
However, the Nebraska legislators opposed this plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and in the water-based layer of Ogalla, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study, which was ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but the source from the energy industry said that the General Inspector from the Ministry ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study and focused mainly on two questions.
Once upon a time, whether the lobbyist hired TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to Hillary Clinton, did not represent a conflict of interest in the programme.
Next, whether the company that was hired to carry out the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of throwing up fear for her.
New York's family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the vestibule of their Manhattan house and scared their daughter so much that she threw up.
The performance of the hit singer "Lady Marmalade" spooked the 18-month Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "changes of personality, disorder of sleep" and "accident fear of strangers," claims her family in a lawsuit brought to Manhattan's Supreme Court.
Last November, Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were planning a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car, Roseanna Monk met her luggage down to the lobby of their house in Riverside Boulevard and brought Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a while and put the baby away for a while.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "You know what your daughter's doing?" I said "yes" and I went to pick her up."
LaBelle was irritating the pregnant woman.
"With an aggressive tone, she said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got angry and started talking dirty - screaming loudly the meanest words...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she started giving me water.
He says Genevieve's had a hysterical attack.
"I told the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter."
LaBelle, who still had Genevieve in her arms, had to stop her when her companion, who later dragged her into a waiting car, told Roseanna Monk.
In the meantime, the daughter screamed so much when she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter asking for an apology from LaBelle, but they did not get any answers.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokesperson are not responding to our calls to express themselves to the whole case.
The prosecution calls for an unexplained compensation, but the family attorney, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken up for free and that the family was planning to spend all the money it had given to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to get Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old in his arms."
Climate change has slowed down the economy
During the first year of government, Maria Lópeze Valdez increased unemployment and instability in Sinaloa, foreign investment and the economy decreased
The year 2011 will be recorded in Sinaloa's economic history. It is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, which is called the Government of Change. This government brought great expectations in terms of economic progress, but due to adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year there was no growth and even a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the growth potential of the state economy, with a 3.6% reduction in economic activity in the first semester of this year, with a historical decline of 31.16% in agriculture, which has affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Rural Development Council, damage was recorded on 582 835 hectares of the cultivated land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed and partial damage was found on the remaining 21.07%. The main destroyed crops include vegetables, corn and games.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the State recorded an increase in the first three quarters. From January to March 55 053 inhabitants of the State of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing a unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August the average unemployment was further increased and reached 6.19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
For unemployment during the year in Sinaloa can be more factors. According to Gerard López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, it is possible to explain unemployment indirectly, based on the steps taken at public policy level.
"We are witnesses of rising unemployment, which is related to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the reduction of resources due to legislation approved by the Congress in relation to the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally entitle dollars, it is not easy to earn them, invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Stop Migration
López Cervantes stated that a demographic factor is also involved in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people who go abroad for work to the United States has fallen, and also because of the difficult entry and then also because these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job, so people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment grows," he said.
Insufficiency
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa also worsens because of the growing inconsistencies that prevail in terms of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the people employed in the State work without taking up social security benefits.
More features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and inconsistencies. In this administrative territory there are the lowest salaries from all over the country, as stated by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the State of Sinaloa was by September 5 352 peseta, deep below the national average, which runs at an amount of 7 375 pesetas.
Shortening of foreign direct investment
In 2011, the most significant decrease in foreign direct investment over the last 10 years was also recorded, according to the Ministry of Finance from January to June, at a direct foreign investment of $630 697, which represents a fall of 87.74% compared to the amount of $543 312 for the same period of the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government indicates an investment of 17 280 million pesetas per year.
Debt
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government asked the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million peso. Until November, no debt gains were recorded, in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of government, Maria López Valdés, pointed out the lack of governance skills.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the National Chamber of Transformative Industry, stated that in 2011 there was no alignment of the will of the individual sectors, including the government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been very small this year. We must work hard to recover the land that we lost this year. In 2012 we have to double our efforts, we lacked harmonisation of our efforts all and, in particular, the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better", he said.
The Slowness of the Economy
Loredo López said that events such as freezing at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its development and growth.
"A weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including freezing. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not quickly recover enough to restore the dynamics that would allow for an acceptable level of process, product and service movement. Therefore, at the end of the year, we found ourselves deeply below the expected forecasts," he said.
Redefinition of mission
According to Teodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employment Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"We are currently seeing that it is working. We believe that we need to prepare a long-term plan in which the objectives and economic direction of the State should be redefined, because it is important to mobilise all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
A Work That Is Before Us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better guide the efforts of the government.
"At present, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there has been some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to establish a long-term plan", he said.
He stated that the current administration had shown progress with regard to public policy management.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I think that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us", he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg of marijuana
The population of Callo was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fines for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor’s Office has informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was sentenced for a criminal offence of health threats, namely for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 during a walk in Cipriano Valdez Street, across from station 80 in the El Castillo District, Navozlo.
The dealer was in a truck of type pick up white color. In the car in the shelf he had a black bag and in the passenger's seat a small backpack. Soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, a man has remained available to the Judges of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the implementation of the legal effects of the offences.
Debt contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, Preservation of public places and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be brought to the end or that they will be very late due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development stated that if construction work has gone forward so far, the government is now at risk that the government will not be able to provide appropriate supplies that require more than 11 million peso for three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. Until then only the Federation and the city have added the funds, so it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of the projects.
"They are supposed to provide nearly 12 million, and even though the year has come to an end, we have not received anything at all. Even though we were already supposed to get a part in July", he said. "To avoid wasting time, we started and continued very well, but we lack money".
He stated that last year, the State failed to meet the relevant deliveries for the administration of Jesús Aguilara Padilla, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to cover more than 7 million which the State had not given them.
"We have already had the same thing in the previous six-year period, because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. In order to get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to raise resources to cover what the State failed to complete," explained.
In spite of the fact that there is a promise from the State officials concerning the transfer of these resources, he stated that an application had been sent to Armand Villarreal, the Secretary of Administration and Finance, in order to speed up the procedure and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we have not yet received a peso."
The Court of Justice approves 'the end of analogue transmission' in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of digital analogue signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of State (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action brought before the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the President's decree, which aims to speed up the so-called "disengagement of analogue signals" and to implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
The minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree that listed individual steps that would lead to the transition to Earth's digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was rejected, because the qualified majority of the eight votes needed for the court to express itself to the constitutionality or inconsistencies of the decree, which thus remains valid.
The motion of the judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all questions relating to radio and television is a matter reserved by the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in order to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described therein leading to the transition to digitisation.
The Ministerial meeting also decided to reject the action brought before the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the proposal, which is also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that federal enforcement could not structure through general rules of measures to prepare public administration.
"I do not think that, even if she did, this would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is a federal enforcement mandate that has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of digital analogue signals is one of the greatest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It believes that delaying the amendment would mean delaying the benefits of digitisation, which requires a decision on the public interest, since digitisation does not only have a technical dimension, but also "concerning economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these questions "require operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State. It includes a wide range of competences which the Constitution entrusts to the Government of the State".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical authorities at their disposal.
He stated that it was not possible for the government to introduce, to some extent, an unacceptable decree, which interferes with the area of Congress's powers, into the administration's area of compliance with laws prepared by legislative powers.
In Michoacán, they analyze the ability to add "voice by voice"
According to the figures published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second positions in the governor's elections is less than 27 percent, so far 879 votes out of 6074 constituencies have not been calculated.
The possibility of adding 'voice-by-voice' appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, in accordance with the figures published by the Programme of Preliminary Election Results (PREP), the difference between the first and second positions in the governor's elections is less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been taken into account by 879 votes from the total 6074 constituencies.
In this context, the chairperson of the General Election Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a number of measures had been approved by the electoral authority a few days ago, on 9 November, which should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán officially did not confirm his political constitution or his State electoral code or the Law on electoral justice. The State Congress approved reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this parliamentary period was passed, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel neglected their publication within the time limit set in the Law of the Official State, with any objections against them.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) settled a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative powers and declared the voice of the Head of State in respect of constitutional reforms for "optional and illegal" because it had no right to "no approval or veto".
On the question of the possibility of adding a "voice-by-voice" María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council would allow the local electoral authority to carry out the partial and the total census.
In this way, a partial summary of votes, one or more electoral packages will be possible under the following conditions: the electoral results do not agree; there is no record of counting votes and calculating in the relevant field or the chairman does not have it available; or if errors and obvious violations of electoral results have occurred.
In addition, the total recalculation of votes in all electoral posts will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between a potential election winner and a second-place candidate is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request from a party representative appears at the beginning of the session and/or a coalition proposed by a candidate in the second place.
The total recalculation may also be carried out if, after proper addition, the difference between the likely winner and candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request from the political party whose candidate ended in second place, in which case the electoral packages for which a partial summary has been carried out will be eliminated.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to the PREP there is a difference between the first and the second place of less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 constituencies have not yet been added.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalnamé, confirmed by the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. On Monday there will be a ceremony and a mass of despicable.
According to the family, the Colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zepalinamé Mountains.
After his death with others, he received the highest honors, the Bacio Cortese family returned to Coahuila's capital on board the Mexican Air Force aircraft. The family and closest friends participated in the ceremony at Campo Marte.

According to her, the Colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire airport in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always went after his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto given Bacio to him remembers him as a very good man, "he had just come to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán on the graduation of his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in his best life: driving an airplane.
They've given him their last goodbye.
With Félip Bacio Cortés, a lieutenant of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that came to him to give up Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he exceled in both studies and sports.

Three abandoned dead bodies were found on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, the military officials presented 11 persons who were detained in this area for organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed by shooting into different parts of the body and the head were found in an abandoned village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The finding took place on a 1.5 km road from Cadereyta do Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
The people who moved in these places noticed that the cabin with beige coffee fence had open doors from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of approximately three metres, they noticed the dead bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One person wore a sporty t-shirt of yellow color and dark cotton pants and was not shoeed. A man was also lying next to him in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters further were the body of other people dressed in red sports shirts and blue cotton pants.
All three of them were facing the ground.
According to data obtained at locations, all three persons were probably killed in another location because they were not found.
On the fence of the cottages were found messages addressed by one group of organized crime second as well as a number of traces of bullets, both for the construction and for the doors.
11 suspects were arrested in Cadereyta
The Secrets of National Defence introduced 11 people, including youths who were members of the criminal group, who operated mainly in the Cadereyt area, associated with abductions, murders, persecution and illegal burial.
According to published information at the first attempt on 11 November at Los Alveros colony, eight people were arrested and one detained person was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured and confirmed to be members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
A further raid took place on 12 November at 6 pm. The military staff was on a tour in Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta when they noticed cars without the SPZ and in it two persons.
After stopping the car, they did a search, and they discovered one rifle, a casing, and 18 bullets.
Then, on the basis of these statements, on 13 November around 14 o'clock, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was arrested. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyt.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country above the abyss of economic disaster.
The Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country above the abyss of economic disaster and which has put the whole euro area at risk.
The Presidential Palace issued a report in which it announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet President Giorgia Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could create a government.
It is expected to introduce a government composed mostly of Technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti stated that he would present to the President the results of his conversations, which he led with political parties in an attempt to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase", said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that obstacles are overcome.
"The frame is now well marked", he added.
Monti has completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis that has made the debt rise to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Montim, must approve a hard package of austerity measures that require European leaders, which will only restore Italy's corrupt credibility.
Monti is under a lot of pressure to hurry, and due to market instability, BTP’s ten-year maturity interest on Italian bonds was exceeded, when Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian organization of employers Confindustria, told journalists after meeting with Monti: "We have said that we will support this government very much".
We believe that this government is the last option to get Italy out of this palpable situation.
Monti’s success hope has greatly increased thanks to the support from PDL Silvia Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are predestined for good results", she told the journalists Angelina Alphao, the secrets of the mid-routine party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant, because up to this point, a number of its members have stood up against the government with the technocratic majority, which Monti is building up.
Parliament support
The new Monti government must have strong support for Parliament to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in this effort could create a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has joined pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti opened negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth organisations and women on Monday.
The round ends on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President of Napoleon on Sunday, which allowed very rapid action to be taken in response to the crisis.
After a short decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond interest returned to critical borders, responding to uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister will reap success.
To save Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 trillion, would be beyond the current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti stated that his government should stand in power until the next elections planned for 2013, despite the general forecasts that claim that politicians would only give him time to implement reforms and then put forward early elections.
Monti said that he would like to include policies in his cabinet, but great parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties that the country has come into because of financial pressure.
Political sources indicated that bilateral distrust and disapproval between the parties make it difficult for both governments and political personalities to be incorporated into the government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten are going to cross the line of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side only one of the 22 called players reached the number 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side is compared by 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly game at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While world and European champions, the number one FIFA rating month, have a wide range of class A amongst selections, Costa Rica only has a defenseman Michael Uman, who played 50 international matches as the only one.
That number reached Rommel Fernández Stadium last Friday in a match against Panama.
Over a year, Spanish footballers who play in the first league of stars and in the powerful clubs of England maintain intensive activity at league champions and home championships and high-level matches within the European Cups such as Champions League.
To the previous one, we also need to add experience from the National Spanish Team in complicated elimination matches for the European and World Championships.
On the contrary, Costa Rica players have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, a Concaf, which is considered the lowest level in the FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish team has a goaltender Íker Casillas, who reached the former goaltender Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches last Saturday before England (loss 0-1 in London).
Casillas will also enter today against Costa Rica and gain a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches at his end.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week with other Spanish players who have 100 matches at their end. Among them already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and medium attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
One hundred were also closer to Carles Puyol with 97 matches.
Following Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and near Michael Uma move the left wing of Junior Díaz with 48 matches and goaltender Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 beat the limit of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azopheifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches there is Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Morale has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rica side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"Cesta on Costa Rica is a dream that becomes reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at National Stadium next Sunday.
We have waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself ensures that they can play on Costa Rica is a dream come true.
That's how the bassist said it and the founding member of Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent on tour on the occasion of the celebrations of twenty years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20.
This day he will perform from 7:30 a.m. at the National Stadium along with the angel group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a demonstration from an interview, which you can find the entire transcript on the web site of La Nación.
Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The path to Costa Rica is our dream, which becomes reality.
In South and Central America, we've barely been great for the second time and experience so far.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, and it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to be able to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally love the group here, fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your most slender supporters?
Thank you for standing with us for so long.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry it took us so long.
Some people already talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Is that causing more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've had in the past 21 years have been in the horizon for several weeks.
We've done some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that that's how we got into shape for the concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle. For both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surf friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or to Mexico. These are the best surf spots, and so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limitations we can't do.
We'll try to do the best possible show with various songs. We'll try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose what songs we'll play every night.
When we have two three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them, and we also have a surprise because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten.
So the show is more interesting to us, and that's why I think it's more interesting to people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic pathways.
If you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure you will.
First of all, I don't think any of us could imagine being in one big rock group and staying in it for over 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given, and we feel that we can continue to play together.
We love each other, and we like to make music.
We're lucky we can look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean for you to be a major part of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group in which the greats are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends, it does not happen very often.
From time to time, a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common to bring five to ten groups from one city at a time.
We're proud of it, and it's an honor to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with some of them.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and it is our honor that we can be part of this movement that was created in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and have the same members after these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the normal duration of the group.
First of all, I think we're all lucky that we're still in this world, and secondly, we're constantly interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and we have been able to open up musical paths that allow everyone sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we appreciate the music of others, and I don't think it could be any better.
Your relationship with the word glory was not easy. However, thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find your balance?
As we grew, it was gradually easier and easier to find a balance.
We try not to go too far on tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you'll remember that you must have music and what you've given her, and you can't be carried away by being famous rock stars.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something spectacular.
As a band, we existed for three years, and we never released any album until Andy died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy as he was incredible as I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as jumpers?
Yes, production sent us videos with several designs and we liked this group the most. That is why we are curious about what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always live change the words Yellow Led Better?
That's an Edie Vedder question, so I don't know.
He's singing it, and I think he's adding the first to attack it.
Who affects you as a bass player?
Lots of people.
I'm the first to think of Geezer Butler, John Entwitter, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I could talk about bass players all night who I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge alive, even though she's no longer in style?
I think we've always felt a little bit lightly separated from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I'll imagine a group that I referred to as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the other music that came along at the same time today, and if it's still valid today, it's something great, because it's music that's worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly cloudy character, and now it's more positive.
What is worth this change?
This is interesting because I feel that in the new album there are a few songs that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very dark, although they may sound positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and they were deeply dark songs.
I think that if you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from a family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent this to me.
I also think that you can be a happy man and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
The former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss in the area of the lower limbs, informed by his doctor.
72-year-old Fujimori, who has been serving 25 years of imprisonment for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), has suffered several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, for which he has been operated four times and is already under his control.
A member of Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, said to the TV station Canal N that Fujimori will undergo tests in the National Institute of neoplastic Diseases within three days, where they should find out why he hurts and why he loses the strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori might get mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not wish mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times for tongue cancer, he dropped 18 kilograms, and other problems included as severe erosion gastritis, cysts on pancreas, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, he named the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving punishment since September 2007 at the National Directorate for Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people killed by a murdering squad of troops operating illegally in the early years of his reign.
Mujica to visit Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the Uruguay president, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with her Mexican counterpart, Felip Calderón on Wednesday. It is the most important meeting of extensive visits to a full meeting with representatives of politics, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguay presidential office.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries", the Uruguayan presidential office published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Caldeks to support Uruguay in a dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkoza threatened that the countries that will continue to hold on to the position of tax havens will be eliminated from the international community, and this statement has given rise to a rejected opinion from Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
The G20 is a group composed of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. Since January this year, the Latin American country has had an agreement on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has been working to specify the fiscal exchange agreements in order to get from the "black letter" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which there are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a commercial point of view of Mexico and Uruguay, the FTA has since 2004 concluded a free trade agreement that has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
The Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach of the evil Bowser, but has not yet appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes this month into all stores around the world was already created to use all the characteristics that offer a portable Nintendo 3DS console that allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character that has to say how stereoscopy without glasses works," said a press worker specializing in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially created for this medium", because up to this point successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
spokesperson Nintendo said that in addition to the 3D film, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and continuous party.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can go into the "second round" on the levels of the game that are more demanding this time.
Furthermore, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and "do not subject to optical delusions".
This new launch of Super Maria in 3D also assumes the return of the character to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays in note to those who watch the saga and repeat the successful formula from previous parts. It is that the plumber of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in movements, around, in disguises and also among enemies, there will also appear "playful" Luigi.
Colom approved the issue of Portilla to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had made progress on the release of former President Alfons Portilla, who was to answer a conspiracy in the United States to launder $70 million.
This concludes the process aimed at Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country which requires Portilla to be given so that she can judge it.
At the Colom press conference, he confirmed that his decision was consistent with the independence of the judicial and executive authority and noted that the criminal court had already ordered the issue.
He assured that during his mandate he "not interfered" in judicial decisions and authorised all the editions he had received on his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for the murder and serious health injury and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloma's step means a step in recovery after all judicial and constitutional cases have been exhausted to lead a trial against the former president who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and will be guaranteed respect for human rights.
Portillo was found innocent in the matter of embezzlement of 120 million in the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency. This process preceded the release, but the Public Ministry appealed and returned the case to the game.
Trinive helped 6,000 young people in a state of emergency
The organization was created to help children without education so as not to be at the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of the Trinejov social support organisation is very important: 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion have been helped to overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this end, a long hundred jobs have to be added to this social group.
Last year's anniversary also served to introduce a balance in the framework of a solemn act that took place in the former manufacturing premises of Fabra and Coats, which was attended by over 300 people.
Trinives was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district to help young people with low education, without work, with drug addiction or where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organisations and institutions that have cooperated with the Association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Trinive.
Together with President Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist adviser to education, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current Eco-socialist councillor Ricard Goma participated in the event.
Fabra and Coats also visited the large hall of social welfare and family advisers, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the CEO of social work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinymove was created in a very difficult time and that today also presents a number of obstacles, but added that the work the association has brought to this day, "it is a good foundation".
The President has set Trinejova as an example of how it is possible to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not new for this organization and for the work it does," he said.
There was an eviction of a taken house in which giant parties were held
The intruders owned 11 of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 invaders left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All of this suggests that the nightmare that neighbors from number 51 lived on Balmes Street is finally over.
At noon yesterday, twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they were illegally living and where they organized giant parties that built neighbors, leaving the building from court without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to avoid repeating the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the administrator said.
The occupations who took 11 of the 13 flats in the building - the rest of them are inhabited - have taken all the electrical and partly water facilities, and they painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three flats there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and awakened other tenants.
Next to the building there is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that sales fell by 80% while the building was occupied.
The disco owner emphasises that the buyers of the building made her unfair competition because they were selling drinks for 3 euros, whereas it costs 10 on the disco.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment business had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors due to noise, but the problems were not caused by the visitors of the disco, but the residents of the taken-out house, and especially those who attended the organized parties, whose frequency and intensity have increased over the last few weeks, according to the angry inhabitants of the area.
The disco owner explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed with the owner of the building and had for nine months forgiven her rent.
The city police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors over the last few weeks.
The President of the People's Party Group at the City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week, called for "the building to be immediately evicted and thus end up with the problems of civil society suffered by its neighbours and the destruction of the area".
The president of the people explained that only one floor was taken the summer ago, but in the last months the occupations have reached all floors of the building and almost all apartments and even stolen in one of them.
In this respect, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent with the actions against civil liability in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 o'clock, the police got into building 35 on Mont-ral Street after the neighbors who saw four people enter the building.
All four of them were arrested immediately.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the process, which carries more than polemics about the fees.
The city selection procedure for 16 gates is again opening a debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid - 1980 ’ s, in the time of the biggest bloom, the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this government printed several pamphlets to support the Collserola park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park in the metropolitan of Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York Central Park.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many such as the top border of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the axis north - south, but up (top) - down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with the savages instead of the Yogi Bear.
This was the position until September when the town hall declared a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate records the idea of the park.
Either that, or someone's trying to put a gate in the field.
So is there one question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of organisation and in terms of reflection about the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already a topic as sharp as when two members of this old caste chosen in the meeting in the elevator will shake their hand.
And it was this work that led to one of the rare matches between what three Barcelonaian architects think and the presumptuous university professors.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayona: the tender is justified.
According to Roldan, after the issue of the Gulf side began, "it's necessary" to discuss also "the mountain side", so the presentation of Ildefons Cerd on green apples was not brought to the end.
"We must be based on the principle that the beach is the most extensive park in Barcelona.
Among other things, it's its great availability.
Collserola is more complex", said the architect, for whom the name "gate to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as defining zones where it is possible to operate".
Modol, like Roldan and Bayona, with the experience of urbanism, qualifys the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that presents "some dangers".
The dangers arising from "the uncertainty which today represents the public place project" following the experiences of the 80s, which in the Forum had "my swan singing".
The first concern is the definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"There is something to be defined means to take the next step", it is essentially to move on.
"The new urbanist and planning tools must be remembered, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster".
If we focus more specifically on the question, Modol considers that Collserola’s low slope can be considered as a park, but not a part of Barcelona, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also reminded that there is already a work carried out by the Patronat de Collserola, which "does not end in the trashyard", even though he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its gremium that it will intervene in the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, it understands that closeness to the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "disputes" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills") that must be created: "Architects should be only tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex, because there is no global vision of Collserola missing on the basis of the selection procedure: "A 16 selection procedure was announced, which deals with all axes of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that looks at the area and understands it as a whole".
This causes that at least he applied for all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the project of a single gate may be based on the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
In his opinion, the City Hall should ensure that the zone located directly above Ronda de Dalt should secure the entire length of the equipment zone, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino pardoned Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of incarceration, the legal attorney Cadino Red granted mercy to the brother of Mayor Monterrey in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larzabal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal attorney Casino Red granted him grace before the Second Criminal Court in that district, which discussed the case of extortion in which Mayor Monterrey's brother was accused.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos on which Manuel Jonas was to ask him to pay the economic quota to allow city hall in Monterrey to operate illegally in a betting house.
Following a public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office initiated a criminal prosecution of the brother of the Panist Mayor. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours before the Public Ministry Agent number 3, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antigua, the capital of the state.
At this point, the following 49 days have remained after the second incarceration order has been issued, and an agent of the Public Ministry has denied the possibility of participating or organised crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyt Criminal Court for suspected extortion of the owners of Casina Red by one and a half million peso. However, he remained in prison for a few hours with moderate supervision because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was given an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that nearly two months later the investigation had brought together enough evidence to prove Jonas' guilt.
On this Monday, the legal agent Casina Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region. On this basis, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal negotiations, a representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the partners had decided to grant mercy.
On the basis of an official file of 197/2011, the legal grace of Jonas Larrazábal is granted. In the process against him, there will be no complaint. It is also impossible to ask for compensation for damage or punishment.
After a trial with a legal attorney about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Breton.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yankee, came to San Nicolás de los Garza prison to tell Jonas that he had been granted the official grace and that his case had been postponed to the archives.
He also announced that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the air accident in which the secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, and seven other persons died.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident investigation, in which the secretary of government of Francisco Blake Mora died and seven others, showed that the helicopter had landed directly on the ground with full force without the pilot having the chance to attempt forced landing.
At the press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communication and Transport, the pilot stated that before the launch of the aircraft the flight allowed the climate conditions.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit has come into contact with the terrain several times, the wings have been involved in a branch of trees 25 meters from where the unit lost the hull."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons and therefore met all requirements for the transport of personnel.
Furthermore, he stated that no components were found on the ground on the basis of an investigation conducted in the area of impact.
"When searching it was found that parts of the aircraft were not in another place, therefore the aircraft hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, met all requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that it is at present the most important to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of airports and auxiliary services, stated that at the moment of impact, the helicopter of the President's General Staff was moving at a cruise rate and there was an accident on the soft uphill terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that it was a routine flight operation at the time of the accident," he said.
At the press conference, the representative of SCT Pérez Jácome named six basic points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, meaning that the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports state adequate take-off conditions, in line with this, the aircraft is moving towards the border, and between DF and the State of Mexico the clouds were visible at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouded crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility to the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last recording of the helicopter from the radar are congruent, it is likely that there has been no loss of control or disruption of the flight pathway before impact.
Distribution of aircraft remains in restricted territory:
The information that we are currently available allows us to assume that there has been an impact on a straight pathway and from the side.
The diagram of the dispersion of the remains of the aircraft suggests that at the time of impact on the mainland the helicopter was complete.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene that there was an explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work the remains of the aircraft were found at a height of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is weighed, the slope is from seven to 30 degrees.
Photographs show the footage that probably broke down along the route mentioned above.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter could get in touch with the country in several places.
After a thorough search in the vicinity of an accident, no remains of a helicopter were found in an area more extensive than the area of demarcation, which strengthens the assumption that the impact occurred in a state where the helicopter was still complete.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has launched a gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for the obesity of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it conducts research to reveal a gene that causes obesity in children and young people. The research called "Genetics of Obesity in Children and Youth" will allow for results on overweight.
In a report by the Head of the Research Medical Unit in Biochemistry from the Specialised Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team composed of doctors, nurses, nutrition professionals and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
People can come to IMSS sports centers in Valle de México, where youth tests will take place every 8 hours.
He stressed that research began at the Cuauhté Power Sports Centre (Mexico State) and since 8 October this activity was also carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Centre (Mexico State exit).
As soon as data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Centre (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the objective of this research is to identify the ingredients and the importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors on Mexican children and young people, thus preventing the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist area) are performed to all participants, blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, and genes are tested (it is designed to identify genes that contribute to the development of child obesity).
Cruz López said that this research reflects health care about the alarming increase in child weight.
'The health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that only 77% of the boys and 47% of the girls had been exposed to obesity in just six years. The dramatic increase also occurred in the case of overweight', said an IMSS expert.
He stated that one reason for finding indicators was that the people of the country differed from other populations by their genetic history.
He informed that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in genes that are responsible for developing diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general obesity genetics is commonly explained as inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they will receive a overall assessment of the state of their children, which will determine whether they have any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark-color wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm suggests the probability of a given individual suffering from metabolic problems and pre-diabetic conditions.
So far, information is confidential, doctors are giving it in writing to their parents and explaining to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they have to make in order to avoid their children's diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary way of life, meaning a lack of daily physical activity, full-day sitting before television and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
Overweight also causes large calorie intake, it is a greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and a genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no extracts in the asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Faculty of Chemicals, creates modified asphalt with polymers, creating a mixture that has better functionality, independent of climate conditions and temperature.
If it were to be properly taken care of, there would not be a need to correct nearly 200 000 extortions after each period of rain in the Metropolitan area of Valle de México, Raphael Herrera Najer, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemicals (FQ) of UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavings were adequate, there would be a significant limitation of the discards, or even could be completely removed.
In his lecture, the Technology Cause of Excesses, which he made during the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his leadership was developing modified asphaltes with polymers, thus creating a mixture of similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájer believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country, thus improving functionality and reducing the creation of discards.
He explained that asphalt, the most difficult part of oil, is the cluster of hydrocarbons, molecules with a large molecular mass called asphalts, and others with low molecular weights called lactics.
The viscoelastic character of asphalt lies in the fact that, at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it acts as fluid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity, and at 50 degrees it is almost in solid condition, while at low temperatures it tends to break, added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperatures, warned the expert on chemical engineering.
A scientist at the Faculty of Chemicals observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered by a flexible tile consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is an asphalt liner, made up of small stones covered in asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that makes up the insert is covered with asphalt.
When driving cars or while creating pressure, it is possible for forces in the pavement to break well.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would have broken down even better, according to a chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt insert, the last layer is called a coat, made up of fine stones, i.e. sand also covered in asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with vehicle rims, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt liner and must ensure road friction.
As a part of the paving will be subject to heavy loads, the coat must have sufficient thickness and be careful of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that must be remembered. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inside and it's hard to get out, it causes the softening of all layers of tiles and thus the formation of excavators.
He explained that during the production of the excavator, the film was the first to destroy the coat and then the asphalt insert was damaged. However, there is no damage at one moment, but it is a slow process that should be stopped at the first marks using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in creating excavators, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tiles must correspond to the loads of vehicles and must be guaranteed that this load will not exceed.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that, as far as asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, the asphalt emulsities that are already available in other countries, and they enable us to easily repair embodiments without having to use high temperatures.
What was the lack of a Valle candidate to become a new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramirez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus acquires the 14th title of the first multidiss.
Valle del Cauca has not reached the crown of Miss Colombia again.
Melina Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact that she was on the stage of the winners, won a silver crown and sherpa, on the basis of which she became the first multi-mission of Colombia.
Following the results of last night's finale in Cartagena, where she won and won Miss Atlántico, the department won the 14th title of the first multi-mission. Melina joined the crowds of women from Valle del Cauca, who had reached the winning crown, but in the end were announced the first multi-missions. Among them were Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
A question many people ask themselves.
The result is the defeat of the great favorite, which in all previous rounds showed that she has to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing became the Queen’s police and the prettiest face of Joile de Volgue. These titles have reached, for example, Talian Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which later won the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only the first multidissis is that it did not convince its answer to the question: "What book did you like most and why?", which Martín Murillo Gómez put down from the literary editor Leamos.
She replied to the question by the candidate:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I think it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was "the Little Prince", a very deep book.
I am currently reading "The Crime and Penalty." It is a book that is part of the world's literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book from Irene Nemirovsky, Russian author. It is a beautiful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer did not like the term "culturalize" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned had mentioned to her.
After the end of Melina’s solemn ceremony, she said that she was in peace and that she was happy for the outcome: “The world is wise what is to be done.
And you people, read, if you can, the little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorita position.
The Bogotian journalist indicated that the fact that the candidate was the most popular, most celebrated and the one that took away all the previous awards (Oster's Gastronomic Challenge, the public title for the best artistic dress and Queen's mother), raised the envy of other candidates, stressed the queen, who then burned down on the scene.
It was seen during the first presentation of swimwear on the Hilton beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Even though it was shining on both sides, it was known that she lacked the strength and the heat that brought the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "As Home" program at Canal RCN believes that Melinda has won the title of the first multidissis confirms the fact that the candidate, who will receive the most titles during the competition eventually does not go with the Queen's crown."
Moreover, Valle has held a rather unkind attitude towards the media in recent days and this has not been paid.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just at the edge, two days before the election, the international jury member Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In Miss Colombia the beauty of itself is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also speculative that candidate Valle lost points because of the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis that were evident on her back. However, this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernan Orozco, who is preparing queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with fibrosis on her buttocks, which in my opinion was not too noticeable, took her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos believes that the native of Valle made a mistake when she took several surgery.
"Surgeons are fine, but they didn't make it in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and here she chose her tax."
Because of this award, which was first awarded to the National Assembly of Beauty, there was a cruel prediction that came to pass after the show in the bathing suit. It was claimed that this was a satisfaction that Raymundo Melina had allowed so he would not have to finally grant her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina started the year of her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, he will enter into history as one of the queens, who, despite the overwhelming success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
That was the work of the Cali population who identified the dead body of Alfons Cana
An expert on Cali's fingerprints came into history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alphons Cana".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, last year an expert on fingerprints from CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader Farc: "Alphons Cana", through a comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department, this week, Eliazar González, a man from Puert Tejad, worked for 21 years in the field of judicial research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to a place where there were corpses that had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking the appropriate courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints.
The week that surgery against that Alfonsi Can was carried out, the Eliazars told him to take their clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmir.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. That's why they asked him to take the card with the fingerprints of Guillerm Leon Saenze (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the place where the corpse was located, he did not recognize him because of physical suspicion, but he looked completely different from the media.
He had no beard, dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much thinner.
But prints don't lie.
Along with the galton lupa, ink and transplanter, Eliazar’s light began to compare the body’s dactyl records with the card records.
The eye didn't disappoint him: it was "Alphonso Cano".
On the same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was charged with the defense minister Juan Carlos Pinzón, confirming whether it really was the highest commander of Farc.
Search for a stop
The recognition of President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the operational service against "Cano" is very important for the dactyloscopico from Sijan de Cali.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of a mistake that can play a key role in the decision making of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people are helping to investigate crimes such as theft or murder, and they confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they get caught, a lot of delinquents present fake documents or don't have papers at all.
We're gonna take their fingerprints, and we're looking for them in the database.
The investigator reported that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house because in this place the thief was leaning to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
Walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we could get a print of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or dissuade suspicions in the case of a murder.
They found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him recently.
The investigation found that one of the family members might be responsible for the murder and the bottle print actually confirmed it.
Although it's impossible to confirm he was a real killer, it's obvious he appeared on the scene of a crime.
The CTI fingerprint expert explained that the objects "reflected by chemical or physical reactive substances".
When they appear, a transplant or tape shall be used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Register.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are not stored anywhere," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Like everything that sparkles, it's not gold, it's not everything you touch that leaves a mark.
However, if it can be used, a corresponding comparison shall be made.
"Indignation" protests in New York
Hundreds of manifests were crammed in Zucotti Square, where they wanted to stand.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Wall Street Service were provoked on Tuesday, New York City, when they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square with a court order, where they were taken out in the morning, and then tried to take over another New York park.
Hundreds of manifests were distressed at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get to, thanks to a court order that allows the "mutilated" to return to the site. The second part of the movement responded to the decomposition by taking over the park in the north of the city, where there was further detention.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle with a view to returning to Zucotti, both through the assembly and peaceful manifestations," said one of the spokesmen of the "Cast Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray specified that the answer to the "indigenous" to the eviction of the camp, which was ordered by Mayor of New York himself, Michael Bloomberg, had reached the court, where Judge Lucy Billings had given a warrant against violent eviction and allowed the manifestos to continue to establish here.
In addition to the "indigenous" they took another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and the property of the parish in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour, they managed to take the place, but then the police came in and arrested some manifests, and Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said that he saw that the handcuffs had been put on by some journalists.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people were settled on the site, and a delegation of religious representatives came to express their support and also to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, is expected to be closed. It is expected that a court hearing that should take place on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the early evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the transferred manifests even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave it to members who were guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes", said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police officers beat the manifestos.
The court order forbids the authorities to move members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement, or to use "laws which were published after the call began, or to ban the manifestos from accessing the park with shops or other sites that previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg said to the press that, given this court order, the city suspended the re-opening of public space and the manifesto pointed out that local laws did not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city's Supreme Representative personally prevented the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which it was detained for 200 people and to which it was brought because the manifestos "infreduced the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it became "a place where people did not protest, but violate laws and in some cases harm others," because "some shops received threatening letters" and "the neighbors feared about the quality of their lives".
"The morning decomposition was horrifying and shows Bloomberg's efforts to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," said the spokesperson who accused the mayor that "he doesn't respect freedom of expression".
The representatives of the Ocupa Wall Street movement also stated that they were planning to organise "big events" for Thursday in cooperation with community and union organizations to remind them of two months after which protests were held, since they began on September 17th.
Pamela Anderson will introduce the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, he will appear on the television programme "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December.
Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", a wife of the yearbook musician Tommy Lee, and now an actress and a model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show in Canadian television.
Today, CTV's private television station announced that Anderson and the singer of sentimental songs Michael Bublé and other important Canadians will appear on the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV showed pictures from a television program in which Anderson, also known from internet home pornographic images, appears with her ex-husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary holding in a doll's loins representing Jesus.
As Josef appears on stage Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently served as moderator for the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Krome Anderson and Peters will appear on a special Christmas broadcast by CTV, a Canadian singer Bublé, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with an Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is close to the controversial.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian one of her concerts in New York City "a fox".
Japan is returning to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to household consumption and thus ends in the period of fall that started in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, now recovering from the devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that has had to face the country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have quantified material losses to $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global situation, heals well.
After three quarters of fall, the value of GDP between July and September came to such a position that it was possible to definitely turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan, the tax year begins in March 2012 - in addition, they predict the highest rate of growth compared to the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partially explained by the purchase of the machines necessary for the recovery of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, spending dropped by 0.9% compared to January to March. This is the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on an impulse that forces the crisis to take advantage of the crisis to come out of it or to restore infrastructure.
Japan has woken up, especially due to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma yenu
The flow was entrusted to the internal market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "saving values" for investors who are running from the debt crisis from the euro area and from the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but at the same time a great burden for exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, which is negative for the country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their weak results in July until September just the yen course.
While markets continue to be covered by the EU's peripheral countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda is prudent.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And the perspectives are not really encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that most Member States had clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
She dropped four tenths to 100,4 points compared to 100,8 in August.
The Eurozone even got below the average, which is at level 100. It reached level 99.13 points.
Athens again spreads uncertainty
Papadimos says that austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the rapid and risk-based marginal guarantees and uncertainty that has once again prevailed, Greece is becoming increasingly entangled in the labyrinth, leading to a major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "consistency" of the new transitional Greek government is given more to the demands of Brussels than to the true political power is being confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period of his appointment would probably be short for their application, the President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, stated that he would not support any new austerity measures and repeated his request for new elections on the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the October 26th summit", said Papadimos yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will culminate in the vote on government confidence tomorrow.
The package with 24 programmes to support employment, the reform of the Disciplinary Code of Officials and the new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the Samaras message does not clarify any doubts regarding his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have no longer committed to anything else."
The President of Conservatives went a little far in his speech to the EU address and the IMF. These organisations are to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently need, but he also stated that he would not support and sign any commitment to implementing the austerity measures.
Yesterday, the European Commission has stressed that its requirements are insurmountable: it does not block any assistance unless the new Government and the representatives of the main parties signify "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors from Troika will return "very soon" to Athens and will deal with the new government on "what needs to pay the sixth part" of 8 billion. The final date does not exist.
There's still a moment left to be confused about.
Queen Sofia: "There are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain "has reached an important position at global level as regards microfinance".
Yesterday, Queen Sofia reminded that the country has become the second planetary donor in the last two decades as regards this cooperation instrument, the essence of which is that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on human confidence.
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th Global Microloans Summit in Valladolid with the belief that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the objective of the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the goals to achieve a reduction of half the number of people who live with less than one dollar per day, i.e. the amount that sets the threshold of poverty".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in every corner of the planet and take this responsibility" stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" to which these loans are intended in particular.
"We have already achieved many" and "many challenges are still ahead."
The report on micro-loans should not only be a forum for discussion, but also a platform to support "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the objective is to ensure that 175 million poor families have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that 100 million families are above the poverty threshold they currently live under.
The concept of micro-loans has spread to Spain and to other countries of the world after the pioneer of Muhammad Yunus’s idea set out on this journey, the Queen said that it is a 'act of justice and the necessary recognition'.
The father of this instrument described her as "a wonderful idealist who went on the road to fight poverty". She met with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet her right on the spot with his loan policy.
Following this experience, others followed. The first worldwide summit in Washington and other meetings, such as the 1999 Côte d'Ivoire, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings I could conclude a constant development, explained the Queen, who yesterday earned the title of "the head of the family" in Valladolid, thanks to her support for this project.
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by calling on the participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions and thus enabling them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperatives"
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" which must be followed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to combine cooperation with developing countries only with the period of balhosy, because this cooperation is a "permanent duty".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever, governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, a micro-loan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The state secrets for international cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success, which celebrates a concept based on giving trust to the people to whom everyone else is closing the door. Mayor Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in the city, which "opens its gates to the spirit of solidarity which is contagious".
The CDU proposes to vote for the European President on the basis of general electoral law
Without serious difficulties for the Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel, the first day of the Christian-democratic Union Congress (CDU) Congress took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the programme, but it was not until autumn, in particular in order to satisfy the members of the parties who consider government policy today to be lax with the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow with the Italians.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine out of the 1001 delegates opposed and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes' ovation arose at the conclusion of Angela Merkel's performance, and then a few hours later Wolfgang Schäubel, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: the response to the crisis "not less Europe but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor in Europe, "the time of change has come."
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon, allowing the European Union's control of the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general electoral law "with a view to giving Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of a draft adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries will agree quickly at this revolutionary step: Britain is opposed and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position as well.
But the direction is out of the question.
Similarly, the delegates rejected a large majority of the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the Board of Directors of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of its economy, which clearly results in strengthening the weight of Germany.
The director made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she did not try to win congress by talking about "small" European states or states that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal for a Europe is devoted to one paragraph of the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What is a work incapacity fraud?
Following the aid, the UMP party and the government are launching an offensive against occupational incompetence.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will address the topic of the repeated fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased severity, but it is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on working incompetence.
First, due to budgetary savings, the government intends to force private sector workers on the fourth day of incapacity before they start taking aid in sickness.
Clearly, without the consent of the company, the employee who gets sick would lose four days of pay, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
Measures that risk causing a lot of bad blood, but that, according to Les Echos, could bring € 280 million.
Also measures that would be accompanied by further measures of symbolic range: to give state employees one day unpunished incapacity (unless they yet have any inability compared to three days in the private sector).
While these questions are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority also launches fraud issues focused this time on villains tied to working incompetences.
"The controls will be much more extensive and in addition: if you are caught, you will return", warned Xavier Bertrand during an interview with the station RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about injustices in working incapacity.
In fact, these have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and of the political pressure that brought their fruitage.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, in 2008 daily refunds represented 5% of health expenditure with their EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity contributions and accidents at work and 54% related to incapacity to work, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of health costs.
According to the Alma Consulting study, in 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 working days of incapacity compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average which hides certain derogations: another survey published in 2007 on Monster.com’s job opportunities pages showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees questioned replied that they had not chosen a working day.
Another study, this time carried out by sickness insurance institutions, specified that in 2010 37.8% of the incapacity to work was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% took longer.
When compared with their European neighbours, French workers are not more than prone to incapacity.
One long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence (for health or no reasons) in France was between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
The cheating in working incompetence represents only a very small part compared to working in black.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only small scales.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on incapacity for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM stated that at 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of 285,000 carried out due to short-term inability of "unauthorized or excessively long", i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacitys of more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorized" were counted to 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 'unauthorized' cases for several million employees who had incapacity.
A number that represents much less than the number expressing work in black.
According to Mr UMP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent between EUR 9 and 15 billion missing in the tax collection for the year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said these words before Parliament and added that a hundred days of unity given to his government would not be enough to fulfil this task.
"To put our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and the new rescue budget plan", said the Head of Government when he gave his first public speech on Wednesday at the opening of the debate on the vote on trust in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions adopted at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is in the game, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be around 9% of gross domestic product from now until the end of 2009 after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
On Monday, right-wing Antonis Samaras expressed his support for measures already approved in order to try to escape the debt crisis, but he pointed out that his party did not commit itself to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," said Samaras at his meeting with the Members for his side of New Democracy.
We have agreed to targets for reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economy and Currency, warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the measures envisaged, said Antonis Samaras that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the Committee of Experts
According to the report of the Royal Canadian Society, death is denied to the Canadians.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires that governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cases of cancer.
Canadian society is living in the idea of non-death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend criminal law in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice appears necessary for a patient considered competent to take such decisions.
In the beginning, experts quote a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked in 10th place, the study notes that "determination of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicine yes or no, 77% of the Canadians have no access to palliative care, they tell us experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home with most Canadians, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average is valid for the whole of Canada, while in Québec province this is the highest number with 86% of people who died in the hospital.
As regards the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicides, the authors of the reports come to the conclusion that they are going against the federal position of a government that has already said that there is nothing to change about euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also subject themselves to control of all countries where these approaches are legalised or are not considered to be a criminal case, there is no evidence that such criminalisation causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons who do not belong or disagree.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday in teleconference more than numerous cases of these maimings in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicides are not legalized.
"The euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians are inclined to euthanasia
It is recalled that according to an investigation by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of the Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that they will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending out a message that the life of old or hendipated persons is less valuable.
With regard to those who practice assisted suicide, 41% think that they should not be prosecuted.
In the case of maintenance or interruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, says the authors of the report.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not punishable.
The Commission of Experts also requires that professional doctors be educated to respect the obligation to refuse treatment at the end of their lives without fearing criminal prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires that governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final calming already widely used in Canadian health establishments, the Commission requires that it be considered, at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Exclusions of other experts
Some medical experts have already made their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report by experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of news experts as "extreme" because he does not restrict euthanasia to those who are ill in the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who was tired of life and who had more than 18 years could ask him to help commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied yesterday's report.
Mr Deschamps also underlines that it looks like the authors of the reports are building the autonomy of people above all other values that form the social fabric of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and limitations".
The medical specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strengthening objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as "a manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubtes in particular the data concerning the absence of doubt in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordan’s King invites President Assad to resign
Damascus's talking about "complot."
Syria is increasingly isolated
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad manifested yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria of President Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, resisted and spoke of "complon" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in Liza's Arab States, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, took an opinion in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordan King Abdullah II was yesterday the first king of the Arab State who called on President Bashar al-Assad to kill in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the military forces of the regime were killed,"he passed power."
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to give a demise, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of the Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, the neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, said that the efforts made by the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year were not crowned by success.
"The people who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said with reference to the neighbouring Syria, to which Turkey is applying an increasingly tougher line.
The United States rejoiced in "strengthening consensus against Assad and the dishonorable conduct of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Communities, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey are applying an ever harder tone" to repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As announced by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, during this period 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime killed in Deraa in the south of Syria.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed during the shooting and concentrated shooting from heavy machine guns in Jobar in the Homs area.
However, at the press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moullem estimated that the country "went out of the crisis".
In fact, he was also living in response to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus's membership, which, according to him, represents a "hazardous step".
Syria"will not bow," he added to the assurance that"complities in the fight against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering the mechanism of civil protection" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favourably in favour of sending UN observers in order to help protect civilians from repression of a regime that he thinks is "paranoid".
The new Special Meeting of the League is called on tomorrow to take an opinion on the resolution plan of the crisis, which was decided on December 2, and in which it was expected that the military should be removed from the cities affected by the dispute and the release of imprisoned manifests.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday considered the decision of the Arab League to be "failing", while China encouraged Syria to adopt a resolution plan, but to avoid any support for sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifices for the Italians
The next Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start implementing a program that will contain "arms" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of trade unions and employers today.
It should establish a relatively slim cabinet consisting of Technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke about an important programme with many victims", said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups attending the talks, after meeting with the designed Prime Minister.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament to speak up for confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness of the financial markets and asked them for time.
The "democracy pays precise terms" in terms of government preparation and its programme, stressed and added that "the markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment by the President was welcomed by the markets from the outset, but the concern re-emerged after the unexpected fall in September industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team involving, in particular, the Technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept "politics".
He expressed his conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranca Fini's new government will be given Parliament's trust by Friday.
Mario Monti, after taking up his duties, promised to act with extraordinary urgency and to make Italy a strong article again."
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesperson stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change with the new government".
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not reach its objective of balanced budget in 2013 and calls for new hard measures.
The head of the business union of Confindustria Emma Marcegagli, who meets Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to reinvigorate the economy"or a country that does not show growth cannot comply with the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the introductions, "a call for seriousness" and "other Italy", represents an epoch change" for Italy after 17 years"berlusconism".
The great unknown will be the life of his team.
President Napolitan would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place government bonds for EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
The Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used for an atomic weapon, reported an American non-governmental organization dedicated to nuclear risks on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (SIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents that have escaped from this UN agency.
Last week, the MASE reported its "serious concern" regarding the "if possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the Institute of ISIS, widely drawing on the documents of the MASE, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should work for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research centre in Čeljabinsk (Ural), where he should deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, the Centre was to leave to set up a "nana-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was then to cooperate on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In his latest report, the MASE recalls the clear fact that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist, who not only knew this method well, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked during a substantial part of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of the country where he came from".
Anti-Muslim crime and delinquency increased by 50%.
According to the FBI's statistics published on Monday, the number of criminal acts and delinquents directed against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly or little rose.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase compared to the procedure by 13% in Catholic violence, a fall of 4% in Jews' violations and a total increase of 14% in religious crime and delinquency.
The total number of "inviolable criminal acts" was very easy to increase to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences according to the FBI and 20% by religious differences.
"After the loss in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and delinquents rise again", stressed Human rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly important", the organization added in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hateful crime, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds Paul Legendre, one of the leaders.
"The US government can and must do more to deal with these crimes", adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on "inviolable criminal acts".
The "inviolable criminal act" in American federal law is the legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin, and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and looks more like Facebook
The website providing microbloging services Twitter introduced changes in design on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of successors, which somewhat resembles its Facebook services.
New offers "action" and "name" allow you to know better and directly the activities of other persons who follow you or persons whose answers ("tweets") you follow.
This allows you to know whether they allow you to monitor the contributions, whether they apply to new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested"in August at a small percentage of users" before it was expanded to the entire network, said the AFP spokesperson of Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with deadlines somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the redistribution of contributions from someone else, followfriday pour recommender de suivre un arure utiliseur) faisant le bonheur des inities, s'uvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celi des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately assess the importance of this innovation in their "tweets".
"It's unnecessary, it takes a lot of space, and it's too Facebook-like," writes @jemb123.
"Function Activities will better help me to watch some of the elements of my Twitter", sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
entering the Golden Rule on Balanced Budget into the Constitution
The Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, held in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to enter the "Golden Rule" of Budgetary Policy into the Constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid any reduction in the rating of Austria by credit rating agencies (AA).
He was himself a socio-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced this decision at the conclusion of a ministerial meeting in a situation where the Austrian public debt is, with its 74.6% high above the criteria, a maximum of 60% of those laid down by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than those of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by just one single degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay by three billion more euros each year" argued the multi chancellor and Foreign Minister, the Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus follows up on the request of the summit of euro area countries held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where Heads of State and Government strongly requested that public deficits be reduced by the end of 2012 and that public accounts be balanced in the Constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "regulation".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product each year and, starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not have to be above 0,35% of GDP each year, while the federal countries and municipalities will have to report a balanced budget.
The objective is to get public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty in the period 2020/21.
Strong only
Noda is in danger of new interventions in foreign exchange markets
On Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again on foreign exchange markets if he had only to continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene, as we have done the last time, if we find too much instability" in the exchange rate just explained to Chamber Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, he only rose again to the historical values that the Japanese authorities forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently exceeded the dollar record in force since 1945.
But only since then has it been regularly promoted by purchases of investors who consider it a "safe port" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar again came under 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell under the symbolic bar of 105 yen near the level that caused the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This fluctuation of Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports because it is increasing the price of Made in Japan and reducing the value of the proceeds obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when transferred to domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami wave that destroyed the Tohoku region in the north-east of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this healing would not yet kill in the eggs of fragile recovery.
The third economic power of the world has restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% relative to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to a survey on exports growth and household consumption charged with disaster.
But the Prime Minister considered that the high value was not merely reflected by the "national economy of Japan".
The Japanese finance minister Jun Azumi called on Japan’s Central Bank (BOJ), which launched a two-day meeting of her political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures to weaken justa.
But the multi-governary of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that the BoJ had already adopted "substantial measures" indicating that no additional monetary weakness could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Securities has increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euro) its purchases of Treasury bills and increased to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euro) the ceiling of the amounts devoted to the purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates are rising, storms are failing
The risk of a debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European stock exchange is still concerned about the stability of the euro area today, on Tuesday 15 November, is falling into negative expectations.
In Paris at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% on 3.064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and London is 0.1%.
"With new tensions around the yields of euro area loans in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to generate only a part of recent profits".
"Terror investors are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker, quoted by Reuters.
The storm in Tokyo was closing down with a fall of 0.7%, which she suffered because of the concerns of market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe, and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilised", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This relaunching of uncertainty about the future of the euro area harms the currency itself, which continues on Tuesday in its decline.
The euro has been getting to the lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency is $1.3570 at a retreat of 0.4%.
According to the currency brokers, he backed after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party accepted on Monday a proposal to withdraw from the euro area for countries that will find themselves in trouble without leaving the European Union.
Italy and Spain far beyond 6%
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain very worrying.
This morning, on Tuesday, the return of Italian 10-year bonds is 6.85% and the return of Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of South European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen the concerns of market participants.
The Head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded that the market be able to correct the situation in Italy, threatened by the amount of debt it owes.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is again in the intentional line of markets when the country is elected to the Chamber of Deputies on Sunday.
The rate difference ("read") between Germany and Spain's 10-year bonds reached a new historical maximum.
Expected euro area growth figures
Statistical figures say that France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter due mainly to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies of INSEE revised downwards by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And truthfully, it's the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
Germany registered growth by 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the whole euro area are expected at 11 o'clock, while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogma
If there is a topic that cannot be taken on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotion, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural for the election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development is about to double electricity demand by 2050 if we do not want a large part of the world's population to get rid of important parts of life.
At the same time, there will be a need to face the lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, and it is not necessary to forget the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, which is a subject which is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
An accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany itself remains in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find any other source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which it considers right only to build power stations of the last generation.
On the contrary, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue their commitment in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to extend its park by one unit by restoring the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts that.
The choice of Berlin will be shown by the improvement in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported from Russia, by the sharp increase in CO2 emissions generated by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The Danish case deserves to be considered.
The European champion in wind power plants, which receives 30% of their electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas because of wind irregularness, which is why CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are 65% higher or 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the invariability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay 40% more for electricity than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised economy energy costs represent a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing industry's maintenance on national territory, French companies benefit from the most cheap electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make an illusory beautiful declaration of reindustrialisation of our country and defence of purchasing power.
The price that the large majority of French refuse to pay, just as it does not substantially oppose this energy, as is shown by public opinion surveys.
Let us remind you that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 follow-up jobs.
The highly exporting sector is leading to a large number of small and medium-sized job-makers that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have lost EUR 6 billion a year for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while its manufacturer would be planned to fail?
When solving the energy equation, it must be accepted that there is no magic source for energy production, or that there is no evil.
The development of low CO2-emission plants and renewable energy facilities by the French industrial group AREVA is evidenced by the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, the absolute necessity is to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Nuclear Safety Authority, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of the new Flamanville power plant.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, have an idea of blood security.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island took place under normal operation conditions and remained without human victims and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, drama caused the concept of a reactor and unforgivable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that accidents were the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident as it did in the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and constructors is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to ARVA and EDF’s competitors and easing the way to strengthen their leadership in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best solution to energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogma and machinations control the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from different angles - the police, courts and administration of the numbered policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "human rights" which France boasts.
Recently it was an administrative harassment whose object was foreign students, which became current when the Minister of Interior (see Libération of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, wallies and waitresses".
But so far, it has rarely been discussed under the economic angle.
It must be said that there is quite a broad agreement between the left and the right in this area.
On the right hand, Jacques Chirac stated that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where there are 2 million migrant workers" and on the left hand of Michel Rocard, when he said that in 1990 France" could not accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005 fear of invasion of hordes of Polish plumbers in the French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we are going to give to immigrants.
In his program François Hollande is limited to banalities when he says that joint development will enable our "migration problem" to be solved.
This idea of immigration as a burden and the problem may be true in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As reminded by the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definition Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): among the specialists there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries receiving immigrants.
The reduction of immigration is hampering growth and harming employment.
The concerns of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure on reducing their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more supplemental than substitutes for French employees by doing jobs in sectors with shortages of workers.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
A positive impact on wages
As the surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this addition between French and migrants makes the arrivals of immigrants a positive impact on the wages and employment of French workers.
Thus Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
At the same time, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of emigrants brought in contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalised immigrants among American Nobel prizers; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in Europe on average of 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation, for example, estimates that in Germany one immigrant will bring a net contribution (incomes minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 over the whole of her life (incomes minus expenditure) to the public budget.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his wish at the beginning of his mandate to go for the missing percentage of growth "with awarded teeth".
The changed teeth used to dissuade immigrants have just had the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, European democracy remains to be considered
Democracy is rare and very fragile.
The European continent should remember that, although he invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some people may have believed that in order for democracy to definitely triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to make the choice and make it as direct as possible.
However, it is known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
The general electoral right, although the necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient and can become a "repressive instrument" as once said the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of department and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been right since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The confession of the Greek referendum of the type will have the value of double disclosure in this respect: revealing the need for a great return of political power, but also revealing the worrying feeling of its inability, its incompetence.
This ambivalence must be thought out so that it can be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic order have moved today and that many of the Republican warriors no longer shoot in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we need a number of national referendums organised according to necessity and disorganized.
Bianko exposed to the European absolute monarch or jump with tied legs to an empty nationalist depth: what choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but common, full, peaceful and continuous performance of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not even know where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe leaning forward to the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its inability and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is a whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and each one of its nations.
The management of the European democratic sovereignty project should be urgently reinstated.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of the governments of the markets and invest in preparing the future.
The exit from the crisis will assume decisions at European level which will not be able to be adopted without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would bring us to disaster.
After we have long fought against this proposal by Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is demanding a European economic government.
Fair enough.
But to think about it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such, would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage in European building.
In order for the Republic to be established in France, it was necessary to "be" Republicans.
The revolution of interest couldn't have been enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building Europe more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Unconnected" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere it will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris a world chip card fair.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 should end with an increase in the world’s sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM phones) by 11% in more than 6 billion units.
The most carrier is a segment of contactless technology, which allows to pay in public transport or deal with purchases only by drawing the card closer to the reader.
This year should be sold around the world 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should rise in 2012 (a expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
After being long in thevolved APEC countries, Europe acquires terrain in non-connected pay.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals are receiving them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been issued.
But big chains work for two.
Carrefour thus issued 2.5 million unconnected Pass MasterCard cards this year.
In order to include a higher degree of speed, it is necessary that the bank is equipping its clients with them from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future to their customers a non-touched bank card", reports Gérard Nébuy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test their pay phone
But that's just the first stage in the future's means of payment: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required for the execution of transactions is now equipped with only a small number of instruments.
"They're late."
"But their true swing should take place next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their sales in the world of 80 to 120 million units", explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing forward.
The Bank of Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test carried out in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
iPhone devices of around 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with case-free payment.
The BPCE bank has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société générale announced yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay wirelessly.
The terrorism front ranges from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned with the alliances between Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
Long-term suspicion that there are alliances by the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algiers had been confident about it from now on.
"The way the two organisations operate, and intelligence reports show that there is a lot of cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analysis.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two French in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being abducted by members of the AQMI from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation conducted by special French troops.
In the rubble after the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phone calls with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorism axis
Analysis of calls made leads to several persons in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to Nigeria, who has long lived in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, which is a cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is known to be close to AQMI and a sect.
"It is progress, but it is no doubt necessary to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active", the mild statements of Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and demonstrations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which since include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices in the same way as those used by the AQMI.
Since then, the international community at the head of Washington has put pressure on Nigeria to consider the problems that Boko Haram has created.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened mystics of little good interest.
Fast success
The sect of Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, schools and fundamentalists of Mohammed Yusufa. Boko Haram, which means "Western Upbringing is sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a combination has a rapid success.
The sect is politicized and requires strict respect for Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters are launching a fight against the 'central government'.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, the supporters of Boko Haram became extremely active and multiplied their attacks against police stations.
The government's response is still the same as usual.
The army will surround the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of Mohammed Yusuf is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group is radicalizing and leaving its premises in the north.
At Christmas 2010, he will carry out an assassination in Jos, where 80 people will die, then others in the capital of Abaja.
In June, it is again in Abaja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead all security specialists from Mauritania to Somalia, from now on.
Now that Al-Qaida of Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the Iger and the Somalis of the Al-Shabab movement operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France is in a state of emergency and is ready to hand over all the information."
The world by candidate for president
As regards China, Iran, or Israel’s assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are pushing for simplification and ignorance.
Can America’s weakened crisis manage the world with simple or even simplified ideas?
When listening to presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated the noisy statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran, or the help of Israel come together.
Mitt Romney, the best positioning candidate in the Grand Old Party nomination race, threatened the Chinese's profession before the World Trade Organization and their accusations "for manipulating their currency", which is a carrier theme in America engulfed by migration of all parts of its industry towards Asia.
Even worse, if this must contain the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador to China, and the only candidate with any sophisticated vision of foreign policy, was almost in a state of staggering attitude that "smooths" emotions.
He called for a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is at the last places in the polls, remains disobedient.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'm going to jail Iran," he said in fanfaron.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel’s military aid by accusing Obama of disappointing his obligations toward this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-place candidate, shows awkward ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stand against the Chinese military threat because Beijing will try to develop nuclear capacity" - clearly unknown fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike Iran, says he's ready to send the American army to Mexico to fight against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
Everyone is far from being a Republican candidate, John McCain, in 2008, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They remind that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the rash departure of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus pin a weak sticker on him.
But the attack isn't easy.
The population is evaluating President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to stagnation.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama knocks on the right place.
Nord Stream, the new Russian gas port in Europe
The Nord Stream remote pipeline, directly connecting Eastern Europe to Russia and led by the bottom of the Baltic Sea, began to work.
It must provide gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, among them 4 Heads of State and Government, participated last Tuesday in the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new pipeline that will connect directly under the sea Russia and Germany.
symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together in control of the Russian gas supply control valve into the West European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cabin gas meters of Russian gas will flow every year through the 1 224 km connecting the St Petersburg region with the Federal Land of Mecklembourg-Pomorans.
The second pipe, which has to be completed at the end of 2012, will allow for the supply of a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equal to the total French consumption.
And it's already recalled the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and Baltic countries protested strongly against the project.
Nord Stream actually enables the supply of gas directly to Germany without being led by a third State (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats that it will close its access to the Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed it most clearly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that it is a politically sensitive topic.
With its support for this Russian project, Western Europe has gained greater confidence in its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project created cracks between the Eastern and West Europeans.
Russia managed to promote its vision of direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries with high gas consumption, whose bearings are nearing their end, just five years ago.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically links us", confirmed François Fillon at the ceremony of opening this pipeline and demonstrated at what point the major gas contracts of things are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of the leaders of Gazprom, who are present in the large number of Lubmin, the gas feeder.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The submarine pipe is of steel provided with a concrete shell in order to protect against the anchors of marine vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid minefields originating from World War II.
"For safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed", says Jens Müller, spokesperson of Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing 242 the Eiffel, which is not interrupted anywhere by valves or maintenance stations over its entire length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project manager rejected it when the Swedes were only a little eager to see the Russian state company, as it was permanently settled off their coasts.
"In the event of a failure, we will stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute", explains Jens Müller.
In the case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline shall be released into the air.
But this case is considered to be unlikely by the builder, for welds were designed to cause leakage once every 100,000 years.
The control of the external gas pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot towed ships, while the inside of the gas pipeline is controlled by a device that circulations inside.
This device of a cigar shape with a diameter of 1 m is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by the gas.
In the target, 3 m/s speed for all three days, it shall provide accurate information on possible distortions of metallic parts.
The remote gas pipeline was designed to function for 50 years without needing a minor repair.
Gas circulation is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar in the finish.
Five companies joined forces for the implementation of this project.
Gazprom, who holds 51%, remains in charge.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, commissioned by the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has its registered office in the town of Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely favourable.
Gazprom subsequently leased this company for five years by the Treaty which can be renewed, all its capacity for the transport of gas.
"Gazprom will profit from the overall capacity, whether the amount of real gas is any", explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was ensured by 30% of the shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be €7.4 billion for both pipes.
The investment costs for GDF Suez increased to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned to them, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
Gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
The vents are 4,5 metres high, forming the exit gate of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million Cuban meters of Russian gas every hour.
With full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - branded journal
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to re-provide the joy of writing.
It brings smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of the candle.
Moleskine is easily distinguishable by its black rectangle plates and its leaves with white colors as if aged in time.
After all, the diary of Moleskin, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to market a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, a consultant working for the company, is hereby accepted to introduce a new product.
The journal inspires the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of the skin), which is used e.g. for treatment of the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine returned to the popularity of the old and forgotten object, which was the icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", told Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leading person of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle for 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is a remote secret production from the first years when only 3,000 notebooks have been made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create an artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook takes on business as well as students or professionals.
The image of Moleskine is that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, has nearly one hundred of them today, and since 2008, it has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
It spreads its notebooks to the bookstores and through the FNAC chain of stores into small boutiques in the centers of cities where he knew how to enforce his identity.
"We followed the spirit of time and this need for a new writing, through the stormy development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the diary Moleskine: recently the brand opened the exhibition " Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarn Film Festival, she also introduced new records of the Leopard Notebook.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebook case ... The brand extends to a wide range of carriers.
A success that aroused envy: In autumn 2006 Modo Modo was purchased by investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syintina Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there such a high share of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today is the 15th week for hiring the disabled.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people is twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it daunting?
"No, it underlines the Éric Blanchet, the CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes a Week for hiring the hendipated."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the percentage of unemployed was not three times higher."
"There's still so much to do."
It should be said that many obstacles remain for unemployed hendicipated persons prior to their entry into work.
These are older people: 37% have been over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have graduation, and 2.3 million students of universities are only 10,000 hendipated.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in hendipated versus 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make the return to employment particularly difficult and which represent the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, the CEO of the Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992 to help businesses to accept hendipated workers.
So much for objective brakes.
Unsaid remains, ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slow.
The study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that questionable managers have a weak level of knowledge of hendipated persons" s"excessive idea of people in mobile chairs and mental or mental deficiencies".
The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees are far from achieving the objective of employing 6% of the disabled workers provided for in the 1987 Act.
The last known numbers, which came from 2008, indicate a state equal to 2.6%.
"We are now around 3% moving", says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agephiph, responsible for collecting fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The number of fined enterprises is evidence, as well as the amounts paid which have decreased between 2007 and 2011 from 59.000 more guilty to 46.000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 employees employ hendiped workers compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
"What luck"
Before Tuesday night (20h45) the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens would not hide the pleasure that would bring them this friendly match.
We're not going far enough to write that there was an association between them, but it's a symbolic picture.
Sitting next to each other at Stade de France’s auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, the Belgian coach brought only the words of praise to his player.
"I am very happy with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward", assures the player of the French Lille.
As far as the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches is concerned,"it is equally justified."
"I've been in Lille for a year, which is not a case with Belgium."
"It's necessary for me to clear my brand."
Hazarded against Romania on Thursday night because of this fight against France, He comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "light".
You can't forget the term "joy".
To play against Bleus, who has been encouraging since 7 years and in their winning campaign in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
That's more because across the street"are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)" reminds.
"We crossed now."
"I can play against them, it's just pleasure!"
Good-bye, Leekens reminded me of "shritis".
"Hour" to fight a match - a holiday."
"Prudence" also stated in the quality of the "neighborhood" that France became a very high-level team by a little more than a year after trauma in the South African city of Knysna".
"Laurent Blanc did a huge piece of work," he breathed.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European Championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself on a flight with the French in 2014... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he underlined.
"We're just building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"Be aware of this for the next game," including the one against France.
Portugal Very Conscious
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento launches a barge against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt for him. The Portuguese football team, with its helm since 2010, has been qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is, in fact, 90 minutes apart from happiness.
One game left and one opponent left - Bosnia.
With the awareness of Friday's result, it seems clear that nothing has been won in the hell of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of predominance, but it was unable to give such a precious goal that would make it easier for it.
"It's a good result, which, however, poses a risk because we didn't put a goal outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese believe that they will advance to the audience that should create a boiling boiler there, although the match certainly appears to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but the bright-thinking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are quite convinced that we can have a two-and-a-four-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We still have a 50% chance of being Euro 2012", yet relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
Indecisive Friday game in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for the Bosians who also need to give a goal.
"It is a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we have not given a goal outside", regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has high technical quality and which has players with large individual quality", he added.
Just as in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in developing maximum pressure on the Bossen team from the outset so that they won't give them time to think."
Good idea, on condition that this time it turns out to be realistic.
