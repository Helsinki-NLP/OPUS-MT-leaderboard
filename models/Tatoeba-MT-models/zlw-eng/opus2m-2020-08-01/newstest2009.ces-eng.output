The Prague Stock Exchange dropped to a minus at the end of the trade
After the early fall, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
CEZ stock transactions reached almost half of the day-to-day trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange was set up right from the start of Tuesday’s trade to its Monday fall when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, a drop in shares is behind the drop in Wall Street.
Even in our country, there is a market reaction to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan for stabilising the financial sector there.
The Fall of Share in Asia
A dramatic fall on Tuesdays experienced shares on the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indexes in the course of the day, some losses finally deleted.
The Hang Seng Stock Index in Hong Kong recorded nearly four percent during the trading, but later deleted some losses and reduced some to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stock on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has dropped by 3.8 percent, and markets have been closed in Shanghai.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually, losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The storm in Taiwan, according to the local index, has dropped 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the US rescue is uncertain and will affect the financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, Head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Hong Kong, although part of China, sets its monetary policy separately, regardless of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rate for Hong Kong is at the same level as the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should quickly return to negotiations and propose to approve the support of the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a danger that other countries will feel the impact.
Bloody bath of American shares
The American House of Representatives rejected on Monday a plan to support the financial system, on which it was intended to spend up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion CZK).
The legislators ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, American shares experienced a bloody bath and major stock indices recorded the greatest fall in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones' index dropped by almost seven percent and fell to a similar extent for the last time in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but once it became clear that the motion in the House had not passed, the index had fallen.
Congress resigned: The U.S. Government can pump $700 billion into the bank
The senior representatives of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a wider form of a financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
The vote will be the beginning of next week.
American legislators have made a breakthrough in discussions on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the American financial system of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
But it's not won yet.
Congressmen must complete certain details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final form of the law.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Reuters told the President of the Committee on Bank and Financial Services to House Barney Frank.
At the Senate, according to sources, the plan could probably be voted on first on Wednesday.
According to economists, the notification of approval of the rescue plan should be the first significant psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
However, then there will be "difficulty" thanks to the complexity of mechanisms that help markets to achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have solved our different opinions on what the form of a market stabilization package should look like," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi for Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislators' representatives met with Henry Paulson, US Finance Minister Henry on Sunday to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy from financial companies non-sales mortgage assets that withdraw financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
There is still a need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets that are falling rapidly.
According to Canadian Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement at Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm down investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone to affect Congress’s decision on Monday’s trade.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, or whether the negotiations at the last moment can be caught up in any problem.
The legislators hope to be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still has a number of changes.
The total amount to be used for the aid of the system is to be divided into two parts.
The starting $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program does not fulfil its function, in the sequence of another $100 billion and later the final $ 350 billion.
Bush appreciated progress in negotiations
While the President may veto this decision, Congress may vote in favour of it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the redemption of poor mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay back their mortgages, has been preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the Act on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Senator Judd Gregg said.
American President Bush is satisfied with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto stated that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated the "buffering effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
The President of the Senate Bank Committee Christopher Dodd, the Head of the Negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on responsibilities for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of reliefs, the timing of the financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes to the directors of the participating companies and establish a committee to oversee the Fund.
He should be in charge of the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and will be useful for the market as well as for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts with the help of homeowners who have difficulty in paying back.
The government should negotiate new instalments for the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of repayments to debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
The proposed plan is, according to the Chief Economist Patrio Finance David Mark, a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"That's because they don't know what mechanism and at what cost problem assets will be bought out.
This will be decisive for how they divide the losses of the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not so important, according to Mark.
"A lot more important thing is that the Congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that they will sacrifice it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on approval is at this point the most important," Marek stressed.
A knife blade match: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We'll be able to decide how to choose
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can telephone.
From this it seems obvious that it is better to buy a phone.
Yet there are good reasons to buy a single player.
The choice is entirely dependent on the use and demands of the future owner.
You may find it hard to get a top-of-the-line, expensive turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
However, such music products do not appear on LP boards and there is no objective reason for this in a qualitative way.
However, if the tightness of your shelf was guilty of art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of having such a turntable at least.
It's the same with music on the road, i.e. music compromised, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and qualitative categories.
It can be unacceptable for someone to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, and like a Pink Floyd fan, it's probably hard to bite the headphones for twenty crowns from the marketplace.
Two extremes, one of which is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also decides the capacity of batteries
Some top music players can do much more than just play music, but what most cell phones can't do.
No current device is as universal as a phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephone and texting, he can play music and video, both recording, better, worse camera, and maybe even navigate.
And if we take the smartphones and the comms into consideration, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, after all, no fridge can grill, and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more function you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the greatest bits of energy.
Few cell phones can play music for more than ten 12 hours, usually it's much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more efficient.
For cheap phones, therefore, count on the fact that they won't be playing you for more than a few hours.
If you're still here and you call there, get another charger to work for sure - that's also true for more expensive machines.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the worse ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation for one charge.
Another problem arises when recording music to a cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector and, moreover, not each of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can deal with the miniature memory cards used in their phones without any reduction.
You don't need any special software for players except for the exceptions (iPod).
Just fill the machine with music through USB from your computer.
Most of the mobile phones and players will already create a music library sorted by the name of the artist, the name of the album, the genre or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some devices display only a tree structure of directories similar to a Windows explorer and some of them can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobiles can do more
When selecting a particular device, please refer especially to battery strength, memory capacity, quality and sound output type and, of course, to the comfort of control.
If music is primarily a sphere for you and if you listen to it every day for a short time in a tram, any cell phone that will play MP3 is enough.
Which can already prove almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to look at what music formats a cell phone or player can do.
MP3 can handle all and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread and apart from it the vast majority of instruments can also handle music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less present.
Better phones also allow for the purchase of online music.
Just visit the relevant site of the operator (or other provider) via the mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service could, in itself, be a strong argument for the acquisition of a music cell.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is mostly limited to the rapid-conquered radio hit.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is expected that this kind of music sale (either via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will be managed by the music industry in the future.
Most people still carry their mobiles.
Whenever you want to hear something, your phone in your pocket will feel while MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wire handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every cell phone, but only a minimum MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones is for many.
The cheapest is normally below 3,000.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of an output to common headphones.
The best and technically most equipped phones with 3.5 mm plug for common headphones cost up to 15 thousand.
The advantage of players is, among other things, an easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) - players can control really everyone.
The minimum function, the similarity of the control with the earlier ordinary taper or, for example, the turntable is obvious.
There is no conflict in the form of a mobile Internet error and a large data transfer account.
What instruments to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot on the exchange cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the card, you will fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can deal with 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 CZK.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you better reach for specialized phones - Walkmanes (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is close to the separate MP3 players.
It is further in Sony Ericsson, whose walkman phones have the same user interface as the self-sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a battery capacity (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), the MP3 players will take away from the above brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator who could make the classics cheaper.
Maybe he won't be long.
We have written on Mobil.cz many times about Czech operators being one of the most expensive in Europe.
After all, it was confirmed by the CTU, which pointed out that the SMS price was higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming fee regulation, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really wants to get into a fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and a penetration of over 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators are happy to claim that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has expressed several times that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with his own network does not seem to have much chance anymore (almostly, he would probably find no more frequency).
But there is one more option - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has just brought significant price reductions, which the classic operators had to respond to.
In the United Kingdom, however, there were similar voices to ours before Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market.
But it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we do not have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobileking in Poland.
In just six months, more than 100,000 customers managed to get this operator and become the fifth largest operator there.
The Penta financial group, which owns, among other things, U:phone, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to work effectively, it is enough for them to have much less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMSs, which is often balanced by a narrower offer of services.
In this way, Tesco Mobile, in the UK, offers at least half as cheap SMS as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move and a bet on an unsharp target group.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"Administrative men choose Mobile - an operator that they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept like that in Poland could catch up with us.
It is doubted by the press secretary of Vodafona Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, without chance, they call mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobile.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," she said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, a press spokesperson of the financial group Penta.
It has indirectly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not in favour of this idea.
Rather, they are trying to do everything they can to prevent any potential competitor from developing.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been covered by the GTS Novera Group for a long time, which would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in offering not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this option with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already made progress in the negotiations," says the press secretary of the Group Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe it's for a better time.
It seems from unofficial information that the first virtual operator should be looking forward to the end of the year.
For the time being, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, no entity has addressed us with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department Telefónika O2 said.
Other operators are also referred to the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová provides in rare agreement with the expression O2: "We have not yet recorded any viable and mutually advantageous business project on which it would be possible to further build."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network, it's hard for some virtual operator to show up by the end of the year.
At this point we would have to have a specific agreement on the table in order to be able to think in this short horizon."
Vodafone insists more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says, "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
That's what we consider the most profitable in terms of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafon in this area is to find a partner for the construction of a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
Mobile operators can easily be understood, entering another operator would mean increasing competition, leading to a drop in prices, and hence a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, make it easier for such a competitor to enter?
The fact that, when it comes to operators, they can pull a rope, even the tows around the rise of U:phone.
Probably the biggest pressure towards the CTÚ went at the time of the creation of U:phone from T-Mobile.
This is witnessed by publicly available information from the CTÚ website.
Now, however, the U:phone fits as an argument as to why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and, above all, on his services."
In view of this approach, however, mobile operators are directly concerned by the total disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not only the position of the Czech Republic, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other advanced countries - does not have the power to intervene in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Competition Protection Office (UOHS).
But he has taken his typical stand on the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible once the contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator for the hire of the necessary infrastructure has been concluded.
No such agreement has been concluded until now, since the offer of potential candidates is unlikely to be interesting enough for classical operators," said Kristián Chalupa from the UOHS External Relations Department in response to our question.
The representatives of the operators thus formulated may not be surprised.
It is more than a reasonable one from the office to represent the interests of consumers and, inter alia, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "For the abroad where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices for mobile phone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the drop in prices is not one of the interests of the ÚHS.
In fact, it is shocking to think about the whole case that the three mobile operators have a touching relationship that results from their reactions.
The question is, if this is really just a coincidence, it's offered completely on its own.
Just as the exact same price of petrol at the gas stations is certainly just a work of coincidence and a tough competition.
"The Office has not found signs of anti-competitive conduct in this case, and therefore has no reason to interfere.
None of the operators have a dominant position and therefore have adequate responsibility for their market behaviour.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to meet the telecommunications regulator," he said.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of dispute.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the OCT, according to which telecommunications is the single market from a competitive point of view.
Of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - the consent of the network operator is always needed to create a virtual operator.
And a mobile operator - quite logically - on its network of monopolys.
So in a certain segment, it has to be dominant.
However, even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning for the UNOHS that three mobile operators are doing so well.
In so doing, complaints from a number of interested parties (including those mentioned by GTS Novera) show that in dealing with all operators, they encounter very similar obstacles.
In telecoms, the responsibilities of the Czech Republic is a rather common trick to which the UOHS puts his hands off the whole issue.
We've already met him in a few similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recent amendment of the Telecommunications Act, the expansion of the competence of the CTÚ to competition in telecommunications has not been achieved, although many experts promised to improve the situation.
This must be known by the representatives of the UOHS more than well, but apparently their interests elsewhere.
It goes when no one looks
Without notice, however, the operation of some pseudovirtual operators, which there are now several in Czech mobile networks.
They are companies issuing their own pricelists of mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
It is usually a company dealing with multilevel marketing.
In this way, the mobile phone service offers, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
These companies usually only get to the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company vis-à-vis the operator acts as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then gets special price (and more) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators, similar to those of the people, are prohibited.
"If there were cases that you are talking about, there could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," she replied to our question about this issue, Martin Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that a similar activity would not be brought to responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers may be involved.
None of the operators are prevented from doing so.
In contrast to real virtual operators, they do not pose any risk to their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law of similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not kept in their name, so they cannot have it fully as normal customers of mobile operators."
But that's what the C.T.T.U. should be, at least, weird.
In addition, another question is being asked for the UNHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a similar procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has relatively strong powers to reveal similar activities, and if it does not want to, it does not need to be satisfied with the explanations of operators that they have no idea of such a thing and their business conditions prohibit it.
♪ When we're not the most expensive ♪
As has been said several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant drop in service prices.
In fact, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classic operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
The Jimi arguments used were practically identical - too small, or too saturated market, problems with service quality, etc.
In developed countries, however, regulators hit these moments, which defend not the interests of mobile operators but of their customers.
Whether by formal measures or by informal pressure they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and the packaging of others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing the whole case over as hot potatoes.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in the competences is more appropriate in these cases.
But let's not throw a flint in the vein.
If back-up information is correct and the virtual operator is really soon to appear, the Czech mobile market may start again.
If one of the operators allowed the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will hardly be possible for the UNHS to remain relentless to reject (discrimination) other interested parties.
And maybe we can stop calling the irritating than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the State Anthem where my home.
The anthem has recently recorded the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Białawek.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choral submissions and instrumental texts.
Kateřina Kněžinková and Adam Plachetka took the song.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Belohlávek considers the Czech National Song one of the most beautiful hymen.
He had previously told the Czech Radio that he deliberately selected singers with young representative voices who were prominent and popular to sing solo variations.
"From the beginning I tried both, and then also tried to make the congregation clear that they should be able to understand the text well," he said.
The Czech State Anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home first sounded in 1834 on the boards of the Stavovský Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlováček Josef Kajetán Tyl supplemented with music by František Škroup.
She got popular, and people spontaneously took her for theirs.
The first verse of songs then became a natural part of the state anthem after the origin of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" anthem
The Prague Public Health Service will be the first to ride on a chip on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers will enter the metro, tram and bus, instead of a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
He can now buy about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase 30-day and 90-day and annual coupons (this will apply from 1 January 2009) while allowing them to record their chip card in info centres and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations of the Museum, Bridgetek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andel, Roztyl, Letňany, Kobylisy, Raj Garden, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can be purchased from yesterday also via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
Service in the afternoon used over four hundred customers.
Those who start using the Internet store can definitely forget the billing windows at the metro stations, where they had to regularly stand in long queues on paper tickets.
The coupon will buy it online and record it on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places there is a ticket with trained staff to help the interested persons with online shopping and also record their purchased coupon on their card," said spokesperson Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, you will also be able to load electronic coupons at Opencard in self-service machines that are installed in several metro vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminding the ticket markers and the passengers may have noticed them in Roztyl, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltava.
"There are now five of them in town, but by the end of the year there should be 80," he added.
The coupon will check the driver's slot automatically
The vending machine service that starts tomorrow is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card into it, and the previously paid coupon will upload to it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
Thus, in suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, which mainly run into the capital by the inhabitants of the Central Bohemian villages.
"The trains included in Prague integrated transport are accompanied by card readers, using which they detect the time and frequency validity of coupons," explained the ticket check Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization, which compiles the timetables of Prague public transport.
City buses have card readers built in a cash register at the driver's office.
Therefore, it is necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to attach Opencard to the designated location on the side of the cash register.
By doing this, the driver will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drapal added.
Passengers who do not drive suburban buses and will not remember when they end the coupon may again go to self-service slots where coupons are recorded on the card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the display of the apparatus.
Sudety wanted the U.S. referendum
The Sudet Germans in 1945 asked for the integration of Šumava into the United States.
It comes from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronisation of the United States of America.
It was said that some groups of Sudetian Germans were turning to the president of the United States in 1945.
It comes from a letter that has been preserved in one private archive, and today it is stored in collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in a letter from the American President not to allow the return of the "Sumava guppy" - taken by Hitler on the basis of a Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be truly confident in the words that American troops come to the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as deliverers," says the letter, "People to whom the fate of Shumava lies."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia is allegedly giving Sudetian Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only of brutality, inadvertentness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American President to take over Šumava the protectorate for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter million inhabitants, you would grant this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and refutes minorities and nothing, you did nothing but contribute to the victory of the Allies," says the letter.
The reason why authors cannot sign is allegedly fear of the revenge of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted the thought of the Sumavian Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or live under the patronisation of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today’s postwar history, according to some memoirs, it rightly illustrates the expectations of the Sudetian Germans at that time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that they would be moved from the Republic, few of them even accepted such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and the United Kingdom would negotiate certain types of autonomy for the Sudets.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was like a Budejovický German on the Navy in Balta during the war.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holštýn, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would be useful in Czech," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia counted, according to him, that he would be removed from the Republic on the basis of the Benes decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
A campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive actions focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday could be characterized.
Minister Aleš Řebíček's office promises to dissuade the driver from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on flyers.
She should keep the drivers away from driving fast and the alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind them to chain up before they leave.
He wants to reach out to young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what happens in the spots?
Especially human stories that will attack emotions.
And that's what the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign says:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the journal.
And in the pool of blood, the word is "pay."
It's supposed to symbolize a man's ability to pay with his own life in a moment of insecurity.
The viewers will be "cooked" until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic images of accident victims can normally be seen.
He promises to reduce accidents and the number of dead on Czech roads.
The joint was prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
"The driver has a sugar and whip system.
Sugar for them is that, for example, when they go on red, they save time.
The whip is a threat of penance or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says the transport psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
That's why we need information campaigns in the press, and especially negative advertising, means psychologists.
In his opinion, the tables are already less effective, which alert the driver to danger.
"If a static table is installed to warn against danger, it is likely to blend in with the surrounding area and the drivers will not be devoted to it," said Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the provisional Israeli Government Ehud Olmert spoke for the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did this in an interview that was printed on Monday by Jedi Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will have to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," said Olmert.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (the land of Israel) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that a possible recovery would include Eastern Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in an attempt on two July attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historic places" which lies within the Old Town.
"The one who wants to keep Israel's sovereignty above the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke for the departure of Israel from the Golan highs, which, according to him, is an unthinkable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort by Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria only on the basis of leaving Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they're going to have to give up to get the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shia movement); they will have to give up the permanent support that Hamas (the Shia movement) provides, the Al-Qaida (the Terrorist Network) and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises as to whether stevardi and passengers can travel on the bus.
"If we would like to strictly and formally comply with the law, stevard's activities are contrary to the Road Traffic Law," says spokesperson Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a 22-year-old stewardess last week apparently caused a truck driver to cross the road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash, or quickly freeze, even when the stevard is delivering coffee or paper.
The role is whether the bus is equipped with standing places according to the technical card.
If the bus is not approved, passengers shall sit.
Remote buses Student Agency do not have standing places; which is confirmed by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This is what the Ministry and I have dealt with, and at first the movement of passengers did not allow.
Then they called it off and we came to the conclusion that passengers were allowed to go to the bathroom if they had their seat," he said.
The law of the stewardess doesn't know
"There is no unequivocal legal interpretation of the role of stewardess - no legislation solves that role.
However, no legislation nor prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the terms of the conductor of the vehicle; its rights and obligations do not define," says spokesperson Hanzelka.
On the contrary, the director of the road transport department Josef Pokorný considers that the law treats the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether a bus is allowed to stand in the approval.
That's it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban places where the maximum speed is fixed and limited, inter-urban with higher-speed stations and at a distance without standing with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on a plane, says an expert
Expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Horín in the movement of stevards on board the bus does not see a major problem.
"There is no danger in driving smoothly, the situation can be compared to serving on airplanes.
It's not even certain when a turbulent comes in, and a flighter can hit his head."
"But if the bus sounded violently, of course, there are laws of physics.
Just like in a city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be dealt with by the carrier's internal regulations," he says, and he also means, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel service
The student Agency offers the services of stewards as the only bus carrier.
She employs 200 of them.
Even after an accident, the Director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of stewardesses is risky, I will cancel them.
Coffee and newspaper passengers can get on board.
It would save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, he justified the absence of stewards in his cars, director Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have a stewardess, we've been up against it all along.
Sooner or later, it will end with some kind of fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Week.cz.
There's been an enormous tragedy.
A young steward from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, died in an accident of a linkage to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably went off without using the direction-line from a detached lane and blocked the way of the bus.
His driver tried to avoid the rapid maneuver, but the right front of it.
That two places reserved for the rest of the stewardess would be sold out, Jančur refuses.
"These places can't be reserved for long-range connections, they're blocked."
The company's going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the ortel of the court, but it will also expect financial compensation from the culprit.
The amendment of the law?
Inconspicuous.
The details of the movement of stevards on board the bus could bring a regulation of the law on which over a year a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport is working.
"But there was no specific conclusion.
Buses do not solve too much, rather a point system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider stevard activities to be a major threat to passenger safety," says spokesperson Hanzelka, saying that bus safety control is within the competence of the police and the safety authorities.
Düsseldorf Hope is Frankfurt
Great words in the letter from the Board of Directors of WestLB to the staff of this bank do not miss.
By linking the units of this düsseldorf money institution with the francfurt Deka-Bank, "the central institutions of the financial group will be saved for trading in capital markets," we will read in the letter that came to the public on Monday.
WestLB shall, according to the letter to this transaction, bring in a "competence principle" ensuring long-term yields.
And it is said that such a link can be a decisive impetus for further association in the banking sector.
Such texts arise when the board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose message to the Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future, is still fresh.
The link between Deka-Bank, known by customers of savings funds, and WestLB, whatever kind, has been spoken for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas, during the presentation of half-yearly results of management at the end of August, heard that in the merger of his bank house from Mainzer Landstraße with some of the banks of the Earth, such as Helaba bank or WestLB, he sees no meaning.
However, Deka-Bank’s management board, which is held by one half of the Land Bank and from the other Union of Savings, has entrusted the Board with conducting discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be capital market transactions or parts of them.
But the talks have only begun, the financials have been rescinded.
Deka-Bank, which is one of the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not spoken for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed that there might be a merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
At the end of the day, there was nothing at all from this three society.
Shortly after the merger plans had been made public, the Hessen government spoke against the participation of Helaba.
Neither the two other bank houses were connected that way.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Even so, speculation on the Deka-Bank connection with the banks of the Earth has repeatedly appeared.
However, in recent times, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, expressed negatively on the connection of his financial house with others.
However, it seems that independently, the belief that the convergence of the different banking houses of the public sector is necessary.
Now, after the elections to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, BayernLB could be the first to draw up a connection with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers is to increase, it will gradually lose potential partners for such a connection.
In the south, only the second violin would play, despite the fact that the financial crisis so far faces significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In the beginning of the year, WestLB was banned from the Union of Savings and Gyro Banks Hessen-Thüringen, which holds a five and eighty percent stake in Helaba.
The Nord LB would be the highest consideration.
However, the geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much they combine business models of individual institutions.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of what business model should be ensured by the future competitiveness of the banks, the German Union has not answered the savings banks and the gyrical banks so far.
Everything could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which no one wants in this institution, of course.
Therefore, in the letter from the Board of Directors there, they also talk about trying to "comprehensive solutions" for the whole bank house.
Whether and how it will be possible to link the individual folders to the Deka-Bank will show you time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "moreend with Italy"
It's the first time for Elena, the third or the fourth time for Luca.
But this time, Elena's gonna be like his girlfriend, and she says everything's gonna be different, she says.
Behind them, with a five-litre Kaiser barrel, there's a stronger beard and two hundred tourists on Oktoberfest shows how deep tones can release his throat.
Elena Luca's going to squeal first, and then she's going to kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From there, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses will leave this evening at 23.45 with the designation "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, only Brazilians are on one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are singing their flag, they were celebrating at night.
And so loudly, Marco Guarda says, it's nothing for the Italians.
Marcovi, who's wearing a long coat with a lining made of fur and glasses with wide silver rings, is one of those three buses.
He's been going to Oktoberfest with them for five years, only this year he has three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the stands with beer, at 10:30 departure back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the Kaiser beer toast, cooked according to the Bavarian law on beer purity, health insurance and the German speaking guide - Marco went to a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave for the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
Beer's not served, not yet.
The bus shuts up fast, the passengers sleep.
They do well, they'll need their strength.
It is located in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the highway no. 8 a.m. before Munich makes one more break and a lot of other buses with an Italian license plate.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresawies at 6:30 in the morning, there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, put on a yellow hat.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the door opens to the beer tent, run!" Marco calls in the morning air.
"Go!" Go and hold the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, you do not overcome, not all the yellow hats on the same bench, you will be placed in space!"
Máz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Do show the escorts that we're being polite.
Once you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third, "Be here at 11 p.m. tonight!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with beer tents.
On the way, one member of the group hangs the yellow hats as signs on trees, signs and even on the electoral poster of one large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
As a "moreend with the Italians," I know the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
The exact figures on the number of visitors are not available; 50 000 of those who travel through the Alps and fall into the beer tents are said to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
A number of Munich police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts national statistics in which Italians in front of the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (around 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments take the first place.
The Hofbräu tent is especially popular with the Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Believers Hypo Real Estate
Last week, the Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this policy used the word "rarely" and also involved the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared by crisis development.
'Cause the one about the last weekend came up.
The index Dax, a monitored financial house specialising in the financing of the properties of Hypo Real Estate (HRE), receives a loan of several billion from the consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence in the markets.
The person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the credit assistance in question would go up to EUR 35 billion.
Interest will only have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE).
They say money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background there are losses to the subsidiary of Depfa.
According to the newspaper report, the government’s money lending projects were extremely short-term, which is no longer possible because of the market’s mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve shrunk by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the share of equity decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 %.
Current income and net income from financial transactions decreased to zero compared to last year, income from increased claims and securities, as well as the cancellation of credit trading reserves decreased by more than 70 % to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher revenue from the compensation for the subsequent clearing costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the reimbursement of interest by tax order and the intermediation of trade for the group companies was a 16 % decrease on the income side still moderate.
After his privatisation in 1990, an earlier state financier burned himself on mortgages for traders, which were then excluded from the service portfolio and led by Aareal Bank.
Since there was too little in classical state funding, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private investors and state projects (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and was internationally differentiated.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate now has to write down something, and these write-downs will have a "principal material effect" to calculate the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have been undefinitely heard.
The fact is, there won't be a dividend.
Two thirds have been reduced for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been an important financier of state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of Depfa.
More than other institutions, it depends on re-financing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
Following the downfall of the U.S. investment bank, Lehman Brothers practically dried up the source of interbank loans two weeks ago because the banks safeguard liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for some Depfa credit portfolio - around 50 billion Euros per year.
According to the report by Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of the group are covered by this loan for a short time and the company is protected "from the effects of international money markets to a large extent of inability at present".
Other sources have been heard that these funds provide for refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, the President of the Board of Directors of HRE Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets in a short time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured on the market.
That's what shareholders and bank creditors hope for.
But with regard to the dynamics and indisputability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan would not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank was standing before insolvency on Sunday afternoon, it seems that the bank could not, although preliminary, calm down the passion.
The share rate fell by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, the bond courses were good.
While priority debts have not practically moved, they lose secondary bond courses more significantly.
This applies mainly to the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and logically with the maturity after 2009.
Obligation Hypo-Real-Estate originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability is needed after a marked exacerbation of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depfa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issued banks, governments and less affected trading banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their maturity period.
But there may also be something that almost no one dares at present - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalisation, it has now become a mere legitimate hope.
This will probably prepare for long-term creditors a series of nights of study when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the limit line at least to generate a conversion of losses from previous accounting years to exchange-rate yields of subsequent years for the purpose of future payment of capital-income tax.
Sylvana and the secret box bento
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltropová is to introduce herself at Tachibana High School on the first day, the girls will snoop: the German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from mang.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been chased out of my way to school.
I live on the border of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train at Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the start of teaching in Tachibana is not given as strict as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after 8 o'clock and 20 minutes before 9 o'clock starts sitting with the teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But before school started, I should've introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on my old host mom's dress, my shirt, my blue underpants, and my black leather shoes.
So I stood up in front of the bench and tried to say everything right: 'Sajonara Wo Še Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and it's my birthday next week.
At that point, I was so glad that I started learning my language two years ago.
All 31 girls in class were fucking, gibberish and whipping, and I still heard the word "kawaii".
I already knew that from my mang.
They belong to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I got into my seat quickly.
The girl, next to me, smiled pretty wide, thought it was an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong came in, they literally hit me.
They spoke through each other, and they giggling and asked me about the possible and impossible -- and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then they all unpacked their bentas for a break.
My host mom also made me a lunchbox like that, and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some fish in a tofu dough.
I don't know what I'm eating in Japan at all.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
The thing is, everything's really good.
Well, except for the salted plums, br!
Benta in Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives the boy a personally-prepared bento, which is particularly artistically modified in this case, and hopes to know the boy in a snack about the break.
That's what I read about in my comic book.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
'Cause he's just fascinating me.
After all, I like to read the mango for years.
And to understand these comic books and their culture better, I started learning Japanese once.
So I knew I'd have to come here someday.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the latest technology and trends, on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
And rats have feelings
When a rat or cockroach flees from danger, does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify that they feel the same way when they act like us?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions from known scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in his series presents a selected answer to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it, if we can't prove that consciousness has other people.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we start to devote ourselves to another kind and open up the questions of perception or general awareness, we enter the indecent terrain because the hardware does not match.
If a rat gets into danger, he will do the same thing as many other animals: pretend to be dead, run or attack.
People act similarly, from which some scientists consider comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe in that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal life.
It is also because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include a lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its contribution to short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems that other creatures are completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal cortex, among them knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that you are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature could hide the human’s language: because so much of his perception is associated with the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if consciousness did not care about the language, the language would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, however designed, probably differs from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to figure out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as an internal and subjective something, it cannot even be measured because of a special hardware, it analyses on the basis of our own experience, it puts us in search of its own problems.
Most of my origins refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what is happening in short-term memory studies in primates, especially on an example of visualization.
But this approach, devoted to Christof Koch and Francis Crick, concentrates more on neuronal colates of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: they can both be identical, but they may also not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the nefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I'm the reason why the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain, conscious of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of a defence system located in the brain (or its consequences such as physical reactions) uses the operating memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely linked to those cortex areas that are characterized by primates, and especially humans.
In connection with language nature, there is a fine degradement of perception, because through words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states in order to assign them to others.
On the other hand, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brain strain areas dedicated to physical feelings, such as Jaak Pankseep, which is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could be able to participate in feelings perceived by several animal families.
I can't, in theory, resist it, but I find it inconclusive.
Panksheep argues that what appears to us in rats and people seems like fear is likely to feel both organisms the same way: How can it be verified, says Panksheep, whether rats and people feel the same way when they act in a similar way?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the harmony of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain tribes, but cockroaches and brains.
But is he responsible for the feelings of the brain tribe?
And even if it were possible for a man to prove it, how would we want to do it in the rat?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are likely to be fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and on the tongue), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can look forward to progress on a neutral level if we measure the same with rats and humans.
As with rats, I don't examine the language and consciousness, I don't examine the feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It can be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throwing myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platini: Time limit for Poland and Ukraine
Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be headed directly by the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize ME together with Poland," said Vasjunyk.
"It's not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the early fulfilment of the time plan for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports both hosts glide.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will decrease from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said the President of the Ukrainian Union, Grigorij Surkis.
"EUFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
Following numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee, the Polish PZPN was called off and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious danger that PZPN will not be able to follow the rules," said Drzewiecki Polish press agency PAP.
"The President of UEFA Michel Platini, by letter, has assured us that the preparations for ME 2012 will not suffer this step."
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to forced retreat only in the last season due to manipulation, and in the end he had to move the start of the league quickly.
Disturbing Dennis Quaid Returns Strike
She wanted to make a commercial for a new movie, talk about private stuff, and now she's having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage disruptor.
He's mad and he's coming back.
The delayed war of roses with the former marriage couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce together, these two Hollywood actors have had an inconvenient dispute - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan first expressed herself in an interview for the American magazine InStyle last week for reasons of the failure of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she learned about the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The highlight for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - it tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaida's response to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: "She's crazy," said New York Daily News's four-year-old actor, "Meg repeatedly chews on the history of our relationship and adjusts it."
In addition, it is "politically appropriate" that the 16-year-old son of Jack, once again, "is publicly a reminder of the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child."
While Ryan's been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of the twins.
He ends up thinking about bending like this: "My life is going on anyway.
I consider myself happy to have an amazing family that is doing well."
Flights and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe was cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one current study, flights were even cheaper up to 50 percent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have decreased again - this is the result of a study of the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, after rising prices in the first quarter, found their significant decrease in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already been cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities followed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most significant was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
As a cause of this trend, the American Express considers the dollar's weak exchange rate, which caused the "declining taste of American tourists to travel".
The lower prices of hotels were also more affected by financial centres than industrial centres, such as Hannover, Kolín nad Rýn or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices increased by 26.3 percent, and even recorded a European record.
Flight prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter of the year:
Because of the healing of kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay 7.1 percent on average more than in 2007, even 29.2 percent more on fuel-intensive long-term flights.
From April to June the flight prices in the Economa class decreased by 12,5 percent on average compared to the previous quartal, but in the Business and First-Class classes, changes in knowledge were less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11,9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23,6 percent.
In German national years, according to quoted studies, prices fell by even half.
One reason for this price decline is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
A sign of a tense situation is the disruption of non-profitable airlines as well as the high number of airlines that launched the competition in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the forefront of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is no longer failing to build up a working 11.
He wrote Kristoffer Klein - to increase the unsuccessful landing for the representative of Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach has been involved in the game until late and failed to get the ball on the stick.
His report was precisely formulated and sounds persuasively out of his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
It wasn't much happening in the catacombs, the half-life break ended, and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physical therapist of HSV for almost three decades and he enjoys more respect than a few moments.
So his request was also answered in a responsible place.
Coach Cornelius Jol's assistant drew a note and lifted his thumb to the mark of conformity.
Cornelius is the brother of head coach Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order was probably the same: I'm with the other goal!
No, no, no, no.
"It wasn't looking at everything here today," said Marcell Jansen later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted it more freely".
1:0 (1:0) The Hamburgians owe the head of Mladena Petrić (11.) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladadasians could not harm the weak Hamburgians.
"It was a dirty victory," summed up by Martin Jol.
The Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence this Monday.
So on Saturday afternoon the viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the live updated videoboard in which their team was presented as a premium.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the continuous table result symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern won Jansen - is still not able to flash yet.
"We need more feeling and more dribling," Jol said.
After defeat in the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of sinking the rescue package caused a drop in the Dow Jones index by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow gained some weight.
Around 20.30 he showed this world's most important stock exchange barometer a 5% drop on 10 579 units.
Nasdaq Technology Exchange was with more than seven percent minus 1548 points.
The worst part was in Dowow at this point American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
The Goldman Sachs bank's shares have lost nearly ten percent.
A few days ago, the company had a share of the big investor Warren Buffett.
In the framework of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called damaged mortgage papers.
However, the total amount should not be paid at the same time but in several stages.
In return, the State is to receive stock lists of financial companies that could be paid back in favourable exchange rate developments, thus reducing the burden on the state budget.
Action courses in Europe fall steeply
There is no doubt about helping banks in Europe and the US.
The share rate of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly down and is downloading the index Dax with it.
Despite the planned rescue of the financial market, the U.S. index of Dow Jones is losing its state.
The spectral exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the index of German shares (Dax) down to the minus.
Despite the rescue of the federal government and private banks, the shares of the aforementioned Munich real estate financier have lost up to three quarters of their value, Commerzbank has lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important limit of 6000 points and with a minus 3.7 percent recorded 5 839 points.
The stock markets have gone to their knees all over the world.
In New York City, the Wall Street business day started with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government rescue package worth $700 billion would not need to be sufficient to resurrect the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent during the first hour of trading and is thus at 10 809.25 points.
The American House of Representatives is to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could express itself on 1 October.
The rest of Europe's stock markets have also gone one way: in London, the FTSE index was first reduced by 3.2 percent, CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index Nikkei dropped by 1.26 percent to 11,743,61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18 286.90 points.
In India, the leading index of Sensex 506,43 points, i.e. 3,9 percent, and trade ended at 12 595,75.
In MDAx, they lost their share of Arcandor's share after the announcement.
Sal Oppenheim's private bank signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourist group announced that the shares in Thomas Cook did not sell.
Dark matter affects the years of space probes
For years, scientists have not known the advice of one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not have been entirely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the Ulysses space probe flew through space.
The blame of the fuel lines, which will soon freeze, now threatens to die in winter.
Among scientists for years one mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion - the anomaly of the gravitational practice.
The gravitational formula is the aerial maneuver of space probes, where they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of some cosmic body, such as the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what scientists have said for years in this case is astounding: flying bodies do not behave 100% as a person would expect according to the good old gravitational law.
On the contrary, irregular speed occurs.
The probes will unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
So far, physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptized by a gravitational anomalies.
Several experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes mass attraction by curvature, may not have been quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was right, and he is trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational practice using the so-called dark matter whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The one responsible for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has been known by space explorers for about ten years.
It is obviously a gravitational force whose effect on other space bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means it does not broadcast or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, just not visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt kidnapping tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the information of the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt, tourists are again at large.
The kidnappers in Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were killed in a shootout before the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
I hear the ransom negotiations are coming.
The Germans repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
Europe's tourists are apparently free to go to the Sahara.
The Egyptian State Television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija, and the Italian media reported this.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release of the Italian TV station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were released.
We're looking into their medical condition right now," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian State Television report, five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert seem to be on their way to Cairo.
The background of the shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to the Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed with the ransom," said the quoted worker.
He said "it was just about taking over the hostages," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and captured two of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
El Masri El Jom, referring to one of the German mediators, said that the release of the hostages is being delayed because the kidnappers are worried about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release women's hostages after paying the ransom.
Men should have been held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
My stepfather's abuse "has led to suicide"
Multiple-year abuse by her stepfathers led a woman to kill herself to sound in court.
After he confessed to eight sexual harassment cases, he was seventy-seven years old Michael Treris of Stithians, Cornwall, sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that Stephanie Randle's stepdaughter was regularly bound when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," he wrote Treris in confession.
In the court, it was also said that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother was working at the pub.
Treris and his wife got divorced in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was said before the court that Miss Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, pursued the appearance of abuse, which was committed twice a week.
The plaintiff Ramsey Quaife in court stated that in 2006, friends of Miss Randle, who also devoted a lot to surfing and cycling, was "emotionally dead" and that "she gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She thinks she suffocated herself with a plastic bag.
Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I tied her up and tied her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn't done so, the matter probably wouldn't have gotten to court at all."
"I would especially like to highlight the consequences that Stephani's parents said your crime on their daughter over the years," he added.
"She'd probably be a promising, successful, happy young woman otherwise."
The officer who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top secret documents on the Waterloo train when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defense.
The documents were put in the hands of the BBC before the police were handed over.
It's the least serious offense against that law, and nothing suggests criminal intent.
The BBC Secretary for Defence Affairs Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was handled internally between the Ministry and the Government Office," he said.
An employee who may not be appointed is charged under section 8.1 of the law in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police be charged on the basis of a very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained the secret analysis of Al Qaeda and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown place.
Co-contribution accounts face the debt of B&B
After saving Bradford & Bingley, British cooperatives may have to deal with more than 80 million pounds in debt.
The government provided £2.6 million to protect deposits in Bradford & Bingley.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative assumptions.
The CEO of the Association of Cooperatives (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "consolidating" that the assumptions and their members must pay.
Fourteen-billion dollar debt will eventually be repaid by saving Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest that comes in the meantime will be paid every year by all 700 financial companies that take client deposits.
The Fund’s MSP for the BBC confirmed that all 59 co-operative assumptions were included in this issue.
It is humiliating that these institutions, who have behaved prudently... now have to pay back some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from so prudent
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that every company has to pay proportionally to the deposits it held and that the assumptions are supposed to pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that debt interest will increase to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the assumptions will have to find 81 million pounds to pay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, the CEO of the cooperative trade union, said the BBC is convinced that this is not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that have acted prudently during the booming of the housing market must now pay back some of the accounts of those institutions that have far from being considered."
According to BSA, no backup since 1945, when it appeared, has not fallen.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this matter in the next few weeks to see what possibilities are to protect cooperative sites and their members from accounts that could be essential," added Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of this September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since cooperative assumptions are non-shared shareholders, their members will eventually be paid by means of higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk will go five pennies per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey's dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by fivepence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penth installment in February, and it comes after the research carried out by the consulting company.
Retailers are supposed to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect on the way to the customer prices.
The wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002 before February.
Penalties for Bangladeshi expremier rejected
The Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Shajch Hasina Vadjid's request to be released for bail, which means that if she returns to her country, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the charge that extortion received over $50 million from a certain entrepreneur such (729 700) when she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of the few accusations of corruption against her.
Chálida Zijaová, a long-standing political rival of Shaich Hasiny, was previously released on bail this month.
Shajch Hasin is to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League, asked that the local army held by the government first give her complete freedom.
The writers say that while she was released on an honorary word to undergo a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear under the conditions of her release that she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she's now referring to the Supreme Court against the orders of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Shajch Hasina's request for bail with the fact that she does not need bail when she is already undergoing an investigation abroad," said Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the orders of the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail so she could return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Shajch Hasina was to return home after October 17.
She was arrested last year after the army held by the provisional government took over power, but was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for a medical procedure.
Shajch Hasin and Chálida Zijáová both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of O.R. vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in recent polio vaccination due to the Taliban’s violence.
The United Nations was vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she says that for security reasons, she couldn't reach the children in the south in the parts of Helmandu and Kandahar.
Despite Taliban promises, the UN spokesperson stated that there would be no attacking or hindering thousands of vaccine workers at work.
BSkyB lost a lawsuit about ITV
BSkyB lost a judicial dispute over the review of the Commission’s decision on competition which had BSkyB reduce its share in the competing broadcasting company ITV.
BSkyB’s Board of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% below 7.5%.
The Commission previously stated that BSkyB’s share of BSkyB was in a fight against competition and had a disproportionate impact on ITV.
BSkyB bought a share in the store in 2006, which, as a result, prevented NTL, now renamed Virginia Media, ITV to buy.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that BSkyB’s acquisition of BSkyB’s shares in ITV had given rise to doubts about ITV’s independence and called on the Commission to compete.
The head of the Virginia Sir Richard Branson consortium, the consumer organization and regulators of Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued by forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a solution disproportionate - especially because BSkyB had previously said that she was willing to give up her voting rights.
New investigation into the affairs of American lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
Tah came in a situation where the report on an aphery prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report was criticized by officials of the White House, legislator and former Minister of Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was encouraged by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Danney will now be investigating whether investigators lied during the investigation to investigators in order to prevent justice.
In his report, General Glenn Fine stated: "A serious statement, including a potential criminal act, has not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the US Justice Department eliminated nine U.S. attorneys in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry stated that lawyers were released because of weak performances.
However, later it turned out that the release of lawyers was no worse assessed than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers have been involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican Members and Senators, others have refused to investigate the accusations of deceptive voters against the Democrats.
American lawyers are investigating and prosecuting courts for the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
At that time, the head of the Justice Department, Minister Alberto Gonzales, was released under fire and finally resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice has also resigned.
The report of the Inspector General expressed very critical criticism about the role of Gonzales in the aphery, saying that he held "main responsibility" for release, that he "abdicated" from his position and did not "remarkably engage".
Other officials, including former high-level Bush advisor Karl Rove, were criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's honor will be appreciated
Rock star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
A singer who comes to London for his special gold prize at the next weekend in London said that he was "respected" by his appreciation.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the composition of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Nomination for this year is led by the group Coldplay, which has reached a narrower choice in four categories.
Paul Rees, the main editor of the Q Magazine, said, "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and the Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started the instrumental part, which lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and it reached maximum 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Hell album was held in the ranking for about nine years and sold over forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, a real name named Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, was operated in 2003 due to irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out he had cyst on his vocal cords.
Occupied streets, often forgotten and perhaps early for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other land-based communications, some famous, other only useful.
But there are a lot of veterans and long-term locals who have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This little alley is in East Village, leading north of First Street without getting to Second Street between Bowery and Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic move.
There are no street names signs.
She's practically invisible in a normal atlas.
Yet, there is an aisle of admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants the Extra Place to be newly exterminated and to create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques to open up in new buildings.
Other admirers are long-standing neighbors who say that they were cut down the alley enchanted simply because it was one of the last remnants of the time before the block was engulfed.
However, the City Office for Protection and Development, which has the street in its power, is not least interested in holding it.
At the meeting of the municipal community land committee, representatives of the city office and Avalon Bay outlined a plan that the street developer should buy.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, Regional Manager of the General Community 3, the Committee prefers such a variant as the streets remain in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan that should be given next month.
"The city already owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its ownership," she said.
"Repair and administration proposals may be made, which may be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to start a small street to freshen up and plant seats, several of which would be using a cafe whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay spokesperson, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this derelict alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale proposed the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Bureau of Maintenance, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and he noted that the task of his office was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a single trace in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's big farm was divided into several of his children and on that narrow stripe of the country no one was entitled.
The extra Place led the back door of CBGB, a punk-rock monument that closed in 2006, and the alley is perhaps the most famous as the background photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took a photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the processing of the East Village, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, though penitentiary, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - almost unchanged piece of the city, which should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's disappearing New York (with the subtitle "The Book of lamentations: bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), published part of the story of Extra Place from the section Let's talk about the city which appeared in The New Yorker's newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even in the day and bounded by rusty iron doors of warehouses and broken windows, where a week's old newspaper runs through in the streams."
Except for a few exceptions, the alley of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat ran through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where today's store with expensive clothes stands.
On the walls there was graffiti and next to the fresh dose of discarded newspapers there was an empty beer bottle.
A couple of passers said they rarely think of Extra Place, but they suggested that arousal might be useful to him.
On the other hand, Fields said that they thought that some people underestimate the impressiveness of the alley in its present condition.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingual quality: immersion to English
In this edition of the section Focused on Education Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic from California and the Director of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Horse than you think: why middle class needs to choose schools".
Effectively addressing Hispanic voters is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama's educational agenda just proves it.
Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-American and Hispanic students have a significantly lower probability that they are enough than white pupils," which is true.
To fight such performance differences, Obama advocates the educational agenda especially, among other things, "transient bilingual education" for those who are learning English.
The question of Barack Obama remains, however, whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Consider, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom only recently arrived, are only learning English.
Even though, in the state tests on mathematics in 2008, 100 percent of fourth-class pupils got to the highest level.
Almost as amazing ninety-three percent of fourth-class pupils got to the highest level in the state tests in English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a method other than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street highlights control and training, continuous assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Further, and this Obama should notice, is according to Linda Mikels, Director Sixth Street, pedagogy approach school for those who only English only learn, "full immersion".
Immersion in English highlights the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against bilingual education, said to me: "We had a huge success with one completely new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would go into class and you wouldn't know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a role model, how should other schools with large shares of Hispanic and English learners?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer to this question self-evident, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a longtime supporter of dual-lingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education reveal Obama's response.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to delete the performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work rather than mock them and try them.
Oil is falling rapidly due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell rapidly on Monday because of fears that even the US plan to save financial markets would not have to resurrect the economy.
The prices of scheduled oil stores fell in the morning trade on the New York commodity exchange by up to 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street as well as by a couple of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 a barrel in July earlier this month prices almost $90 a barrel, and then again they jumped on the wave of enormous uncertainty of financial markets.
The injury re-embarked investors on Monday, even after the Congress Presidency announced that they had reached an agreement on the largest rescue plan in history this weekend.
This report has been overshadowed by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive decomposition, the government announced that the Citigroup group would buy the Wachovia Corporation banking section.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg government partly nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the turbulent weekend negotiations that led to the rescue plan of the economy "are shown to be unable to revive the mood on the market".
As the economic situation worsens, commodity demand, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for global stock markets, interest rates and exchange rates have strongly been identified," the analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in their report to investors.
"We believe the commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our greatest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread throughout the world and especially to China."
The bank’s analysts have limited their expectations for next year, as oil consumption has decreased due to the slower growth of the economy and reduced its projections for the price of petrol for 2009 by about 20%.
Wild ride in the second quarter overcame the team's record
After spending the last eight seasons in Jets' uniform more than anyone else, the defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
Then, on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which Jets turned the pointless game into a crazy ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizona Cardinals settled down their troubled game with dark clouds over them.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Coles to a twelve-yard touchdown sprint, thus perfectly predicting the afternoon in which their gradually developing cooperation shifted a mile forward.
Favre sent Coles out in this quarter for two other touchdowns, including the one in which he fell Cornerback, and the next 10 seconds before half the match.
"It was nothing unusual," said Favre about all his passes to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We communicated perfectly, no matter what people thought."
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense attacked the quarterback of Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith took another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to get his ass kicked.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, may have been the best at all.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, he kicked Jay Feelly's 20-yard goal out of the field, resulting in a 34-0 lead.
That's the most Jets have ever gained in a quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was asked to describe this madness, said, "A second quarter or a third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third one.
A lot of points fell in a short period of time."
Restful Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best remote runner ever, when on Sunday in Berlin the marathon overcame its own world record and became the first man to run 26.2 miles long race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasantly flat line in time 2:03:59 he overcame his previous time by 27 seconds 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - has overcome the world record or is at least a champion of the world at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month Gebreselassia avoided the Olympic marathon in Beijing because he was afraid - from a retrospect perhaps too scared - that polluted air will upset his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees in the finish - won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a flashy average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As track runners such as Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on longer lines, the marathon record dropped by more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, he told Gebreselassie to the journalists that he had been convulsing in a calf two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Apparently, it's more of a break than it's delayed.
"I'm so happy," said Gebreselassie to reporters.
" Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I was in some kind of doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - because he was overly planning his races, generally avoiding the world's marathon peaks, relying on guides, as if it were a race on the track, and building world records over the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassi's enormous running quality.
Maintained at the pace of four Kenyas, Gebreselassie reached half in time 1:02:04.
After the conductors had fallen, Gebreselassi was constantly chased by two elite Dutch runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal of Gebreselassia last worked and fled Kwambai, who then ran second in time 2:05:36 and improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi ended the third time at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitěnková, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, concluded the excellent year with the seventh fastest time of history.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paula Radcliff from Great Britain.
Sixty-year-old Mikitěnková won surprisingly last spring at the London marathon at 2:24:14.
Beijing's games left out for something that was described as back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon that ever ran, improved its personal maximum by almost five minutes.
The race ran cleverly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenya’s runners escape and then reached them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Ascale Tafa Magrasa from Ethiopia arrived second after 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop from Kenya ended the third time at 2:25:01.
Prudence and obstacles to the lives of black people in a separate city
Hided among the widest entertainment parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles from all the shiny, noisy, and giant, lies a quiet city in which the pride and ardentness of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city, which was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, three hundred brown leathers, three hundred good swimmers, enough quay, two schools and no prisons."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatingville festival of Zora! to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city that she described remains a party, although she made it a stop for tourists by including him in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many of the local residents remain cautious about the views of strangers.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the oldest parish in town.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of black growth and a community of almost 2400 people, where the poverty rate is doubled compared to the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also a shadowed example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - which was created by American slavery.
It is not surprising that local residents are both proud and protective.
And worry about Eatonville's idea really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her hearty books full of lamentation as "Mules and Men (Muly and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florid tourist guide changed the city to road 17, which leads through the often missed center of Florida, to stage of the Black History and human drama.
With the rascal of a great drum in life and literature, Hurston introduced the readers into the store of the first eatonville mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to a more separate place.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "it's a white brownly decorated national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, even though he can't read or write about."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that matches the hourly hotel."
So in just a few hundred words Hurston Eatonville connected with self-government, but also illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
This obviously wasn't a typical Fodor's publisher.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls' choirs, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she said.
Hurston is still mentioned as a chipper eccentric who often came back after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that, most of the time, when she arrived in the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud of decent clothing today.
Most of the population was fascinated, said Franklin, but many were snooping.
"People always liked to see Zora," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabela, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were eliminated from the press.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, the present of Langston Hughes and the only black girl at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived earlier.
There were no major memorial celebrations or great public readings in Eatonville.
"I think that neither its meaning for the world nor its legacy was understood at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's CV, "Wraped in Rainbows" published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
The representatives of Orange County wanted to stretch the five-way highway through the city instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a local two-way route.
It's already crossed the interstate highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a complicated historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, he brought the struggle for mixing races of hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys came and threw oranges and stuff at people who sat on the side," Franklin said.
"We actually had a lady here who killed it.
They threw a melon out of the car."
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel of 1955, Hurston questioned the requirement of the Supreme Court for forced integration and his decision in the Brown case against the Education Chamber stated that it "is insulting to my race rather than celebrating."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the youth here.
"Black children were used to hugging - I remember - you embraced your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher at night," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and CEO of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
That took until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Nathiri said.
Nevertheless, civil rights helped create space for many more Zory Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudices with reckless self-esteem and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I won't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker appealed to the unmarked grave of Hurston and began to fight for the recovery of her reputation.
Five years later, he came to the police in the bookstores, praised by Hurston's résumé by Robert E. Hemenway, who reclassified her in the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville once again found the ramp lights.
The former Hurston neighbors now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to the party.
After a few years, the State withdrew from the motorway proposal.
"The five streams of the highway have risen, you'd say it set off directly, with real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over a highway project helped change the city's image.
An out-of-town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started attending the church in 1993, began to appear in more numbers, and the residents began re-evaluating the past.
Eatonville joined the national historical register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named after Hurston) was opened in 2006 to re-implanted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florid anomalies: only six miles from the center of Orlando can sometimes act as a fallen alley in the summer rain as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today is 90 percent black.)
With strangers who come looking for a story and the meaning of Eatonville, it is still often treated cautiously.
Authorisation for most interviews is necessary to have in advance and certain things - like wall paintings in the oldest eatonville church, which painted white men and which depict blacks in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a courageous, confident teacher who likes to be red all the time, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even so, as the Hurston Festival has increased, domestic pride has also increased.
Especially young people want to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not as proud and as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnics.
From Franklin's nephew's 18-year-old Edwin Harvey's voice, there's a genuine love for the village when she's planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in a local government or police department that she'd use some help.
And even younger ones, such as 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonova, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they pass through here, think, "Well, this town is nothing against the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment into history, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak in financial gas.
Nothing's changed around here at first sight.
If the tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newsstands and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in a glassed bee hive of offices over their heads each day, bankers and managers of investment funds who monopolize New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still razing metal carts along the pavement and transferring muffin bakers to breakfast meeting.
Hispanics are still moving between the turrets and wearing, like human mules, 50 ironed shirts hanging from the vahadels on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at street food stands, and it is still impossible to get a yellow cab on a daily day between 4 and 7 in the afternoon.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all until I decided to start a savings account on Thursday afternoon with all the pessimism talk.
Even though I was timing this task to cover up with a late afternoon sitter at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were about 20 people waiting there in the front.
Not in front of the cash registers to pick up or store cash, but before the counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask about their way to the Macy's mixed goods store and new customers start their accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason as me.
But they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They collected money from so-called thrifts (a bit similar to building savings), money associations and those savings companies whose branches operate only in one state and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have disappeared quietly.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets for $327 billion, auditions, and when the New Yorkers returned home on Friday night, she tried another bank, Wachvia, with assets for $440 billion, to hunt down a rescue buyer.
The office workers and the shops who stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse moved their cash to the bank, which is perceived as a safe haven, and which makes most of the rescue on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned gas in the last week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket was talking on the phone and speaking to Lehman Borthers, the failed bank, and her skinny executive officer Dick Fuld with such familiality as if she was snooping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed 50-year-old house of my apartment building, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I've got my savings in money market funds now.
I moved it, I won't take any chances."
Muslim graves desecrated by the Austrian right-wing fracture
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-wing side of the Free and Filip Dewing from the Belgian right-hand side of Vlaams Belang participates in the demonstration, which presented in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 the "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that show the mosques crossed by a red line.
Police blame right-wing extremists for desecrating the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extreme right-wing parties have made huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linza were sometimes seriously destroyed between Friday night and this morning, and the police are convinced it was an organized event.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols on some graves, such as the star of David, but the detectives believe that this may have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred to Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident has been linked to the choices in any way.
The spokesperson of the Islamic community here said that they are "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration that is coming at the end of the Muslim post month Raman.
In the meantime, Austria enters the round for the search for its own soul after the collapse of traffic in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both extreme right-wing parties, which gained more than 30 percent of the votes, the Free Party and the Union for the future of Austria, led a vehemently anti-immigrant campaign and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the Free Party, who won over 18 percent of the votes, protested against scarfs and burkas in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to meals that are perceived as a relationship with Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke about "European Brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties seek to ban the construction of mosques and miners and argue that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Explorations and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have put extreme right-wings into the position of the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that this change was mainly caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't go on a trip abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who was convicted of sexual abuse of children, was banned from going to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitz after informing the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police were agreed to this travel ban last Thursday after they handed over evidence of Glitter's past convictions for child sexual abuse to officials.
Glitter, his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
The spokesperson for the court said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford's least criminal court, the Kent police requested a regulation to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not personally participate."
64-year-old Glitter has informed the authorities that he wishes to travel abroad, as it records it to him in the registries of sexual attackers.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also forward the planned date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If he had neglected to inform the authorities, he could have been sentenced to five years.
Kent's police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible routes to the county.
The Kent police spokesperson said: "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to track someone who stays in Britain, because we have extensive systems that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent police, and we are working carefully to monitor the behaviour of recorded sexual attackers to minimise any risk to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to fly to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he arrived at the Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there, while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridg's lowest criminal court in West London, and at the same time successfully requested an order to register as a sexual assailant.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for possession of child pornography.
The source from the Home Office said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, is calm and glad that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture a true character, I take pictures of a master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of great flamenca masters, separated from the focus on interpretation - only I achieve the relaxed expression of a man or woman.
An artist on one side.
On the other hand, man.
Inseparable, if we ignore privacy, in those moments far away from the audience - then one can see a confidential gesture, a depth of summer captured view or a passionate gesture of hands that are carefree, because they are not going to appear on stage.
The German Günther Bauer turns into a "Flamenco-people" theatre performance with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less famous face of the masters.
With this purpose, the photographer draws up a unique iconography of flamenca from different environments.
The exhibition that takes place within the programme of the Moon of flamenca (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the ever growing international importance of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but if you look at the photos, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the stage.
These people portraited on "the street" are able to carry passion, sadness, joy... and completely impress the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was curious to create a relaxed atmosphere that will allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco's greats.
Charmed by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer started a long journey in 1997 by portraiting flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on the board camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the selection of the camera and the material, resemble classical photographs.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classic basis of the image and lends it the current spirit, which is an idea, according to Bauer himself, reflected by flamenco as well: "Music with very traditional roots, which does not cease to be surprising and developing."
What brings out the audiences is not the effect of dancing itself, singing or playing, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment we meet the most important, with the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is a constant work presented during these days in the El Fotómata Gallery.
This selection of nearly seventy photographered artists consists of famous flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Moreente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of anthology flamenca and it will soon reach a book edition that will contain displayed portraits.
The passion for portraiting led Bauer to the idea of repeating his idea of "Portraits of Sports Veteran" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept of "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "photo people, recognize them and have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - that is my passion.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or encounters people, personalities he doesn't know at times, or only give him a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the current flamenca called "Flamenco-people" is displayed in the Gallery El Fotómata in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, and it is possible to visit it until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he writes is "truly"
It takes place in an environment he doesn't know yet, and he talks about the events of the unknown, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for 20 years and traveled in Amazonia.
The eternal favorite Nobel Prize for literature was admitted yesterday at Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is currently employing him is "student" and that "it suggests everything that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't have done it, but I will, and I believe I will," concluded his contribution to the exchange festival of ideas, thoughts and words, which he saw in the city of the aqueduct of about hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in four days.
The author of the novel "The City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and fulfilled the expectations.
Vargas Llos, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our musical friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre in the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had a dedicated audience, whose hour of time ran like water - a Peruvian with amazing accuracy and a noteful amount of humor remembered in it from the original "unbelievable adventure" of "the delight of a passionate reader" and "the power to live more than what I've lived" gave birth to a literary mission; how the lack of inspiration sums up by writing "disciplinarily", a simple text, corrects and rewrites; or how they influenced his writing Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "recognition images" are the bases of his stories.
Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out if and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a mere fun, elusive experience" - stressed Vargas Llosa with the fact that he thinks "people are acting" and "he forces them to turn away from the line", and called on writers to "do not be subject to frivolity" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Because of the climateology, the festival in Pozoblanc loses its place - there are no copies
The performance with the copies, which closed the ceremony in Pozoblanc, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcements were confirmed to the effect that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
That's why the company together with Fermin Bohórquez, Pable Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernandez decided to cancel the bullfight.
In the long term, adverse weather conditions plague this festival, which two of the three celebrations could not have been held.
On Saturday, he prevented the rain from running other planned bullfights.
During them the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista was to build bulls in the arena on Castilblanc.
But that was only Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and a reward for a dynamic and aesthetically quality performance was carried out on his shoulders.
On the same day in the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante turned two wounds through the spears for greetings and one ear that brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than the Toreador art.
El Juli, who went through the bull's arena Los Llanos, was unpainted.
In the second round of hard work without breath, most of the audience has earned harsh criticism.
They missed a checkup in Álav in a van with two thousand kilograms hashish
In ten minutes, five.
Road control of Ertzaintza in the city district of Armiñón (Alava).
The officers stop two people driving in the van and they drive.
Cost, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to the report from the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government, members were persecuted and arrested by one of the people in the van, a man 38 years old who was identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out roadside checks at N-1 in places where they pass the border of the city district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, speeded up and ran.
The car owners immediately began to prosecute when the vehicle stopped near the road a few kilometres away, at which point both passengers jumped and fled to the forestland.
In the end, Ertzaintza members caught up with one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects carried as it appeared during the inspection of the Iveco Daily supply.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages, which were subsequently transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "swamped" and did not agree with the particulars given in the delivery documents, so the detained person was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues his search for the second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, managed to escape to finally determine the origin of the confiscated drug.
Arrested A.A.J., 28 years old, he was transferred to the police department to settle appropriate formalities before he later proceeded to further investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, a favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of a parking lot in Montecito, told People magazine spokesperson of California Road Watch.
The witness stated that around 16.30 a.m. Locklear "streaked hard on the gas, merging forward and back behind and trying to get out of the parking place - she repeatedly ran over the sunglasses while retreating".
The witness who apparently didn't recognize the actress first saw Locklear's moment after he stopped at the nearby highway and got off the vehicle.
This person also called attention to the emergency service because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found an actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disorientated," and that's why the members took her to a specialised drug and alcoholic center to be tested.
According to the police spokesperson, the actress cooperated and an excessive amount of alcohol was subsequently excluded, yet "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was apparent to the officers at first sight".
Locklear was arrested for suspected proceedings under the influence of the effects of a closer non-specific substance and was taken into custody around 19.00, although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a medical clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists on the Andalusian association of IU to exercise its powers in the case of Silva
The chief of the IU and Member of the Joint Left Gaspar Llamazares today announced that the final decision in the case of the former Youth Council Department and the City Hall Sport in Seville Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being charged with the negotiations for the benefit of his family, will depend on the regional association of the parties.
"I am an overly federalist, and it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," said Llamazares, who the party will have to proceed with in relation to a former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that, in the case of an investigation into the illegal conduct of which Silva had committed, it is absolutely necessary "transparency": "IU has always fought for such matters to be as transparent as possible."
Similarly, he stressed that the party had a 'stractical ethical code for all public functions'.
"Flower Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garcia in the film "Mayn Blood" (Sangre de mayo), inspired by Episodes from the national past by Benita Pérez Galdós, revives the famous Spanish Uprising against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around EUR 15 million.
In this way, the film maker "drawing the expression of the characters and the analysis of the society" which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the film before an extensive team of performers.
May's blood will be measured over two and a half hours into the cinemas this Friday, and in the future there will be more than a four-hour TV series Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdós José Luis Garcia claims that by filming this film, he fulfilled the "child's dream", for which he owed Esperanza Aguirre, who had commissioned him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid by filming a film for the two-th anniversary of Madrid on May 2nd, he accepted the offer that the story would be based on the National Past Epizod.
The budget of 15 million, on which Madrid's province has fully contributed, means to Garcia's "one opportunity" to create an environment with the scenes and costumes corresponding to the image of the "thirsty Spain, which was wrong in the leader for whom it was possible to fight - the struggle for independence led to the collapse and stature of the country under the government of Ferdinand VII," he said.
The director regrets, however, that he cannot count on the financial support that had been given to the films of the Sad Wing (Ala triste) or Goy's Miracles - almost twice as much of May's blood - so he could not make some of the scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horace Valcárcel, with which he works almost all the way along his film path.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and empezar) works as he is commonly used - on the stage with actors with whom he usually tries before filming and who does not choose casting because he feels "resisting" and also thinks that "a part of the director's profession is to go to theatres and cinemas and so learn what is going on in the craft he deals with".
Many actors who have chosen for May’s blood appear before his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, with four nominations for Oscar, one of whom he got, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, May blood alone, seven tables of French billiards and the last selected Blind Sunshines, does not represent a young generation of Spanish film scenes, but claims that "this one will yet appear".
Garcia expects no award for this film.
"At first you think you're working for what's gonna happen next, but then you realize you're only working for earnings, so you're going to make another movie," she explains Garcia with more than a 30-year-old director's career.
Isabel Bayón resurrects the spiritual legacy of the Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
The Sevilla flamenca dancer will pay tribute to another Sevilla dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of the father of the Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and when she was three years old, they moved to London with their family.
She danced modern dance and focused on the oriental dance.
She lived a life of passion, pioneered female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the abolition of a corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
This woman's life, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, was enchanted by Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she designed this character for me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we're not talking about telling her life, we're talking about catching a soul.
Her performance names reminded me of flamenco's rhythms.
So the butterfly dance evocated me guajiru or "the snake dance" some thong.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic also fits," she claims.
The performance consists of the involvement of two extraordinary personalities: with Miguel the Guide, who will sing Isabel in one performance as well as in the "Open Door" (La puerta abierta), and with the teacher of the dance Matilde Coral, who made an exception and joined in cooperation with her former student.
"Matilde represents the older Tórtola, the mature character.
I'm happy she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honor to me."
The performance also includes the music and guitars of Jesúse Torres and Paca Arriaga, singing by Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; drums of El Pájara, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the co-operation of the actor Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are primadons with everything and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who has been going on for her time in places as far as India, the United States or Russia are, and also throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some point, but no one knows her today and even less appreciates her work," says Bayón.
The show starts today at 8:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "New-Married Diary" also closes triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of the "New York Day of the Fresh Married" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the autonomous Andalusian Government at the celebration of the "Zenobie and Juan Ramona Triennial" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature and the anniversary of their death.
"The Zenobie and Juan Ramona Triennial" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress that will take place in New York City, a repair of the Nobel Museum House and a travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Sun Ray", which was opened in May this year, and after it goes around the various Andalus provinces, it should move to New York as planned at the time of the congress.
The cultural council of the autonomous Andalus government also ordered eight hundred copies of the "New-Married Diary" prepared by Pedre Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread the awareness of the personality and works of one of the most holy Andalus poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like each other that much anymore.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who cooperated with him on "Without evil intent" and under the weight of consciousness that Newman left, revealing her unconsolidated vision of abandoned American cinematography and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And that he retired from 2007.
And it was known that he was severely ill.
Even so, he was a big guy for all of us.
"Sometimes what you feel cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
Father of film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-esteem is at the bottom of a desperate search for reasons of pride.
When times are rough and people without virtue and just a handful of people worth admiring - there's no need to be Luis Cernud to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodimented almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from the drug addiction foundation based on the honor of the firstborn son who died of overdose to his own brand of homemade food and biofood.
A complete treasure for a country worth a lot of effort to free itself from a suicide food culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, said that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, the holder of the Oskar under the direction of Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without exaggeration at the top of his career.
A bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, called himself the troufle of Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"This fox has put a pretty high bar on us all," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman lived today - based on honesty and leads a serious private life far from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, these people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and ever since he was married to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, even though he had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a burger when I have a filet at home?" I like to joke.
May his pride be drawn in heaven to the fact that there is a harmony between his daughters and his admirers on earth - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles that he has incarnate, he was most proud of the role of a dedicated husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a self-sacrific philanthropist."
The Imperal Races of the Madrid Olympics
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the failed 2012 it will be possible to 2016.
But I say, are we ready?
If we follow the race last night, I say, no!
He was referred to as the perfect race, and according to my trial, he was the worst I've ever been on.
Such a load of nonsense that, right now, if it were to be evaluated and I was a tester, it would be clear enough.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one at a time.
Nonsense starts picking up a racing number that's why you need to leave early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when a person goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip to prevent the overflow).
Oh, no.
Here you had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after the appropriate front) - what a surprise! - only had a T-shirt size S (the second nonsense because I need the size of XL).
Where do we live?
Is this because of the crisis they've decided to buy little T-shirts because it's less fabric and it's cheaper?
All right, well, these are the little things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon for the chip and the queue lasted for it for over 15 minutes, he had to turn in the backpack there.
Over 35 minutes, the waiting time has taken place, which is in a race where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as you could expect, the race started, and we haven't put our bags away yet, and once we've made it, it's been a lot worse picking up.
Moreover, the waiting extended the rain by 40 minutes, leading to a general riot and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have an inflammation of the trachea tomorrow and some like me will not show up at the right time to evaluate the results for the chip they gave me and which, I suppose, did not record the right start time.
Of course, if anyone asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of that one.
And so I think we're gonna have to keep the Olympic city well-prepared.
Microsoft looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction on the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic actions such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move around the entire area of society) and perceived what he heard in the interview.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionary" can determine how many people are in the room who are - even remember what they're wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also sort the present ones out by conversational groups.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist records the third person and understands that he does not belong to the group he talks to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going to see anyone, and she's telling her she's going to take care of her in a minute.
All that without a blue screen of death.
That's amazing.
But, of course, that's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot has been said this week about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without burdening commercial waste, they would be five times more efficient - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as a thunder, considering that Microsoft version of the version adds new features to Windows and other "extra".
A change of direction would be a good act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who tended to the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as absolute truth, but relative to the truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay more and less attention to the operating system and vice versa to more web browsers.
The computer turns on to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around the windows.
What does half the applications that link the system serve?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here I have a small example.
I took this photograph in one of the restrooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the drinking machine that begs them to use their search tools: "Your search, our future."
In 2006, she showed an independent study that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search.
Last week, by the way, the delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count until the end of 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone's becoming more and more computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Azure Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one glow in the "Blood Diamond" of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in the "Blood" of Francis Ford Coppola, and in addition to being part of a uniformly muscular gay community.
And if we want to go into reading his life's roles, we can dive into the image of a typical muscle with a pointy mustache that lifts the weight in a noose circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical man's underpants, tight and sleeveless.
The English spokesmen call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above everyone else.
First of all, for his short name - even though he is referred to as 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as the legend tells, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lovers of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (almost unknown) Belgian flag, which models of the most emblimating shirts as detailed around the neck.
And be careful, because a Belgian company doesn't only specialize in tank tops.
He also makes college hoodies, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, Navy T-shirts, baby clothes, mini shorts...
Invented pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
A tremendous image with her sister did not prevent her development of her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though small, is a woman of life.
They're taking the Cruz sisters very seriously now.
For Mónica, it means a lot more than just some pretty, famous girls lend their name.
In Paris, Mango took part in the promotion event in her new headquarters, as well as in the announcement of the most important fashion prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's both hearty and shy, and she's about to get you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection, which I proposed for Mango for the autumn-winter season with Sister Penélope, while also attending the announcement of the second year of "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honour of Valentina.
So it was a demanding but exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I are in love with films from the '50s and '60s, and we've drawn a lot of stimuli from them.
I also love to wander around town and watch women walk around dressed up, combining and layering their clothes, that's what I do very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
Maybe I liked my clothes when I was almost there, and I still wanted to go to my grandmother's, talk about my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was fantastic, almost better than going to the pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to keep an eye on my clothes.
You know, we dancers base on how we adapt to feel good about our clocks and tests in the mirror.
And as an actress, if they give you a costume, then you really get into character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You recently 30 years old, have you been hit by a crisis?
No way.
I feel better than I ever felt before, I'm enjoying my 30s.
I find that a woman is already finished, has experience, and enjoys life with less mistakes.
Biological hours don't scare me.
I've been doing what I want since I was little, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother because my body wants to be, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I'm going to give my child a feeling of happiness and I'm going to raise him with great love.
As far as the movie is concerned, there are a few prime minister films that you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to coming to the movies.
I come from the theatre world, so I'm very impatient and restless, everything I want right now, and I can't do that.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última mountain" and "En busa de la tumba de Cristo".
See how you like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the parade pier by Naomi Campbell's side, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going up the pier like a model.
Only Naomi Campbell called me, whom I have known for a long time, and invited me to London to take part in the benefit show for her organization "Women for a Better Life", and the clothes we've been doing - I also chose two models from our collection for Mango - the proceeds were auctioned and the proceeds were handed over to this Naomi's NGOs.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There's a lot of things about her, and I, because I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good stuff she's getting involved in.
She asked me to show for charity, but if she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
To the benefit of third-world women, I will do what is needed.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior demands that the driver with three administrative sanctions for driving under the influence of alcohol must have installed in his car a system that prevents him from starting a car in drunkenness or if he does not breathe.
The proposal came into being as early as June of this year and is now included in the annual report by the Supreme State Office, according to which it is a pilot project, which will take one year.
Its aim is to return the driver to the steering wheel, therefore drivers will also have to take the course of transport re-entry.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Car Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics between 30 and 75 % of the car drivers accused more than once in drunkenness will again sit behind the steering wheel in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breathable air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if the alcohol concentration is higher than the permitted.
His price exceeds EUR 1,000 and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
The study carried out in this sense in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices decreased their infringements by 65 % during the first year following the introduction.
Spain is expected to save 115 lives each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to help implement it, since legislation can be implemented in a normal way, however, the necessary provisions of criminal law need to be amended by law.
The facility is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been tested in certain industrial cars and public service vehicles.
It is tomorrow that Congress will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spain Socialist Party) in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 17.40 hours, as it was in the program, it landed in the presidential hangar at Benita Juárez Airport in México D. F. airplane of Spanish Air Forces, in which the prince and princess of Asturia arrived.
The sun had just sung, but its rays had so far forced their hands to cover their eyes to see the subsequent couple coming out of the plane.
There was a Spanish ambassador and other officers under the meetings.
A few hours ago, I asked the cab driver if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were coming to visit the state.
- Yeah, well, that's great, then it won't be able to get to the airport to recruit people... she's from here or whatever...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's it...
But the Mexican press knows well who the prince and princess of Asturia are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport right next to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 marine soldiers ready to shoot an honest salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a suit of dark blue color and a princess, very lightly dressed and with shattered hair, does not have its usual "peeptoes", apparently reported a storm in D. F.
Before they move into the O.R. room, where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and relentlessly forget them.
At the hotel door where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in town, there is a talkative Mexican television reporter waiting for them.
Best Grantd Fashion Price
Probably not the world's best place to announce a fashionable price than Paris, and probably not a better designer and a bonvivan than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to allow the international presentation of new talent in fashion.
The price is subsidised by an amount of EUR 300,000.
Belgian Sandra Beani, winner of the first year, looked at her proposals yesterday in Manga's window on the Haussmann boulevard of Paris, number 54, crying almost as if she had reached the finish.
Sure, it's the second largest store of this company in Europe and it was just opened on an area of 1 335 square meters.
The biggest is in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank the designers of Valentin for taking up the Presidency of the Competition jury, have finally made us a delicious dinner at the Paris Garnier Opera.
Mango's solemnly decorated chairing table looked even more amazing next to Chagall's most famous works.
Nati, who was heartbroken because of her brother's recent death, did not reveal anything, put on this brand's dress and Elah's jewels, over which he hid his breath, and hanged in her son Luis - almost two-meter-foot-elegan - accompanied Valentina at the head of the table at dinner to honor him.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took the welcome and, as a true gentleman, stayed with Baron Rothschild without a jacket because they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - custom-designed - pants and shirt, and at dinner she changed into long black sexy dresses, finished the night walk on the Opera behind Goya Toledová's escort, showed us the hall for ballet tests and, in memory of other times, she caught one of the bars and suggested "grand plié".
Inés Sastre didn't stay for a tour of the palace's side buildings, but she showed us pictures of her son on her cell phone before she left.
The next morning we could love Olivier Martínez's presence - another young man who drives a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who came to the hotel in Paris with his own linen and towels and asked that no scent be used in his rooms.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001-anti-stress number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget about a chaotic and frenzy everyday life.
And in order not to be too little, they are all summarised in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm rings every morning at 7 a.m. as punishment, but even worse it is to imagine yourself absorbed in the rushing rhythm that brings present life.
The office is called suspense and computer back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
However, there is not one or two ways to fight daily exhaustion and the problems of getting away from the world of work.
No, that number is no bigger than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside the Yogi position, classical massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book, gathered the whole "menu" options, adjusted according to the taste and time options of each individual.
Protistres' book is called "1001 Way of Relaxation", and thanks to the publishers of Pearson Alhambra and DK it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If anyone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relations, the "guide" denies this view.
In addition, it offers additional procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins that re-establishs balance in your body, and stress became a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Talking From Sleeping
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while sleeping.
When it first happens, it may scare you, but it doesn't really matter.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilovia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure they told one of you that he was talking out of sleep at night.
This phenomenon may occur very occasionally (for example once a day with high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the next day, the child does not remember anything.
There's only one reason why she's here to explain.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night birches, enuresis nighttime (night wetting) or sleepwalking, but it may not be so.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stress, or upset situations.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
A child can speak with a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases of great strength, it would be appropriate to observe and consult with an expert to see if he has any problem that causes great anxiety and thus manifests himself.
We have said that this is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by bearing in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the baby too much before going to bed.
So search for peaceful games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV shows or TV shows.
In very nervous children and those who can work to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
That kid's gonna make it easier to sleep.
When the somnilovia appears, try to stay calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child, and that from what was done, the next day will no longer remember.
Useful advice
Don't be.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're gonna interrupt his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and so he rests.
Remember, it would be appropriate to ask for advice or to find out what is causing such anxiety in a child several times.
If you understand what he says (which is not customary), avoid the temptation to question him and draw information from him.
It won't do any good, because when she's asleep, she's not conscious that she can arrange her thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he thinks, and therefore why he says it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come up with.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even fun.
It's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don't worry, it's not a bad thing, it's just an episode that takes just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory after a long, skinny period.
Without playing a particularly large game, the yellow-black team created more chances and managed to transform one of them.
The game did not have too fast pace during this encounter, in which the attackers were just hard to enforce.
After the first attempt of Captain Kauffmann, who by far missed the link, began to have Illhaeusern slightly on top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to irritating the defense of Dannemarie.
On the other hand, he built a field of defensive Val and left only agile Riahi on the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, thanks to the two chances of Dannemaria with the names of Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which Marais took care of, well located for processing the ball reflected after the previous Diebold experiment (53).’
But Golman Illhaeusern did not enjoy the pleasure for long, and after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room to leave his teammates at a weakening time.
But Dannemarie couldn't recover from it, and eleven of the Illhaeusern, who just pulled out a little to "threw" the defense, no longer caused any more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball passed through very close to March.
Sarkozy goes towards angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
To face the demonstration of the forces of fishermen, who strongly disrupted the accessibility of several Venetian and Norse ports on Monday, the French president decided to go to Guilvinec port in Finistère to meet their representatives there on Tuesday morning.
The last nominees promised to be accepted "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that "he would come up with concrete proposals".
The President's visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen, in order to obtain measures against a sharp increase in oil prices, which reached a peak of more than EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to the spokesperson of the Elysian palace of David Martinon, the president will "talk about solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions for the employment and payment of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with relentlessness.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation of a "hombus" (operation of slowly moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic.
The holiday port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections in the direction to Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filter dam was opened on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors demonstrated their determination on Monday, when the tyres and pallets burned in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc at dawn before the port fuel warehouses in Brest and Lorinta, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel of La Manche, as to the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where there were troulers left in the port, or to Le Havru, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of the ships.
Fishers from Turballe and from Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of important refineries of Total in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decide to act for themselves until Wednesday at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" is to decide on how to continue the road ahead, and on its participation in the forthcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the State Fisheries Department who did not support their movements.
"The stand will continue" because "fishers will not abandon anything" and "they do not want to come to Paris", said, for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorent Fisheries Department.
However, fishermen who do not pay oil tax are currently around 50 cents per litre, consider that the threshold for ship yield is only reached when oil is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
An unforgettable representative of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes, also worshiped the legend of the film and politically involved actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer retains its supply assumptions for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on the supply of 215 aircraft, despite the threat of recession that rises above the world economy.
The fourth air designer in the world, Embraer, maintains his supply assumptions for 2008 with 215 added instruments, confirmed by his president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, in particular taking into account the range of his planes from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered 41 instruments to Chinese clients in the range of eight years.
AIG is said to consider sending 15% of its assets
The American International Group’s insurance company, which the U.S. money authorities received over water, is considering moving more than 15% of its assets in order to pay $85 billion in advance, writes the Financial Times Sunday.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, specifying the journal, which quotes the resources of the near-open negotiations.
According to France Télécom, the Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday during the evening to investigate the possible deployments.
AIG has not been able to obtain any confirmatory statement.
The assets which AIG intends to dispose of include its subsidiary of International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and investment in private equity, are supplied by France Télécom.
No final decision on these delegations has yet been taken; France Télécom is continuing.
AIG needs to get cash quickly in order to repay the 85 billion loan provided by the Federal Reserve Bank with the risk that the US authorities will seize 80% of its capital, thus also dilute it to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historical meeting Morning Meeting
New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's rescue plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9,14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points at 10 365.45 points.
The biggest point-by-point decline in its history (by 684,81 points) recorded on September 17, 2001 on the day of the resumption of trade after the 11th September terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technological component lost, according to definitive data after the trade closure, 199,61 points and settled to 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points.
Depressed since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street literally fell apart after the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the Bank of the House of Representatives, a plan which was intended to enable a little stability to be re-discovered in the markets.
The 228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to grant the Secretary of State Treasury Henry Paulson the funds he asked for.
Almost two Republicans in three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market that sees Congress not being able to adopt a certain plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market has relied on this plan," she added and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days did not "too late".
"If this project is truly doomed (...), the staff will immediately be handed over to the Fed (American Central Bank, note red.) and to the other central banks to instigate the crisis, which would strengthen the credit conditions more," pointed Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight economist.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States "every new day brings a fall of one financial institution".
After Friday’s crash, Washington Mutual organized the authorities to buy out Wachovia’s bank activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly took shape and demanded urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that the markets do not deal with "only the American crisis but with the world crisis" provided an analyst from FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The revenue from the cashier for 10 years decreased to 3,632 % compared to 3,827 % on Friday evening, the return for 30 years to 4,161 % compared to 4.357 % of the previous day.
Obama won the points in the first television duel
Following the first Friday debate between the two White House candidates, the second debate was followed by the task of finding out who of the two John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The command tents of the Republicans and Democrats were not surprised when both declared their victory in the television duel that watched a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, however decent, was not enough "brillant" to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a drop in the polls.
Gallupa’s Institute, whose public opinion survey published on Saturday marks Obama’s five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), considers the Democrat to be the winner of the duel.
Among the undecided voters who are concerned, Obama is a 39% winner, while, according to the CBS survey, 25% attaches victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the intended good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden during the first and only public debate with his opponent Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She is gifted," said Bill Clinton on the weekend.
Seventies McCain has consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naitivity" of his opponent on issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"It seems Senator Obama did not understand that..." there were repeated charges.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
In such an offensive spirit, there was a Republican television spot yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represented the future.
He didn't lose his head, and he turned out to be brief and precise.
He stressed his ability to make the right decisions and restore the reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't understand, while Obama did," he said on the weekend a democratic spot which tells the Republican that he is not taking enough into account the impact of the crisis on the "ordinary American".
"The ninety-minute debate of this John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday before the 20 000 people gathered at the North Carolina election meeting for a violent rain.
The financial decomposition clearly favours Obama, whom the Americans consider more capable of saving the economy at the edge of the abyss.
"The next week could be a decisive twist," said President Charles Schumer yesterday.
The democratic representative of Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to the one Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of an eight-year-old bad economic policy, as operated by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
The Senator from Illinois confirmed again that despite the unexpected jumps of Wall Street, he should be able to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans, and he also pointed out that the implementation of the country's potential energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is its priority number one, along with the introduction of the health insurance system.
McCain is planning to build another park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided the questions concerning the 700 billion-dollar financial assistance plan (EUR 470 billion) adopted by Congress last night, which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice that there were elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night on the main square of the city of Belarus in order to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night immediately after the closing of the electoral rooms on the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularness of elections to the parliament.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, demise".
Some admit that they didn't even go to the elections: "What would it be for if they did what they wanted with my voice anyway," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been accommodating to foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to take a turn towards democracy.
Penalties, which include the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian sexes and the freezing of certain assets, could be repealed if the elections are considered as pure.
According to the opposition, it wasn't.
"We were kept away from the electoral committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census," complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," notes Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and the leading figure of the pro-European movement, "the music is important, who's counting votes, and in our country, it's powerful power.
If any opposition Members make their way to Parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
Their accession to Parliament may, however, be a space for television, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because " dialogue with the European Union needs to be launched.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is affected by the crisis and we are not reforming ourselves, we are threatened to become a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been monitoring the course of elections, should not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of an early vote (26% of the vote in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What about you, have you noticed that there have been elections?" asks social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no leg in the election rooms.
And there will be at most five opposition Members in Parliament, those who comply most with the regime."
The night's silence again took place in the square of October.
On TV, President Lukashenko and the members of the central electoral committee congratulate themselves on success.
Interview - Blood, which is again certain
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of the founding and its president, Dr Francine Décary, was rightly pleased because Hema-Québec became one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after a scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is commonly known, the state blood reserve managed by the Red Cross Transfusion Department of Canada was contaminated with the HIV virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the wave, the Canadian government opened a public investigation in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, with the aim of explaining the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and of making recommendations not to reoccur.
While Judge Krever missed the report, some provinces put in motion a committee with the aim of planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québek, this role was played by Gélinea's committee.
After Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec, who was supposed to run Québec, and the Canadian blood company to supply all provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec started his activities in 1998, only 38% of the people still had confidence in the Québeck blood system," recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was daunting.
With continuous efforts to increase the safety of blood products and work in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence," he says, proudly, that at the beginning of 2008 Hema-Québek trusted almost 94% of the Québek population.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its founding on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
"At that time, we have seen many cases of human disease of mad cow in Europe, a new variant of disease called Creutzfeldt-Jacob’s disease," says the woman who has led society since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea whether this disease could spread through blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krevere and Gélineau report, according to which, if we do not know this and when there is a risk of serious illness spread, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jacob’s disease, which is characterised by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, it is necessary to take exclusion measures.
In April 1999, therefore, we rejected blood from people who have been staying in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely demonstrated that this disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that keeping to the principle of prudence made sense."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique appeared on the market for the detection of HIV: tests using nucleic acid (NAT), which allow the presence of the virus itself in the donor blood, rather than the presence of antibodies on which the tests used previously were based.
NAT tests have allowed to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the moment of the patient's infection and the moment when the first viruses may be discovered by our blood techniques, explains the specialist.
We've been able to shorten this period for less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk of some donors being infected without knowing it, and without even finding out.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV is today exposed to one of 12 million people.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products every year, it will take 24 years for HIV to be transmitted through the blood product.
I believe that today we can completely obtain or prescribe blood transfusions necessary to heal," says the head of management of Héma-Québek.
"The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what kind of disease the system might be.
Just last year, a virus of chiungunya appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transferred to the blood by stabbing insects.
We need to be constantly cautious," Dr. Décary continues, stressing that, in addition to safe supply, Hema-Québec must also count on sufficient supply.
"The needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for a blood donor network, which on average consists only of 3% of Québecans allowed to donate."
Every healthy person aged at least 18 years, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, which means six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not on average accepted because they are, for example, carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where mud colds are running, they are excluded for one year.
"With these 3% we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Weaknesses are very rare.
However, the donors’ network should be supplemented in proportion to how old they are and cannot donate blood anymore.
However, convincing people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so indecent today that we will rarely find an hour to donate blood," Francine Décary will.
With the annual budget of $297 million Hema-Québec not only supplies blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eye tube and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Québek, which also manages the only public blood bank from the cord in Québek.
The umbilical cord previously regarded as biomedicine waste is flowing with blood rich in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousands of blood samples from the cord to the bank, and we assume that we will be taking them over a thousand a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplantation," says Dr. Décary, who describes the blood collection program from the umbilical cord as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all the hospitals in Québek.
Football - Impact in semifinal
The impact of Montréal yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final played on the total number of goals qualified into the semi-final round of the first division of USL, thanks to the victory 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over Sounders of Seattle.
Deputy Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive goal in the 90th minute game.
After the two-parted first half were sown by David Testo and Rocco Plancentino the remaining two goals of the Montreal Formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could deal with Matt Jordan in favor of Sounders.
Remind me that on Friday, during the first of the two matches, Impact suffered a quarter-final in the Starfire Complex in Tuquila in the suburbs of Seattle, defeat 2:1.
The impact will measure in the semifinal of its power with the Whitecaps of Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota Thunder settled in the home game deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, however, Whitecaps advanced to the semi-final round with the total number of goals 5:4.
Impact should meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series of matches will be confirmed today.
Shortly - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attack trio canadien is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekance and Andrei Kosticina last night in Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two assists and Kovalev collected one win in this fourth victory three-coloured of six preparatory matches.
Kovalev ensured victory by giving a single goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said Rus.
"I need one more game to make me feel good."
"In the first third he tried to handle it too much," said Guy Carbonneau.
"I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister shall not rule out early elections by the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party (Parti libéral) convention ended, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Québek, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's additional elections.
"Move away the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually enticing way at the end of the Québek Liberal Party convention in Levivis without giving details.
During his speech, images were shown behind his back in some kind of picture mill.
On three large canvases there was a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Québek from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, as in the parliamentary term.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would call for early elections in autumn, although he pointed out that he had a very busy programme.
"Plán Sever" is the fourth dimension of the vision that the Prime Minister intends for Québec, the vision of "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on the workforce, the Convention between Canada and Europe and the Agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - northern territory on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his statements recently, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "glory of great potential", but it did not mention the deadline, the amount of investment or the clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further distributed: in particular hydroelectric power plants, forests, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
The north, according to Charest's account, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "land twice as big as France is with us", "is in Québek.
And it is not only with us, but it is in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he called upon a certain national founder's myth.
Québec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, pointed out by the Prime Minister: the pursuit of gold in Abitibi, Québecké engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after he became a theatre silent to see a huge map behind his back.
The North, 70% of Québek's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which was always requested by Québec, specified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"This is a traditional approach, which has repeated all the governments of the past.
There is one border line that no longer exists for a long time, and if there is an appropriate opportunity, I will reinstate this position in the name of the government," he said.
Otherwise, "there is also a need to reconsider our vision of the North in connection with climate change," he said when talking about the north-west transition, which will open year-round as a result of the melting of the glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it to be an obligation to occupy the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the original nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Québec government would be very thoughtful and that their project would be beneficial, especially young.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist Member of Ungava) have already opened negotiations with some thirty communities.
The Interministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, has an important role as Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "joint visions will be set".
Moreover, the development of the North should take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Sever plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visa" as a continuous follow-up to the vision of liberal premieres that preceded him.
"Just like the liberals who preceded us, we changed our thinking to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This, in fact, was one of the still overcrowded topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a big cocktail, raising the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to baptize Beauharnois' headquarters at Adělard-Godbutov's dam.
"From Godbut, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who conducted a peaceful revolution and nationalization of water power, to the Bourass, who created James's cove, managed our side to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
He referred to another authority at the press conference, this time conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the replacement hydroelectric power plant Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I only say this among us, but I plan to be there," he said to his Member State base, causing a lot of applause.
The same Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility to call for elections in the autumn of this year, which allows him the law.
However, he stressed that his program was loaded, especially by the mission of the Federal Council in China and the Québec-New York Summit.
The weekend convention provided the chief liberals a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular a certain "conventing efforts to amend the constitution", which have passed very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal Party of Québek) requires in particular recognition of the "specificity of Québek" in the Constitution.
It also wants Québec to appoint a part of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Television Council, who should be entitled to a veto in the case of decisions taken in Québek.
On the side of the opposition, the Sever Plan was adopted sceptically in its main features.
Head of PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois again pulled out the North Québek Development Policy, launched by Landry's government in 2001.
According to her, when the Government of the liberals came to power in 2003, the implementation of this policy was abandoned.
If she had held her hand, "we would have moved on today", Marois said to her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) by Francoise Mercure.
ADQ said she would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"We wish it not just a theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Disappointed Country
He was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "justice" (o irony) at the Harper's cabinet, who took the liberty of saying about Louis Arbour last summer that he was a shame to Canada.
In this way, a woman who has led an unscrupulous struggle for justice, and who deserves all our admiration, tells many of the prime minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government in front of us, which, as the only of all the Western countries involved, has not transferred its national back to the country of Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account that at the time when the actions that have been mentioned to him were Omar Khadr's young adolescent.
The only government that, although Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and rots in the inhuman conditions of a child soldier.
The only one relying on a parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Remind us that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and especially the Association of Canadian Advocates, advocate the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that he can wait for a fair trial in Canada.
The same government shuts its eyes before torture: it does not matter that this young man is psychologically destroyed in the future, and it certainly lasted, after so many years of suffering.
We do not realize it, but we are just witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the words that Harper is so leaning on and which sounds so empty out of his mouth.
A time has come when there is no more morals: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, treat him badly, trap him according to any kind of boss until now minority government (as will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation on the side that proclaims virtue, law and order: they do not see that this government has given up what constituted the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this waiver, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwell's Discortion from Barrick Gold
In his 17th September edition, Le Devoir printed Patrick J. Garver's letter, the executive vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell's logic, it confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched a prosecution of three authors and a poor little publishing house for insults in order to create a "transparent public debate" and requires six million of them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it does not judge truthfulness, especially in the case of prosecution for insult to honor, but law.
It is no surprise that Garver is completely missing this fundamental distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate to bring anyone to the wasteland who dares defend the opposite position?
Whatever the case may be, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable amounts to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced fight against an army of lawyers supported by nearly bottomless pockets of the mining society.
Moreover, tactics in these unbalanced fears often lie in the ruin of the defendants in order to pursue conciliation, which will clog the mouth of the counter and in addition terrify anyone who dares to address this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted to have a public debate, she should have a view of the whole matter in public opinion.
In contrast to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, Canada is a debate under normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas and not in the wounds of twigs.
Therefore, the mining society was not enough to open its books, its documentation and establish a real debate through the newspapers, the media, the publications and financing of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the whole matter.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion and smah reject petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver can explain how he can demand a "public debate" while disdaining the same public?
It seems that this word in the Vice President's world refers only to fat-paid lawyers, not to all Canadians; that's a rather narrow concept of this term.
In democracy, they have the right to speak up to even the natives.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is prepared to hear Barrick and to assess the matter, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many view as prosecutions, in which the defendant's mouth is to be clogged (in the context of his prosecution of "public debate", Barrick, by the way, has just submitted an official call to the authors of Noir Canada to officially announce to them that they are to stop using this term...).
If we ignore the surreal expression of Garver, the prosecution of the initiated Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university freedom of research and the search for the truth that is essential to every democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to quote reliable resources and to debate facts and interpretations which are the very basis for intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without putting up with repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have been if it had followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He's entitled to an answer.
The university's environment that we belong to has been able to run debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s overlying action clearly shows that, despite what it claims, it is not the slightest desire to hold a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would limit such an unauthorized prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic plan since the great crisis of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, how with the US $700 billion to slow down the financial crisis that has been clouding Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over their applications, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of public money, new measures to capture the amount of houses seized due to non-payments, as well as the right to monitor the level of wages paid to managers of rescued companies.
US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, House Chairman Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representatives at the table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news a few minutes after midnight after the end of the two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the Bush administration representative, Henry Paulson.
"All things were done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans were safe from the crisis just taking place on Wall Street," explained the Democrat.
"This is a crucial point: if we don't do this, trauma, chaos and the disruption of the everyday life of Americans will be enormous," Republican Judd Gregg said.
Over the last hours, negotiations have taken place on the maximum turns of fear of the effect of further failures in the deployment of investors.
The set time limit was to open the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US president were invited to negotiate later and both expressed their preference for the agreement rather than forgetting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such a far-reaching solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added to the agreement on certain measures, in particular the aim of which is to enable owners to maintain their residence, and the measures on the wages of the leaders of the workers of the companies saved.
"When we ask the taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibleness of some people, there is nothing to congratulate on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television waves.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was questioned by another station, would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The gross features that I have read show that this is something that we all have to spend and with what it will be possible to move on.
Choring inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The aim of the 700 billion-dollar plan is to buy out doubtful claims and risk-free and non-saleable assets of US financial institutions for the taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis triggered by a bubble in the real estate market, which first led to a collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to further, more widespread forms of loans (PCAA) and resulted in cash freeze and in the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
The failure of the first draft agreement last week is borne by the Republican Members.
From the moment the Democrats agreed that some "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty will only be handed over by the government, but will not buy them, there is a belief that the impasse is being set off.
In an attempt to bring the conflicting views of Congress closer together, measures have been put in place to establish that the government will be able to introduce new charges to help it recover its contribution if it has to assume losses for a period of five years as a result of the programme.
The new plan will count on the first amount of 250 billion, which will be possible to add another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should approve Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire shares in the rescued companies, which, in case of profit, will pay him dividends and which he will be able to sell again when it's over.
The Federal Government will be given the opportunity to delay the real estate impounding procedures connected with the loans to which the plan relates, as well as to set limits for the amount of the evaluation and compensation paid to the managers of the companies affected.
The members of the plan would like to put it to the vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against this project in both republican and democratic camp.
"It is absolutely clear that Washington does not hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Financial Commission, said to the voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money on taxpayers is not the solution."
The democratic representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressmen named "the committee of skeptics", presents the whole matter differently, but the same conclusion happens.
"Four hundred respected professors of economics, among them three Nobel prizers, wrote to us: "We ask Congress not to rush too much and carefully examine which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time in Europe, it was reaffirmed that this crisis is a world crisis.
Following the conclusion of the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) due to the crisis of risk loans to buy real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is one of the twenty largest European banks and one of the top ten insurers.
"We are not going to lose this money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we acquire the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that is what organizers and households today can appreciate."
On the other hand, the Channel of La Manche seems to have begun the British Government's nationalisation of other banks affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) were loans to buy real estate.
According to his announcement yesterday, the UK bank's Spanish bank Santander will buy out its branches and accounts.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with azure eyes long represented his coffin, according to other weaknesses.
Has this American actor come out with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity and reassurance of the talents that he had owned also removed him from the power category that produces the true stars.
But what a runner on a long track!
Paul Newman died on Friday in 83 years at his ranch in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of fat American cinematography.
Less spectacular than Brando, who had been similar and long been his rival on the film screen, Newman was a more careful actor, certainly brittle, but also an apostle of freedom and the dissolution of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was German Jew and mother originated Hungarian.
One of the famous faces of the American dream was born from these European roots.
Without an exaggeration of ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because the whole country was in love with self-made mana, a warrior in the Pacific War, wounded in battle, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s, then attended the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated a triumph in the theater, on television and back in the movie.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who placed himself second at the 24 hour race in Le Mans in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, despite the fact that he created a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also go the dark places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the fuss of their own show-business, which will forever remain to some extent mysterious.
Good man, in the noblest sense.
This weekend, Paul Newman's departure caused the film lovers to be dizzy, while his great roles are competing on the black screen of memories.
After that, he has been dephilizing more than half a century of constantly transforming American seventh art.
In memory of the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on the hot roof, adaptation of Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From the less ancient past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at an advanced age by marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Pauls of Newmans have gone into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, an obnoxious, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In a sign of hatred) of Robert Wise, a role designed for James Dean, taken over after his death, which Newman introduced in a true acquaintance in 1956.
A nice gangster in the absolutely great The Sting (Poraz), Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
The bitter and vengeful pool player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same hard character in The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, which will bring him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face-riding ages, it was him.
He did it again.
In his professional course, there are various epochs.
Young people know it mainly because of the cult Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from Reggie Dunlop's role, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 at the Hudsucker Proxy, Coen's brothers.
He then closed his career with the godfather of the Irish mob in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several legends that left the craft relatively soon, Newman remained in the business for a long time, although he judged Hollywood with its properties, providences and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "a live challenge of underplaying", judging that he had pushed too much at the sawmill in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles came as a lift, the profession was not always so tender.
But the first lovers played less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumpy and desperate, whose fall and rebellion reflected in his perfect features.
As director of Newman, he revealed the little known aspect of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film, Rachel, based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence, in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the main role, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
He gave his son Scott a film Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of shame and shame.
In the outburst of the honours that the Newmans received yesterday, his great friend and former warrior Robert Redford (played together in the Sting and in the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly declared: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Graciousness, love of life, such are the main qualities of the dead actor.
If we ignore his legendary career, he also leaves a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, an independent film, an opponent to Hollywood's bankruptcy.
His likeness we were used to seeing on bottles of wine vinegar, sauce, biscuits and other foods, which may seem rather untasting to us, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his heavy childhood foundation.
So, then, rather than let him get glamorous, he's been engaged in society until the last minute.
With his five daughters he left a letter containing the following sentences: "Always and until the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor for us to follow the path of life so bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced at the invoice factory Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, October 8, the trial of János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
Politicians and their associates are, in addition to other crimes, including the counterfeiting of documents, accused of fraud committed in the long term and systematically criminal organisations, resulting in extremely significant damage.
According to the D.A., they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often supported the fulfilment of the tasks with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and self-government - in total about 65 million forints - went partly to the cash register of the Fiat Baloldal organization, partly into the pockets of individuals.
The way in which the investigating authority also informed it was based on the fact that the funds obtained in the public competition were collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual consideration and that the commitments accepted by the association had never been met.
According to the prosecution, a lot of invoices were fake.
The copies of these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, the round stamp was produced in Kiskunhalasi.
The names on which companies are to produce invoices have, among other things, decided on a circular road along the northern shore of Balaton, to which Istvána Ladose János Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, the first appointed guest house and restaurant were to be seen.
In them, he requested bills for his consumption, according to which models were then produced invoices presented in the context of public competitions published, inter alia, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and by the Government of the capital.
The invoices were mostly presented by István Lados with his partner Andras λrim, who, according to our information, most frequently wrote the reports needed to obtain the subsidies.
On his "study trip," Lados looked at one of the beers.
According to the two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, this food facility was provided for a ninety-member group of the Biztos Pont.
However, so many people, according to the manager’s statement, would suddenly not fit into this facility.
In the same way, the foundation was named Jobb Jöväért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, with the formal and content errors of the invoice issued in the summer 2002.
The guest house in Badacsonyt Two had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet a hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, it was too much to be done by the publishers of writings with a rich fantasy, even when they reported on the documents of the company dedicated to the same hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in which, according to the information provided to the State Council, the documents entitled Jobb Jövőert and Hoppá did not set up.
The head of the company Győző Farkas for hvg.hu stated that when they called him to the prosecutor's office and showed him invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the stamp in the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to the formalities, they did not agree that they accommodated a hundred people according to the invoice, there are only 11 rooms that do not have such capacity.
Furthermore, catering was also mentioned on the invoice, while their restaurants have not been in operation for a long time.
The hot invoice manufacturers did not even convince themselves that the Budapest travel agency only organizes foreign travels and, on an invoice with cash payments, which did not agree with the company's billing practice, they foolishly referred to it as a service of brokering the trip around Hungary.
In addition, as was the case during the investigation, they also stated VAT in the document, although the organisation of the journeys to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
The four documents issued by Jobb Jövőért by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, among other things, to the amount of VAT.
In addition, the "sellers" have ruined the invoice, for example, by stating in one company how it came out through the investigation of the State's Office, as an activity carried out by road transport of goods which the company originally founded on investment advice did not perform.
The invoices issued by the Agyütt Foundation and the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and the 21st association. The Shazadi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont false were also broken because of the formal deviations - the incomplete format of the invoice and the false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they would issue invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s. r.o. was from Nyiregyhaza at the time (2001) when the Group from Fiat Városért, in liquidation, was eating in her place, which is why, according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he issued the paper.
The invoices displayed consciously
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew they were to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for approximately four million Forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the Fiat Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták organization.
The management company Collab s. r. o. has, according to the prosecution, forced one of the accused Ludovic Györfi to issue a fictitious account.
Zusklag and its partners also cooperated with Biogate s.r.o. on, currently in liquidation, which supplied to the Jobb Jöväért and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő Foundation in 2003 invoices worth approximately five million forints, for which there was no real economic activity.
Even the movement of money, because the invoices were cancelled later, which has already been forgotten by the organisations in their documents.
Other groups of billing companies include those who had links to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the authorised representative of the Ukrainian executive of Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with the trading of fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005 the company issued a number of invoices for the sale of computer technology resources worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found in the investigations, the Kiskunhasian Cash Investment s.r.o., which has been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man from Romania who was supposed to pass out papers concerning Ivan Kubatov in the years 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the Atlas, Hoppá and the Agyütt and Harmadik Évezredért and accepted their consideration.
In effect, at the request of Ivan Kubatov, the Romanian wallers were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
Indeed, neither of the companies did work, according to the defendant because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, he was benefitted by the companies, since, at the request of Zsolt Szente, a fellow defendant who also prepared their application papers, he issued invoices on behalf of the Atlas and Y-Generació associations linked to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Cuba 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The D.A. considered that Kubatov had arrived at 10 percent of the amounts on invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time to tender for the Biztos Pont association, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006, the Y-Generació and Szövetség and Modern Magyarszágért submitted proposals for the competition of the Mihálye Tancsicse Foundation (TMA), a public benefit of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500 000 forintech, but they did not spend the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order not to reveal this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found at a home tour in Arpad Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
During the screening, part of the defendants are likely to describe the course of production of invoices, as already done at the prosecution.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant János Zuschlag decides to reveal everything.
His statement to date is not too detailed, and even though he has promised several times that he will interpret everything widely, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, 50 million forints, perhaps the socialists made a deal with him, and Zusus will take it on himself.
In fact, he may have been offended so far because his requests for relief of his detention conditions, namely for placing in house arrest, have not yet been heard.
While perpetrators of economic crimes, who have done much more damage than they have yet to do, can freely walk or at least wait for the end of their conduct in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology of trumpeting: why are we spending more money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money overestimating goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this known - and seemingly irrational - behavior has been revealed to researchers in Neurology and Economics of the University of New York.
According to their study, published in Science magazine, people do not want to fall in the eBay auction competition, so they would rather pay too high a price.
Research was using an experimental auction to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers planted, the second group participated in the played auction, and using the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the experimental persons were examined.
In both games, the participants could win money, but in a game of auctioning, the important element of which is to trump the other side, the whole of the brain’s cortex, called the stratum, began to work intensively in losing.
In addition to many other functions, this brain area plays a role in the "security" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, it is possible, according to the researchers, to explain the effort to avoid a sharp reaction of the striata.
To support their theory, members of the research team from among economists carried out a financial cross-sectional investigation.
Under different conditions, three groups were biding against one partner.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product and they made bets.
In addition, members of the next group were promised that if they came out of the game winning, they would get another $15 reward.
On the other hand, the third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, always in the fact that one was highlighted by winning and losing.
However, the members of the group playing "anti-crime" were willing to go higher than they were in the control and "winn" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
These have so far explained the phenomena observed in the auctions by the joys of victory and by avoiding risk.
When the neurological imaging methods helped us to resolve the contradiction between these two theories so that we have now reached the third explanation," said Andrew Schitter, professor of the New York University of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to find a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is reported among the major causes of death.
The number of home cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are being treated because the sick often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, inflammation of the liver and jaundice is symptomatic, but the originators of the disease and the disease caused by them vary from one another.
The hepatitis virus is spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E by digestive tracts (e.g. infected with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood and body fluid viruses (sperma, vaginal secret, saliva).
Travellers should in any case be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, the vaccine does not exist against virus C.
Signs of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after ingestion of an infected meal, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, compulsive vomiting.
After this, the skin and eye whites form a jaundice, light stool and darkens the urine. The treatment may take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die of more serious disease, liver cancer, and hepatic cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only every tenth of the infected patients are medically treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to hepatic cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected with their disease don't even know, the pathogen destroys liver cells in an intracranial way, and so the first symptoms come in many cases only in 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, regular write-down is very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than on average: among people who had undergone blood transfusions before 1991, between drug users and between people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C is 200 million.
Since the disease can prove a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his or her doctor if he or she notices any symptoms of unknown origin.
In early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infectiousity and preventing cancer.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, which was organized worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by these viruses, its causes and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Who believes in God, doesn't hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic that could ease death to Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, researched how faith in the god of perception of pain affects a person, informed the British daily Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electrical shocks, while they all observed the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to the technology that studied the human brain in detail, Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that was responsible for regulating the pain.
Research is the first of a series of research involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The exact test was carried out in such a way that the left hand of the test subject was attached to the sparking tool that issued electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to try to closely observe two paintings: the Sassoferrat Virgin Mary of the 17th century and the Lady of Leonard da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that looking at the Virgin Mary would bring about a certain state of piety among the believers, while Da Vinci’s picture was chosen because they did not differ from the first and act according to them calming impression.
Test subjects spent half an hour in MRI scanner, and during that period they received in four consecutive parts of 20 electroshocks, while they separately watched a picture with religious or general themes.
Catholics reported that they felt "safe" when they looked at the Virgin Mary, as if they had been taken care of and "settled, filled them with peace".
They felt 12 percent less pain in watching the picture with religious themes than when they had Leonard’s work ahead.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved through any strongly impressive image even by atheists, only the right photograph should be found.
"We would have to find a picture that will be very positive, from a mother or father's position," the psychologist said.
The English bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
"Practication of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on regulating the pain of believers if they showed them a madon from Leonard or a painter similar to a calibre.
Would the view of the quality of the Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You're what you're gonna share
On his tenth birthday, Google can declare that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they were on vacation, what professional exams and what interests them.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's managers, that's still not enough.
Of course, as for skeptics, making parallels with Orwell's dark vision, these are not clearly the very essence of the site 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently commented for the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for Google's founders to hold on to their original intention, which he said: "Let's arrange all the information in the world!"
According to Google, even after ten years of global labor, the company is only at the start of working with all information.
On the question of what will be the next five years, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what work would actually be useful for me?" - but on such seemingly simple questions, software will not be able to answer until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users know well that the exact words from which IP addresses were sought and on which pages interested in the search are being moved.
With Personalized Search started two years ago, for example, users can preserve their surfing history, look back at what they've been looking for and what they've been looking for, so in the long-term perspective they're generating finds adapted to much more directly to them - the same logic will be based also on Recommendations, through which the system will be offering us products and services based on previously mentioned and preserved preferences.
What if my data are used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm doing? - ask users who are afraid when looking at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company, the counter-reaction does not cause guilt in Internet users, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even mutiny against power.
However, it is confirmed that all the terms sought are not only captured, but, in justified cases, may also be issued by a third party, in such legal cases, the rights of users of the Internet do not protect anything.
The most famous example of recent times was probably coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the community web site Orkut, established through it.
However, Internet users who are concerned about personality rights could still breathe in May when the company’s hand in hand with the organisation for the protection of electronic rights of the EFF has successfully proved its truth in the dispute with the FBI: Google must not, in the future, be forced by any article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought nearly 50,000 websites and thousands of wanted expressions, which it obtained with appeal to strengthen years ago adopted by the Act on the Protection of Children, yet it failed to get lists of wanted items of individual users, respectively complete lists of websites and key words covering a period of two months.)
Google’s view is quite different: it is beaten by those who fear the provision of their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by starting to use Google’s services, exposed to harm, and acting against it with a revolution that belongs to multinational companies with conservative image.
And so far, America's geek culture and its wild cleavage, bringing together enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, seeing in it a new generation of large-scale, "corporations that are now spinning", unlike its rival Microsoft, considered for Windows as conquerors of the world, as they both fight for the same goals.
This can be caused by Google, unlike Microsoft, not requiring its users' identification code and not asking for money for their applications; open, free and constantly fresh source of information and software package acts as a much more accessible, youthier, "cooler" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, it can also be caused by the fact that geeks understand precisely the problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which brought with them just one of the most syllable keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave behind and use the communication channels that we have at our disposal, and although their scope is different, the substance remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can keep a profile right on a few community pages from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or thelast.fm app, which records the music he listens to, then he can connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, besides he can write a blog on which he automatically appears his latest photo gallery, which he stores on Flickru or Picasso.
At the same time, we can read about a lot of examples of which it shines: a friend in the morning looking at the flood of photos of his friends will easily figure out who her crazy friend spent the evening with, or the company can fire a worker just because he will express his sincere opinion of the head of the world on his blog: one thing is for sure, the concept of private life has been totally re-evaluated today.
Whoever lives online in life consists of what he shows out of himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoids the Google Monopoly has the option (beginning for Sc000m, who uses Google's search system, but deliberately leaves no traces).
A small number of people, for example, are not registered on community sites to be found. Online Google applications from text editor to photoeditor and the news portal can be replaced as alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which of us does not build the best possible profile.
Public opinion does not secretly expect Google to show teeth.
The company's current value is $156 billion greater than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten investment by advertising agencies and services introduced at a steady pace seriously make life more difficult not only for Microsoft but also for many other software designers.
However, critical observers also find counterpoints that act as disturbing impressions: for example, the head management completely rejected employee protests after raising the corporate school fee twice, any frequent daily daily meals were too expensive according to the management of the company, but all of this is lost in addition to the fact that Google had leaned before the Chinese government in 2006 and, within the meaning of their agreement, filter out any finding that is of good taste and respect for the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years can move the world in new places: while some believe that Google project focused on scanning and archiving books and magazines acquires such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court, others are terrified of its health system, in which we can establish a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database, then it can serve as a good starting material for the following generations of sci-fi writers, the famous novel Cory Doctorow "Scxed" describes with Orwell's reminiscences the future in which it can be easily approached to man only with the help of Google data.
Two-time killers from OdZ helped remove the traces of two juveniles.
Two juveniles were questioned by the police in the case of double homicide in Odóz, and, according to reasonable suspicion, they helped remove the traces of this crime, said on Tuesday the spokesperson of the Head of the Borsod Police Department.
Those who have been suspected have been made aware of and are currently charged with helping a criminal offence.
The two youths, according to information from MTI, are being prosecuted in freedom.
Helping a criminal offence is punishable by the withdrawal of liberty for up to five years.
Suspect of a double homicide in Odzo, 23-year-old local male, was taken into temporary custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of pre-planned multiple murders for paid reasons.
During the investigation, it became apparent that a 23-year-old man owed a 53-year-old greater amount.
The suspect didn't want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor into the last center of one establishment in Odód where he first killed a man and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to information from MTI, a young man was preparing himself for the crime, as evidenced by the fact that the murder was committed by a hidden weapon at the crime scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a hundred percent stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party, even though the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the range of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the state is the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech Economic Journal E15, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount offered so far by interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech letters, so far, Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange of Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have offered.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, last week, expressed that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not exclude that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by experts in the stock markets at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 % of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance’s investment bank with approximately 25%, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European Letters
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European lists recall 'September 11'.
For a global financial disaster, we can thank the American President, accuses the Roman La Repubblica. The President has not even been able to dissect his own side to support the early-raised bill of law aimed at correcting this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second September 11.
Also, part of the Madrid press sees a guilty man in Washington.
According to newspaper El Mundo, the world's economy has led to an end to the collapse of the political leadership there.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is constantly increasing, for which the whole world will eventually pay for it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool for dealing with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just as one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be forgotten, pointed out by the Geneva daily Tags-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a rescue circle to the returning cash institutes, and taxpayers can save them from the crash.
Of course, if other banks collapse as dice dominatrix, then there will be no more money, no more improvisation.
In the long term, Member States of the European Union need to move through their national egoism and unite control of fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion of existing monetary institutions were given, as did the Vienna Der Standard, which calls for concerns that, like Americans, they will have to go deep into the pocket and European taxpayers in order to deal with the crisis.
The European Union has not been seriously addressing the crisis, which, as the cunami, is rolling with the old continent.
"The rescuers" do not have to wave the hundreds of billions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they were to determine in a firm way in which case it is reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
The intelligent car mimics the flight of a man
What would perhaps be the best method of developing the technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not the imitation of obstacles found in the world of nature?
A bee, for example.
The default strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the Japanese fair CEATEC, was inspired by engineers from Nissan czmelans. It was about how to build a new generation of systems that prevent collisions.
In cooperation with Tokyo University, Nissan has designed a bio-mimetic robot management system BR23C, a robotized miniiauto equipped with bees characteristics, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate all precipitations.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety packaging," explained Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General of the Trademark for Technology and Research and Development.
The complex eyes play an important role that allows bees to see more than 300 degrees in all directions of view.
The engineers were able to copy the function of the complex eye after the idea of a laser distanceometer.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters ahead of BR23C in the field of vision 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation aimed at preventing precipitation.
The transmission is captured during a fraction of a second, then the robotized car starts to imitating the movement of the bees and turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the precipitation immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If it wasn't for that, a robot car could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and project of a robotic car.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology meets the most vulnerable and internal layer of safety cover, within which the impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not last longer than the blink of the eye.
But unlike bees, this movement can not go up, down, or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in a direction that can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotational movement, acceleration and slowdown was applied in the case of a robot car.
BR23C uses lithium polymer accumulators that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, instinctive, intelligent reactions, not the ability to process, but the less storage of data are important.
This mechanism must only process and respond to several incoming signals per second.
There is no need for it to preserve and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, therefore it constantly uses only a memory of a few kilobytes size.
He doesn't need memory of giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing technology for immediate avoidance, which, according to Nissan's estimates, could reach serially produced cars within ten years.
Another possibility of use may be to link the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding in the way of obstacles lying, would lead the motorist to the target set.
Damn dear child has a name.
A $700 billion economic recovery package, which is to be divided into several instalments and is intended to buy out poor bank loans, is already in writing.
Half the amount will be used in the first round.
Following further negotiations, which ended on Saturday after midnight of the American Eastern Time, Congress officials reached an agreement in a few days on the ongoing debate on the rescue package of a total value of $700 billion, Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of Representatives, according to which only the conclusion of the agreement remains.
Both Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain supported the compromise on the package.
The Minister for Finance Henry Paulson stated that the compromise would result: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further steps need to be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. in the Washington time (so on Monday at 2 p.m. in the morning of the Central European Time), but no special rise on the stock exchanges caused.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the proposal for a legal standard, which hears the Act on Emergency Economic Stabilisation of 2008, the programme is to be set up.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then they welcomed the deal in the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress made at night and we very much appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," said the White House spokesperson Tony Fratto.
In fact, the program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal, in which it was intended to make a total of $700 billion in the purchase of quality securities secured by mortgages.
It is now possible to spend up to half of 700 billion in the first half of the amount, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the matter is expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will buy securities secured by mortgages that are rated as poor, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special congregation, the chairman of which will also be a member of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: at the same time, it can buy out poor loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, and other "dive" loans.
Purchase may take place both directly and directly within the auction, provided by competent representatives of the Ministry.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee of funds representing a reason for concern, for which the company will pay the price corresponding to the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the American financial system for up to $700 billion, whether it is an extensive purchase of the wrong funds, of their insurance or of preventing a systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the large financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, the bosses of banks that have been in trouble and are waiting for State aid can count on the government to reduce their redundancy, which is simply called the "gold parachute" in the overseas slang.
The limitation of their payments will take place only in certain cases and in addition, these restrictions will depend on the way in which assistance provided by the Ministry is provided.
In essence, the restriction means that if the Ministry buys in the auction, a tax premium will be imposed on the golden parachutes if the fallen directors of the bank are not sent directly to retirement.
In the event of direct redemption of poor loans, the government will aggressively step forward in order to ensure that the money for the management is not excessive.
It is necessary to add that the existing gold-dwelling agreements no longer change, the restriction only concerns new contracts, which should be a further incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history where there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of general directors," commented the Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State will set up a right in banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as once the economy and the rescued bank are on their feet, they can also make money on this transaction.
The draft plan contains that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal determining how the expected losses from the financial sector can be recovered to taxpayers.
Of course, there were also voices in the context of the doubt plan on both sides.
"This is not what the American citizens asked for, because dollars of taxpayers will not protect us," said the Republican Congressman of California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague in Ohio, Mary Kaptura, believes that the adoption of the provisions was precisely what was required by those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

In other processing industries, we measured price increases in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water sectors, which have a large weight in domestic sales, prices increased by 0,3 percent in August, mainly due to an officially determined increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic sales in the various processing industries, prices increased most in the professional oil processing industry (32.4 percent).
In the co-operating sector it was possible to see a 13.2% increase in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight, then a 11% increase in prices.
Price reduction took place in textiles and textiles sectors (2.5 percent) and in the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.3 percent).
In other processing industries the price growth rate was between 0,6 and 9,1 percent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 percent over the last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water sectors exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.

In the consumer sector, prices increased by 0,3 per cent, in the energy processing and further processing sectors, prices changed due to the previous month.
The biggest price increase, given the same month of the previous year, was observed in August 2008 in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, we have measured a price increase of 6.8 per cent, but in the case of tangible assets a price decrease of 1.4 per cent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forintech increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, down 3.9 per cent in the 12-month comparison.

Next year, without a visa to the United States?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is great hope that an American-Hungary visa-free agreement will enter into force around 12 January, the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "now it matters almost everything only if an electronic system of road and control is built around the sea in time".
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system would not be allowed to enter, but tourists would have to register before they left.
As of today, the representative of the Hungarian diplomacy has continued negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Minister of Foreign Affairs Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross with the Star of the Order for merits of the Republic of Hungary and will hold interviews with advisers for foreign policy of the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both US parties, agreed on Sunday to secure their support for the government bank rescue package of $700 billion, but there are also politicians who demand the demise of the Minister of Finance.
After a few days of hearing of Congress and the representatives of the administration, an early announcement was made on Sunday morning: the basic agreement on the bank rescue package was concluded.
The financial package, designed to recover the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain agree to be more appropriate among the two candidates to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, with the entry into the forefront of the economic issue, Obama again gained a certain advantage and McCain's head start, which, after the republican convention, secured Sarah Palin's nomination as vice president.
Obama expressed the hope at the Detroit election meeting on Sunday, that the 700 billion bill would be adopted quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passages concerning consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly... to your places, your savings, the entire industry, the stability of the whole economy is at risk," he said before the 35 thousand crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain an old-fashioned idea of economics.
McCain expounded in an interview with ABC's television station: "It's all going to be a little crippling... but nothing's just going to happen."
As the Republican Senator said, the proposal sets out the establishment of a committee overseeing the Minister of Finance and the limitation for the senior representatives on which he insisted.
Obama for the CBS station stated that McCain did not have a more significant role in the negotiations, on the contrary, he himself had been with the Minister in everyday contact.
The President of the House, Nancy Pelosi, announced on Sunday that the House of Representatives, may vote on the bill on Monday.
Overview of the German language printing area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it became more confident - so it analyses the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses in his article "The Bavarian Revolution devours its fathers" the cause of the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, CSU's erosion began a long time before its office took over the sad duo Beckstein-Huber.
Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of season is a problem for the entire Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel.
The debate was not entirely surprising for CSU, but on Saturday it ended a process that could be expected for almost ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s under the 50s.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, i.e. in the period so often referred to as Stoiber.
The reason for this is the modernisation that CSU has consistently carried out in this country and which consumes its parents.
The sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been very mistaken at the pace. The secularization, educational results, the settlement of the Germans from the east and the north in the emerging regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without consequences on the loyalty of the voters of the CSU.
Modernization is linked to the growth of opportunities, which also has visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it became more confident, more critical, more seductive.
It is also clear that in recent weeks CSU has been the most remote of the classic civil strata; people in a free profession, tradesmen, seniors and higher education.
By that, the CSU's support has already shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Vienna daily deals with the confused internal political situation created by the Austrian elections in its article "Who With Who?
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
ÖVP promises to involve SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ seems open to all negotiations, the greens still do not want to negotiate on the coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in a debate held on public television, the chairmans of the parties did not have much to look at their cards.
The President of the SPÖ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wished to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both sides is certainly possible - in some federal countries and in a social partnership.
The question of whether he can imagine the coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of ÖVP, as vice chancellor, left Faymann open.
As stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course has been re-elected for every fall.
Repeating this direction is not an option.
Molterer responded carefully to red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of ÖVP.
Whether the party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition, so far it is completely open, these questions must be discussed definitely within the ÖVP.
The President of BZÖ Jörg Haider once again appeared open to all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume our government responsibility," Haider said.
Jaróková: It is necessary to break the enchanted circle of poverty and Segregation
In Paris today, the European summit of equality, hosted by France, the current President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, a Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of professional bargaining in her message addressed to the plenary, has turned attention to the segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their application.
The summit opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - Mr Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Mr Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The negotiations were held among invited government representatives, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the MEPs' group, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that takes place in the recruitment of workers, the Roma are being pushed out of the European labour market primarily by the fault of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and, as a result of poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher level of education."
In addition, Jaróková stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Romani children may strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to strengthen the awareness of these links in the widest circles - both Romani and non-Romane children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the more likely he will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise duties, he will contribute to the national budget.
"The European Union's right of nationality is the need to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the removal of their not-too-quality and separate education," pointed out Lívia Járóková.
According to the Member, cohesion of the European Union is needed with an emphasis on the objective and action to speed up the processes of school desegregation immediately, and this is of the utmost importance to ensure that both existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations are complied with.
"There is a need to break the vicious circle of poverty, Segregation and Unemployment; it is necessary to give Roma children the opportunity of a democratic space in order to participate as full-time citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková requested.
Everyone in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" guarantees the objective of the European summit of equality, held every year since the Berlin meeting last year, ensuring a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and to eliminate discrimination set out at the level of all Europe and individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary Grace
The fate of the deserving dua Huber-Beckstein will be decided by the end of October
Despite the shameful electoral debate so far, the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the top of the Bavarian CSU.
The President of the party Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their seats, the question is when will this grace last?
The fate of tandem, who suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes, will be decided by an extraordinary congress party on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of a very criticised duea were told that they would not hold their posts.
So they tried to calm down the angry members of the faction and the base, who, due to the loss of absolute majority, required the day after the "Bavor Cunami" to produce personal consequences.
Five years ago - the truth, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, standing at the top of her career - won a Christian-social union of 60.7 percent, now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent of her strength.
In Bavaria, CSU has been a "self-owner" of 18 percent of German GDP for 46 years.
Although conservatives in the southern federal country, which has a key importance for Hungarian economies, are still in a high position, they will in any case be forced to coalition in the future.
One of the first features of the reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of a close intelligence team who will launch probes on possible coalition of Munich government with liberal FDP, and with a right-oriented group of Free Voivodes, will also be Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
It is an irony of fate that Gabriele Pauli, whose appearance against Stoiber, used the duo Huber-Beckstein to execute the puck, then, with an ambitious communal policy, made an unmerciful short trial.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, the active role will also begin with Stoiber, who so far worked the strings out of the background, the former prime minister of the country and former president of the CSU called September 28 the most persistent day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made a few nagging notes to the address of the CDU, according to him they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
CSU's other politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag of September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played an important role in national success in 2005, somehow by common forces, is on its feet.
According to Merkel, who, because of the fiasco, has been difficult to hide his disappointment, will have no negative impact on the Berlin Grand Coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the injured CSU will not be easier and the social democrat crisis continues.
The SPD has reached 18.6 percent of the weakest result since 1946.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, not one opposition Member made it to the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the prosperity and stability of Alexander Lukashenko in the country, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE), by the illegalities that occurred in the censusing of votes.
The assembly, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election.
Although the 110-member legislative body of the 10 million countries lacked the opposition for ten years, the opposition, united under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before last night's elections, seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had left himself, on the basis of a change in the constitution in the elections with the debated course in 2006, for the fourth time, to renew its presidential mandate, this time "let" appear in Parliament several opposition Members.
So ODS dropped from a previously considered boycott.
In the background of the opposition expectations, it was that economically increasingly dependent Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of the constantly increasing Russian imports of natural gas, took credit and contributed to Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines passing through the country, was in Russian hands - wishing to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment evaluated as an anti-democratic Lukasenko and other high-level politicians, they were not allowed to enter.
The release earlier pointed out that in the evaluation of the election campaign, the deal put emphasis on positive shifts and not on shortcomings - for example, the ban on candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OBSE's Monday flash report had already had reservations to the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not essentially appear in the press, especially to the fact that the opposition could not be present with the census.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners were released and Minsk was willing to go with Moscow and to a smaller confrontation, while he continued to refuse to recognize Georgia as independent of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which the state of Belarus is formed on the union paper, has been considered independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remain, even though "she has been too afraid to enter the meaningless parliament of a single member of the opposition".
In view of the results of the opposition, it does not plan protests, rather try to deliver its message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with this, of course, and the opposition leaves must be printed in Russia, distribution is putting obstacles to the local authorities, but I see that change is supporting more and more people, even among the elderly," said Milinkevich, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers its greatest success to create social security, does not consider the right or officially supported layer of pensioners.
"The indebtedness of the country and the growth of the trade deficit is only a matter of time when the social security 'inducing the silence of the cemetery' collapses," Milinkevich says.
Unlike the opposition policy, the Russian election observers considered it democratic.
The Head of the Community Mission of Independent States, Sergei Lebeděv, the Russian intelligence agency Rio Novosti, said that "people do not believe words but acts", so that the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It's the first time in the history of Chigi Palace, which were introduced by a rotating door upon arrival and departure of employees.
But as of today, this new measure will start to work against the man-made people, against those who have injected themselves, and then go to coffee at work.
The news against the sloths was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidential Council, Maurem Masi.
"The rotating door - says Brunetta – is an instrument for better work, higher performance, more gifts and more services" states the Minister.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency will open.
It is a reformism", stressed Brunetta.
We will complete the introduction of Chigi Palace in all the Council Presidency buildings.
For Masi, "the choice of turning doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections from the staff, the Secretary-General assures: 'This was a joint procedure with all the workers and cooperation'.
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "there's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning."

in Rome, the Minister will finally announce that the absence of public health workers has decreased by 50% within three months, i.e. 60,000 more people per year at work."
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"its wage dynamism – explains the Minister – has doubled over the last 8-10 years in terms of the private sector and is much higher than inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of public staff met to reject Brunett's decree in line with the applications supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Administration presents figures on lower absences in work due to illness," writes consumer protection associations – the nation of 'quietly lazy' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered to declare war against the illegal standards contained in the decree."
Tara will protest primarily against the exclusion of sickness allowances, which depends on activities; the extension of the time in which the sick can be checked within which time limits control visits will be carried out and against the other standards included in the new Ministerial Provisions.
Job injuries, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day, Italy becomes 2,500 accidents at work, three people will die and 27 will remain permanently disabled.
The values of Inail confirm that we have approximately 1.200 deaths in 2007 due to accidents at work.
These values show the severity of an incident that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double the death compared to murders.
In order to reinvigorate the attention of institutions, social and information resources regarding this dramatic problem, Anmil celebrates today in all Italian regions 58th national day of the victim of accidents at work as set out on 2nd Sunday in October.
"The worrying data extended by Anmil and the same tragic reports these days confirm how important the question of job security is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in the report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Frozens and Invalids for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its lifelong admiration for continuous joint efforts to protect jobs, to protect injured workers, to help families of victims and to participate in public opinion."
"Indigenous 'enough' has been naturally raised, honestly shared in the face of tragedy, which, by its extent, are causing excitement in the media and public opinion, but daily reality offers us again dramatic cases, even recurring in its dynamics."
Napolitan does not hide that "there is no doubt a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives put in place in the field of education are of particular importance in order for young people who face the world of work to gain a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up due to its worrying social severity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber, for his part, stressed "how is death caused by a work accident creating an absolutely critical social state, as he insults the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to end this condition."
"As regards the dates of accidents at work, it seems to show a positive turnout, but it does not deny that the number of deaths caused by an accident at work is either alarming", said President of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli again.
"We would not want this "reduction attempt" to lead to less attention, because the moment the attention stops, the tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that in general, too little is still being done to stop the injury problem and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion, to emphasise Mercandelli - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, right from school age".
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and participation in public opinion.
But there is a need for greater sense of responsibility by employers towards the phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social phenomenon. "
In the end, Mercandelli stated that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of the right to compensation envisaged for the work victims and the "response of supportive care" to which the system has been receiving in recent years."
"The goal is to return the employee's insurance - he added - because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneousity or giving time from time to time by the legislator".
MP3 players charged, put the hearing at risk
Listen to loud music for a long time and use portable music as a MP3 player can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to today's publication of the European Commission, which, in one official report extended in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks, which have recently emerged and have been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific opinion, we read in the notes, that 5-10% of those who, for at least five years, listen to music using portable musical instruments, per week more than an hour a day and keep the apparatus high volume, risk permanent loss of hearing skills".
"I am concerned that so many young people who use frequently portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high sound levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way" admits Meglen Kuneva.
"From scientific findings – the leading continues – there is a clear risk and there is a need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to review the existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to make them fully effective and to keep up with the new technology."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"The experts – closed by Executive Officer Eu – confirm that there is a need to worry and now the European Commission will examine with other members and parties what measures could eventually be taken to protect children and young people from exposure to noise, the originator of which are portable musical instruments and similar devices".
At present, there is already a European standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are increasing concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to significantly reduce these damage by looking for solutions such as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, will exceed the limits currently in force corresponding to the maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for a long time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should apply to 5-10% of users of such devices and can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will let the Commission run free for the future of the capital
We start today, we close in March, we get the sum in June.
This is the calendar given to Campidogli by the staff of the "Commission for the Future of the City of Rome", which met this morning in its new headquarters behind the Caracall Spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and other 49 members of the commission will draw up a manual for Rome.
When the door is closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analysis and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidogli and his councilman Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas – it wants to emphasise Alemanno – it will have to ensure proposals for Rome's development, which will eventually apply political judges, which remain Giunta e General Council.
It's not about any exchange of functions, it's just about trying to have some place to process a big project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then dissolved, because this institution must have an exact time limit.
In June – she announces the mayor – we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome's capital."
To the person who accuses the Commission of its futility, given that its opinion will not be binding, Alemanna will answer: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are of quality, as well as the Commission's Attali proposals, and so am I sure in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics breaks down on everyday problems and on the urgency that occurs from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, Mayor Rome wishes to stress that "the Commission is neither a unnecessary business nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, the Roman citizens will not stand nor the euro and will serve to think and involve the best intelligence the capital city has."
For Alemann, basically, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definitive nor motionless, in order to allow our city an authentic rise at the level that it needs, and to think of a united spirit in its future."
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not only limit itself to the current municipal border, but will look much further" not only in the picture of the future metropolitan city and its legal status, the capital city, but "also includes the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A famous American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who deciphered the U.S. economy with his decisions and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
The attacks against Obama are rising just as the election date is approaching.
One of Miami's ladies wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambitions.
But Obama has an insolence: he thinks he's going to get to the highest post of a nation who's always had two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they are attacks of unequivocally racial origin and do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then we have surveys; everyone says Obama will win and have a great lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not by the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, from the South of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the electoral cabinet, we know who the American patriot will give his vote.
One page of American mentality, which remained firm until the last moment.
Say what you want, eventually we'll take care of it ourselves, who to check for Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, almost a certain success of a black candidate.
However, despite all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1500 people: What mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent him home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were saved and Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become an Iraq for most of Bush's weakness.
Whoever comes to Georgie W's place will have to perform a huge task.
The US's economic collapse was felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in newspapers, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" press.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Now, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questionnaires did not explicitly say that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem is the money for American journalists, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, cuts made in newsroom, in a room where editors work to put together newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional Journalism to change substantially, as it is understood by the general public.
An American journalist goes through clear but complex pessimism.
Six of the ten journalists of the press and the executive seniors are convinced that the newspaper is being published in a bad way on a national scale.
In the local area, the power group is 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
Greater publishers take their way to the Internet, which many see as "killer" prints.
"Economic pressure", which journalists point out, has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred questioned journalists have admitted that they are resorting to technology in the hope of doing something good for their newspaper.
The biggest gap in American journalistism is among those who manage newsrooms – that is, leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values while their value is down to 23% at local level.
This has something to do with "assurance of work".
Leaders who think they're going to lose their job in three years is 47% at national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, they're moving to 30%.
As for "certain work" regarding staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In a nation such as Usa, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, tv and internet employers often offer what they want and so it is a question to take or leave.
The leaders receive almost always huge salaries and the editor can make even ten thousand dollars a month outside of paying pensions and insurance.
As far as the permitted ones are concerned, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick during one year.
It's just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: Court of Justice in Rome, Danilo COPPOLA Stays in GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinauda, decided to reject the submission of a real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the counter-delivery on the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he received last week's release from his home prison, which was converted into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real estate entrepreneur be able to change his place of residence from a rural town to a capital city.
However, according to the court, this transfer (with whom the pm expressed) would allow him to influence his company and to get to the evidence they blame him for it.
The elites in danger
This phenomenon was manifested a few days ago when the Representant Chamber voted against the rescue plan of $700 billion presented to the White House: a large number of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which inform us that the current crisis will tear the Republican Party apart, constantly more divided among its old East Coast soul, a milder one, in line with federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, is conservative, hostile to 'the Washington people' and towards the world of finance, strong especially in the countries in the middle part and south.
A soul that was arrogant by the vote I spoke of at the very beginning.
This very thing, however, is just an example of the changes, the major changes that the current economic earthquake has already shown: not only in the United States, but in the whole of the west and perhaps not just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, this crisis seems to work as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubated for a long time in the new climate and are finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the refurbishment, the exceptional recovery of the market, the dual category of State-power in relation to a certain renationalisation of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a banking financial institution which, of course, has strong bonds abroad, but in which, above all, the budgets of people and families living in a single country are largely included.
Which at the same time created a political problem for those who control it: that is, how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families, who are among others voters.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be significantly out of play or that it has nothing to add: obvious proof has given the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different national strategies and which cannot be decided for one common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and the distribution of funds: the moment we get into distress, only the countries have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put everything right.
He also owns the necessary means and permissions to use them: two sources of enormous value, under certain circumstances, that no market and no international organisation will ever be able to have to a similar extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis imposes on the state-national element, is, in fact, in complete harmony with the ever greater importance that the last economic progress is attempting to attach to one of its closely connected factors: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the Kingdom of the Site, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finances had already been destined to rule the world, we did not realize that our future would, on the contrary, have to deal more and more with such little non-material things as water, grain, oil.
All things that would say so can move from one place to the other, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to the bordered area, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler has a lot more cards in his hand than who is not and who has the bad luck of living in a place without grain, with no oil and no water.
I'm getting to the second news, which, however, predicts a break.
Who speaks of territory, state, government, inevitably talks about politics, that is, leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, it seems that two convergent phenomena are created.
On the one hand, the awareness that an objectively needed authoritative leadership is required, a request for someone who can handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredition towards existing leadership, especially economic leadership, which has proved to be equally inconvenient and full of dark places.
And together something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: discreditation, impatience, inability and absence, which is trying to control the entire ruling class in increasingly more and more Western countries.
It seems to be growing in the broad masses of the population by believing that their actions are as popular as the ideas of yet popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, like their culture in the true sense of the word, that elite has already exceeded its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply feeds on one branch from the underground, but a strong movement for the removal of ruling classes and traditional political order is manifested in the unexpected electoral "defences" or unexpected changes in collective moods in the last and most recent time, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of the Labourists in the UK, to the rebellion of American Congressmen against Bush (and perhaps also to the victory of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, as well as their ceremony, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have increasing problems to understand, i.e. to represent, which, not from today on, is created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is again strengthening, growing, potentially overclouding.
Before that, it would be excessive to talk about a permanent mass rebellion».
But I'm sure we can't say it means keeping our eyes open properly.
Super glue to walk on the walls
Overcoming laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various U.S. research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to maintain a hundreds of grams of body glued to the vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 cm square.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is the development of existing materials that use a specific carbon structure called carbon midget tubes.
«The base of adhesives can be imagined as a series of pipes placed as an organized pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists inspired the feet of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs, which allow the animal to ensure a perfect grip.
The tests performed on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time"s simply peel off the wall» explains Liming Dai, the researcher of the Faculty of Engineering of Dayton University.
AWARD? - "This material could be useful as a temporary glue" will deliver Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk around the walls as Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers think of far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices because midget carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
So far, no super heroes.
OTHER RESEARCH – Also the University of Berkley, California, is involved in research on new adhesives.
In one article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scientists presented adhesive formed from microfiber as hair, which themselves cleans itself from dust to the surface to keep the perfect adhering.
Medicines: Never with juices
Watch out for grep, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly during the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their intake changes in intensity or decreases in effectiveness with serious health consequences.
In order for David Bailey, professor of the Western Ontario University in London to highlight the risks of juices both finished and fresh in combination with some medications, the ongoing 263th National Meeting the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia causes a new alarm: one glass of grep, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, to cancel their beneficial effects and to expose patients to risk.
Grape juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs to a toxic level.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS IN RIZIKU – The Italian Medical Agency announced it itself in an information bulletin two years ago and extorted doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink when they take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NJEN GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contains substances that suppress drugs.
Long list of effects that are dampened by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the challenge of Michel Carruba, Director of the Pharmacological Department of the State University in Milan: " Such discoveries are mostly immediately notified to various international and national pharmacies agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions on drugs.
So always read the illustrative tickets of the medicines you get and if you find anything unclear, don’t get anxious, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» stressed an expert for the agency Ansa.
Nobel to economics by Paul Krugman
Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenian who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics regarding the foreign, economic and political steps of the Bush administration.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, on the days of Enron's failure, Krugman foretold in one commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would, in the sense of the consequences of the history of the United States, be much more important than the first.
A prediction that caused little polemics and which for years was calculated, but which proved to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked at the rate of collapse such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public interest, said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a 'economic of great importance', but also a populariser with a very aggressive style, especially critical of Bush's excessive liberalist administration».
Open Office, we have here the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of issue of Open Office.org 3.0, a package open source of personal production that is directed to penetrate increasingly more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the known Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of volunteers, controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with various new features: additional, far more substantial, compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO version.
The emphasis is also placed on working with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open a document and a new Microsoft file (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as allowing to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility to transfer the PDF folder to the graphic design model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create documents "PDF hybrids", which are similar to the typical Adobe graphics format and have the properties of a table processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has gained many improvements within application programs: in excellence it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes; in the text program, one color for comments is allocated to each co-worker to make it clearer in the revision phase.
Some companies also work on the transfer of some of the Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks they should reinstate the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded to http://it.openOffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, which has been added to the English version of the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the package is also available for the operating Linux system.
The installation cd may also be sent home or to the workplace at the request.
And if the theme of freeness can be a pull to expand in households, it is on the business area of Open Office that a lot bet, and it can already count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there is also a lack of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that is intended to replace Excel; Impress for presentation similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, eventually, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that by today we are almost 3 million and 600 000, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this anticipated number can be overcome.
Also Kohl's results are positive, it's the fourth doping case.
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: it is Rakusan Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and winner of the top leader T-shirt.
The message was quoted by the pages of the journal L'Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is a fourth-year-old player positive for Cer, Epo third generation, after Italy's Riccard Riccò and Leonard Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those carried out by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabra in recent weeks.
If control analyses confirm the positivity of Ceru, Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face established two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl's positivity to the third generation of Epo confirms that the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press, has already informed the Austrian government of the outcome.
The 26-year-old Rakušan was placed on the stage winners behind the Spanish Carlos Sastr and the American Cadel Evansem, and also won the pointy T-shirt of the best commander.
IMIGRANTI:NEW YORK TIMES ALWAYS IS ITALIE RASISTou?
Italy "as a country of emigrants only in the last house has converted into the priority objective of immigrants" adopted with resistance.
It turns a beautiful country into a racist nation, so it asks in one long article in the New York Times that devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and it began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed in Milan last month because he stole a box of cookies.
This case illustrates what the New York Times define by "the paradox of the North": the northern areas are also the ones where more integration and more work are registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation required by the Legou, which seeks to halt immigration and facilitate the extermination of illegal immigrants, is quoted as an example of changing climate in Italy.
The tendency highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedette XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together on the defeat of racism".
Students with expensive rent - up to €900 per room
The university student lease market does not know the crisis.
According to recent research by Sunia, the tenants' unions, the single room can be rented by a student in Milan to EUR 900, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"It has already reached such proportions that the entire class of students has lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to endure – explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani – in this city, the large demand from students has deformed the market in such a way that it stimulated the process of price increases which has also grown to residents".
In most cases, the offer of rents contains several offences: contracts free of charge, unregistered, without limited rental, associated rental.
Exceptional intervention is needed for Sunji, which could, through the revision of taxes, regulate prices.
If we look at the details of research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, there is about 450 Euro for one bed, the room is paid from the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) over an average value of 800 (the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) up to a maximum of 900 (in Vitoria zone).
In Florence there is one bed on average 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the university, it takes 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) want approximately 600 euros for single room, 450 bedding in double bed.
The values are slightly lower (€550 per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
We save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, for example, 300/450 Euros are required, for a room from 400 to 600 Euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want EUR 250/350 per bed, at least 350 per single room.
In smaller cities prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most frequent phenomenon is rent for students from countries outside the European Union, there is finally one further anomaly: an increase of approximately 25% to 30%, which they want for foreign students, compared to Italian.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel historic halls
The cinematographic historical halls are closing in favour of Multiplex.
"The place without cinemas is as blind as a face without eyes."
The painting offered by director Giusepp Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centers as well as rural towns.
The process of reducing cinemas, the birth of great multi-sales in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of monosalas in the central areas of cities is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the features of true cultural crime.
The historical places are often lost by memories,"it is as if we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of the journey and a lot of emotions», felt the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won Tornator Oscar 20 years ago and a great award of the jury in Cannes, and who told the poetry of one village cinema and sadness about the way of life that probably the cinema lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, are clear: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of traditional tip, and the highest account has paid mainly the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures is Emilia-Romagna with the loss of 82 cinema halls followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first one responsible for their disappearance is the introduction of multiplex is these three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multisals: 195 squares more in the Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian procedure has evolved unravelly” claims Paolo Protti, President of Anecu,” is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that they will survive already existing ones, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of his visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about insufficient funding to the fund for operators: the previous government debt is approximately EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed».
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closures and which decided to find the way out by signing a protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of these types in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historical centres and suburbs.
Among the planned standards are tax relief steps for operators and the benefits for audiences in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter a restricted transport zone and will have special prices to stop and at some parks.
«This initiative I like» says Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that the other cities will follow the example of Bologna through other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to be able to resist the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was a spark that convinced me to start a "New Cinema Paradise", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk before Rialt or Quirinal in Nazionale Street, where I shared so much emotion that I don't have to look at the inscriptions blackened by dust, I turn to the other side».
The connection between politics and the mob group 'ndranghet, Mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the city office's election according to the interests of the Mob Piromalli Group."
The charges against the mafia Directorates in Calabria against the mayor and Vice Mayor Gioie Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosari Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarna Carla Martelli, who were imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the mob, are heavy.
In the irons also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, an attorney, a noun of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mob character, sentenced to reimbursement of EUR 10 million.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as common sense," writes the prosecutors when two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay a consult to Advocate Piromalli.
"This would enable the Mob group – the judges write – to officially enter the city offices and to facilitate already the enormous possibilities for control and management of public administration".
The President of the Calabrian Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised crime underworld are a lot in his region: "They are areas in which the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'andranghets, heroes who are still indiscriminate'.
Prisoners this morning follow after the incarceration of July last year, which the police have shown that the Pyromalli mob group has been given a final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was that the link between organised crime and local administration was also envisaged - local politicians were deprived of office in municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, President of the Christian Democrats, was elected head of the Coalition of the Right Center at the time of dissolution after a narrower election in May.
He screamed about the scandal when the Prefectura ordered the city council to disband.
He called for the responsibility of the Deputy Minister of Interior Marc Minniti at that time and accused him of plotting everything for political reasons, but the judges in the incarceration order signed this morning explain that the Mob has come even so far that it has requested a change in the A3 motorway project.
Other interviews directed against Dal Torrion, writes to the public prosecutors, came out "the willingness to move the claims of a businessman, a representative of a larger group very close, as is generally known, Piromallim and adapt the choice of public administration to the interests of the Mob."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones enter the game.
It's an infinite bearing that covers more than 70% of the earth's surface, and now it's being discovered by large global energy companies.
The waves, the currents, the tides, the tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the eyes of the colossians such as Chevron, who are now trying to reach out to these resources.
The possibility of creating energy from movements of the sea has been studied for over a hundred years and in the 1970s research has intensified in the context of the first oil crisis.
When oil prices dropped around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went aside, but now environmental organisations and a new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 declared that about 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of wave movements of the seas.
this quantity would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centres.
In addition, there are currents and tides and tides.
Giants attack.
the company which had placed on marine energy was Enersis, who agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology," said the spokesperson of one company that is connected to the United States' oil colossus, the Wall Street Journal's economic daily newspaper, and is thinking about working with us.
The cooperation we are considering concerns the acquisition of an authorisation from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of a project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially given that it is in Alaska that oil is still being mined and President Bush recently came up with a new drilling plan.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and so far invested amounts, even though they are not known in detail, show an increasing interest according to observers.
Technology, there's work to be done.
Experts are talking about technology, which is still in the beginning, because it is not known what effect marine energy will have on the environment.
For the time being, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not appear to cause major ecosystem problems.
For greater energy production, however, technologies with a greater impact on the water supply must be used.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the system of fear, which are connected to each other.
The force of waves that moves with the fights up and down is changed by using cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these fights.
The pressure is rolling the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
Energy reaches the shore of underwater cables.
For the time being, there are four facilities of this type at the project stage, which are only waiting for federal approvals and some of the energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for the shopping centre and parking using six marine turbines in the New York East River.
The movement of water during the tide and the drain causes the rotation of the turbines, which by this rotating movement feeds the generator.
Verdant stated that they had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisation to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tide, and after the tide.
A particular interest at this point deserves the potential of inflow and outflow, they say in the Institute for Energy Research.
Although this is an independent factor, the tide and the drain are more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves, and thus more reliable as the source of energy.
Just in the energy of the influx and outflow states like New York, Maine and Alaska, and with other coastal states, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and predicted investments of up to 35 million dollars in 2009.
