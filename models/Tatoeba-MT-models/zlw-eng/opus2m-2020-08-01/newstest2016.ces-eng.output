On an emergency call, the professor confessed he shot his girlfriend.
During the call to an emergency line with a shaking voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police that he shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come home.
Lamb decided that his "sweet dog" was a house alive and probably upset, and that contacts with the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and handwritten white office paper: "I'm so sorry, and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," said Lamb, according to the authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles on the campus, where the police think he shot his favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Chief of Police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university staff heard shooting at 10:18 in the morning.
Lamb said he made a fatal call to the emergency line shortly after.
In the end, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
Day after shooting at school, she forced students and the faculty to hide behind closed doors, and the entrusted authorities are still trying to find out what the Lamb's motivation was.
The details published by the investigators on the side of the state and the students and the employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented but probably a troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent history.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in thanking "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other members of the Faculty and many students attended courses at both sides.
At the same time, there were inclinations in terms of problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if something wasn't right with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave, saying he had a problem.
And this year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes to recruiting university staff meant that the doctorate Lamb worked hard on wouldn't give him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
The president of William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba apparently suffered something."
Lamb won't answer these questions again.
After he left campus, the police caught his lead when he crossed the border of the state of Arkansas back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with the only shot from a gun in the yard about a mile from his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of the state of Washington, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said that he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and training hours.
In spring he received his doctorate in education.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met with each other.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older guy who taught her guitar for several years.
He was a heartbreaker back then.
The heart of all the girls has gone down as soon as he appears," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss dated some time.
During the emergency call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was never a record of the wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely collapsed," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She was best friend with her mother.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Abigail and I were at a summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator in The Julepe Room, saves the lit bar near Gautier, said that the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, the sweat Lamb made on the guitar and the harmony for the countless crowd.
There was no sign of anything bad.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We used to paint and record each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminar in his first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, English professor at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boy student club and student government.
About 900 people, including members of the faculty, employees, students and members of the community, attended a reminder event with candles at Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also participated in the Christmas Eve, during which the university choir covered "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
School started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writings for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was modified to reflect the fact that the police are now claiming Lamb made a call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called his wife Prentiss, there is no evidence that they were actually disembarked.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us claims not to take as many seasonal workers as last year, but child toy manufacturers and products claim to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire around 40,000 employees for business and distribution centres throughout the country, which is a decline compared to the last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting candidates this month and will recruit employees during October until December.
While holidays in themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is coming up and companies are preparing to temporarily accept employees to assist in shops and sales, for sending and delivering goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'rande' with Princess Diana
The Prime Minister "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming document, "Back in time."
The film begins and I realize I'm within reach of something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in time," is a paper on "Return to the Future," which presents talks with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemecki and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back to the Future" premiere was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the best travel document ever filmed for me."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
The UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russian rapid military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of almost five years of conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
Once again, the UN Chief has urgently called on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and promote inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution.
Ban said at the Wednesday press conference that he was planning to meet foreign ministers with five permanent country councils - USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the Ministerial Meeting at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the division in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "has made this situation unresolvable."
Ban called on five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity they have shown in reaching Iran's nuclear agreement in the resolution of the crisis in Syria.
8 electoral numbers that show Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to refer to him as a man who often changes his mind.
The rest of them over your hands are like a failed joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But whatever some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they're not doing it yet.
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people are seriously asking what it means for the nomination chances of this real estate magnate.
Of course, there is only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win a Republican nomination.
Experts point out that during this time of 2011, the leadership of Rick Perry made a path towards the rise of Herman Cain, in the end not one of them won a single standing in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could hit the general elections.
But outside groups like the Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and begin to interpret their dollars on the stand in order to overthrow it.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that the real estate magnet is not just a mere phase:
Trump's favor assessment turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
By mid-July, that was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion on him.
And these numbers are held in the initial stages.
After the vote of Quinnipiac last week, it was found that 60 percent of the Republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said that they would be either "overjoyed" or "satisfaction" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "indigenous" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent said they would be "inflated" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters claim to be "unhappiness" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush were to become a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his incompetence and insult, 52 percent of the Republican voters are all-rounded to the idea that the real estate has the right temperament for the President's post, according to the ABC News/Washington Post vote on Monday.
The same number is held in the Senatorial Club of the State of Iowa, which is the first in the whole country where 52 percent of the Republicans think he has a commander's personality, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
However, 44 percent think he has no personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to this idea.
When they put on their learning hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question who most likely wins the GOP nomination, four of the 10 said that Trump would be the best choice, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's a late July change when four of the 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete publication: Voliczi GOP did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
By this time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the 28-percent candidacy nomination for Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trumpov aid is diphusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the Monmouth University survey from the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct fight between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always receive majority support.
Leads 13 points over Carly Fiorina, Marc Rubie by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally by Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points to everyone.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over a businessman with a wide range of 19 points in a hypothetical match one against one.
Most of Donald Trump's followers claim they've already made their point.
A new Tuesday CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of Trump support voters say they won't change their minds anymore.
Clearly, a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they keep an open back door to change between candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent to his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion definitive would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 of the 10 Republicans allegedly agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in the announcement of his campaign of immigration still held as the main and central topic of the conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump's incitement will draw the key Hispanic voters away from the Republican party and the damage they seek to rebranding.
But according to the new ABC/Post public poll on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the subject of immigration remains in the light of the reflectors, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration from the government is reaching a new maximum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive approximately half of the support from the Republican voters, especially given their condition outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post vote say they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The vote by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were "unrested" and 21 percent "ferently angry."
The House supported a greater share of the state's coal charges.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the amendment of the Upper Law, which regulates the return of charges on brown coal surface mining from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that this would give them extra money, both the Treasury and the municipal budgets.
Members of the opposition, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the village as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in the first reading supported the government amendment of the Upper Law, which, among other things, means that the State should receive a greater share of the yields of the brown coal surface mining charges from the mining companies.
The share of the State will be increased to 67 percent, while the share of the municipalities will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent so far.
The forecast also changes the way in which the remuneration for minerals will be calculated.
The change in mineral mining charges is expected to bring CZK 427 million to the Treasury more than in 2013.
The revenue of the municipalities' budgets is expected to have a neutral impact according to the Government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal was around CZK 200 million and the state of CZK 66 million.
The amendment also calculates an increase in the remuneration from the living space with the allowed mining to CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments shall continue to belong fully to the municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that the municipalities would receive CZK 14 million to 100 million a year.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but the government will establish it by regulation.
The remuneration shall be calculated as the sum of the amount of the extracted mineral and the rates for the individual species of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, Mr ODS Marek Benda warned that setting the fee by government might not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládek, in this case, it is not a tax, since the State charges a mineral that is a state property.
Fees shall be received only by municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the city's money and one quarter of the state's money will be received.
The same ratio will also be for the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state will collect on mining charges will be assigned purposefully.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage to mining or to provide for Baňského rescue service.
The draft was criticised by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that they would damage the municipalities affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they did so far because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Svět) elected in the Ústí Region.
Ms Hana Aulická warned Mrs KSČM about the rise in unemployment in Mosteck.
Kadner and Aulická failed to propose the amendment to reject, Kučera wanted the law back to the government for completion.
The reasoning report states that according to mining companies, the increase in charges is not reflected in coal prices, as prices are of more than 90 percent long-term contracts.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or power plants should not feel price increases.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for their efforts to reduce their operating expenditure, which would in particular mean reducing the number of employees," the Government admits.
However, according to it, the increase in employment charges is bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment to Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial for Members to know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits before the approval of the law.
If coal is to benefit from limits, then it will have an impact on both the state and the municipality's incomes, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should not fall until 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of ČSA should be broken for social, economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Happy will lead Bohemia as one, deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear at the Davis Cup's bar drawn in India this Thursday, and this time each of them will probably hit the game as well.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans that due to difficult conditions, he will spread the load to the entire quartet.
There is a hot and high humidity in Delhi, which is why there are demanding matches that can stretch to five hundred.
We need to keep this in mind.
I'd like to spread it by the weather.
And according to what it will look like, he said Navrátil during today's Czech selection training in the centre of Raż Kumár Khanny.
With the team’s number one and world forty, Jiří Veselý counts both on Friday and Sunday’s two games.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are probably protologized to the position of the twin.
I'd like to see almost everyone involved.
It's a little slow in my head, but I'm not gonna say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be Štěpánek's participation in Saturday's four-game.
It's just a question of who's gonna stand next to the experienced deblist who's got 18:4 in Davis's four-game balance cup.
It's probably not going to be fun.
There's no choice with Rosol or Adam Pavłask.
"I really don't know who and what it's gonna look like," said Navrátil.
It shall decide according to the development of two games.
The difference may be Pavlásek, with the Happy Surprised in the 1st round of winning in the debut over Australia.
"He's decent to the devil," said Navrátil.
I've done well against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to do the same thing I've shown since the second set.
"I'm happy for this experience and I'd like to bring a point," said Pavlásek.
The house will put Yuki Bhambri in two games (125 in the ATP ranking), which won last week a challenger in Shanghai, where he defeated the third and fourth hundreds of rankings.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both challengers and ours have experience from the ATP Tour, but we've seen many times that the Davis rankings don't make decisions.
"He decides the current form, the weather," said Navrátil.
Friday's opening two games start at 6:30 SELČ and can stretch due to weather.
It's supposed to rain, and the court isn't under the roof.
However, it can be played if necessary for artificial lighting.
They've already lit it, and it's got, like, 2,000 luxuries, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," said Navrátil.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut in PMQ has been very eagerly expected
The new Chief of Staff, Jeremy Corbyn, will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and will first work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement he asked "less theatre and more facts."
He also said that he might skip several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual Congress of TUC.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labourist leader to stand quietly while singing the national anthem in service on Tuesday to the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the battle for Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative Members and is at the heart of several stories on the headlines of the newspaper.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention to himself.
Mr Corbyn's spokesperson said that he would "stay in respect of the silence of honor" and that he would recognize "the heroship of the royal air force in the battle for Britain."
However, a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two's Newsnight that the Labourist leader would recommend the national anthem to sing "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in the top of Mr Corbyn's team, quoted differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties initially supported him as a leader.
The BBC’s political correspondent Robin Brant says that the political differences in work also "become" after Mr Corbyn’s appointment through his position in the European Union and the government’s limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, secretary of the shadow work and pensions, said that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, facing David Cameron in the last decade since his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of a working party who has promised a different approach to politics claims to have ideas "from the crowd" on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confrontational and that they will abstain from both "fast-fired responses" and toothed trade and, instead, promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow trade secret, will represent him at PMQ if he does not participate — such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the thought that he would let other colleagues come to his place from time to time because he heard that he had discussed the whole matter with House spokesperson John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said that he wanted to turn himself away from the style of "Punch and Judy", which was often associated with PMQ, but several years later he admitted that he failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer for the judgement of leaders, their management of the House and its position between other MPs, although critics argued that they became caricatures and needed far-reaching reforms.
"Foce in Jobburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The Johannesburg Center is a hard place to be homeless.
But one group of former street kids found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was photographed in Jobsburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Libra rises while wage growth in the United Kingdom accelerates
Libra jumped the following data and showed the recovery of the British wage growth, while FTSE 100 was led by the SABBMiller tender target.
Between May and June, GB’s profits, including bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009, and it looked like estimates were coming up when the rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% compared to the dollar at $1.5505 and was 0.84% above the euro at €1.3730.
FTSE 100 index closed to 1.49% at 6.229.21.
SABBMiller was an exceptional market share and jumped by 20% after he got closer to his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine two of the largest brewerys in the world, and close-up brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the Rival luxury product group Richemont.
The latest sales results of Richemont are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have begun to rise again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5% after the mining giant said they increased by $2.2bn with shared placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The stock in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest fall in the index and dropped by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs reduced his credit rating to the company on "sale."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company announced an 83% jump in half of the year in pre-tax profits £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansion.
The Executive Chairman of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that higher minimum wage for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "better purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs of his company, he says.
Costs could intervene with plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
The opponents of Prague apartment marshmelon exult.
Controversial construction got a stop sign.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investmenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and to appeal against it.
One hundred people protested in front of the Prague Prague office, which is to be built in close proximity to the Anež monastery in the centre of Prague.
The Magistrate stated in the decision that the construction law had been infringed because all the elements of the territorial decision were not respected.
"The transversal territorial decisions do not contain, for example, the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clearly described shape of the building, the demarcation of the territory concerned by the effect of the construction," says the decision.
It also considers it illegal for the Magistrate to be that certain documents for the decision were issued for the original dossier which had changed.
This is, for example, about the views of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be created on the premises of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid approval.
It follows from the file that, however, the owner of the land demonstrated only the consent of the project documentation for territorial management, not the approval of the location of the building on his premises, writes the department of the construction order.
According to Francesco August Razett, the department of building order did not take note of the decision of the senior authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review has already expired.
Anyway, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, we have complied with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in the press release.
The project, which people allegedly call marshmelon because of the design of the façade, causes strong emotions in Prague.
In the city centre, hundreds of people met at protests against construction in the past.
The association and residents of nearby homes are concerned that some of the permits were issued for a house that should have looked different many years ago.
They also criticise the incompetence of buildings for the historical center of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Anež monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which counted with glass facade, rejected, on the basis of the opinion of the National Memorial Institute (NPO) of the Ministry of Culture and abolished the permission of Prague monuments in 2010.
A new project by Prague Progetti e Investmenti with windows in the shape of faces but also the NPÚ and the main monuments approved and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects opponents, said he never counted with the facade in pink color, which gave the project a nickname after pink and white sugar.

The police said that they were doing the right thing, but the bond of communication, because they didn't speak too well English.
However, according to him prison was tragic.
In our cell, for example, about three times four metres, there were 15 refugees in Syria.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people have been locked up there the next day, and none of them knew what was going to happen to them because of the language barrier, said Berg.
What can't be confiscated?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday, 18.9. he will answer questions from 9:30 to readers by the President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic Mgr. Pavela Fučíková.
You can ask her about changes to the law on enforcement applicable from 1 September 2015 as well as other things related to executions or executioners.
Metcash launches a rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the Aldi in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches a rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of over 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand using marketing in mainstream media and social events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are added brands such as Dunsborough based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tastings in IGA stores and store owners sell discounted tickets to the Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of his defence strategy on September 29, when a food, alcohol and hardware dealer celebrates his annual strategic investment day.
There is a lot at stake because South and Western Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA business steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Viktoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern States.
Anyway, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi is going to be five percent of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of the opening of the first sales that they took over from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail could lose USD 360 million in annual sales and Metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in Western during the next year, and will generate sales of USD 500 and 600 million on individual markets.
Loss of food sales and volumes in the fixed price base Metcash could cost him about USD 13 million in pre-tax income, confirmed by Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash lost its market share in the Eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although the last survey by Roy Morgan found that the buyers in IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Hamish Douglas Fund, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "presumably disappear in a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglas' comment.
But it is known that the board member of Metcash contacted Douglasse last week.
The market share of IGA has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and the earnings from Metcash’s food trade, which supplies around 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation, as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale has gone into counter-attacks and is investing more than USD 150 million a year to balance the counter prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping retail IGAs re-fit stores by adding fast-growing food and news from private customers.
Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morice, claims that the price comparison and business equipment programs will catch up with the fall and hope that the big sale will return to the basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a secondary loss in his recent fuss with his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented dua often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention thanks to the affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifier game in Cincinnati, they had to be Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice separated the referee, Harrison then declared: "Wawrinka had one pull to Kyrgios, and I should have pulled him up as well."
While he was last seen breaking the rocket after a cramp defiled Richard Gasquet's possible possession of the US Open, Kokkinakis was unwaveringly defending Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for the second two-game location behind Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I have been quite intensely thinking that, in my opinion, Thanas was a little involved in the dispute," says Healy.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost because of the cramp in the US, but he's not the first player to be angry about his frustration on his rocket, and I know Thanasi well enough, and I can say he's not gonna be proud of this event.
But he really was very well controlled because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a great deal of recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's a very grown-up 19-year-old man, works very hard and fits great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the dressing room, he's trained hard, he's in amazing condition, he's a very stable and advanced young boy, and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgiose due to an important game that starts on Friday, and states that "joint decisions" is the right solution for all, but supports a native from Canberry to return to the team as a long-term stability.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversy [Cyrges] that arose around it," says Healy.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the public's eyes, he's also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the picture, when he can think about it, is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for him himself.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes its borders and detains migrants
Following the notification of the threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and arrested those who attempted an illegal crossing to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the land of no one, and Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.
Those who have been stuck for an unknown time on the lanes of the earth among the two states are the ones who run from violence in their home countries, build tents and settle down.
But there's a feeling of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants call together, "Open the border!" and broadcast the order unit of the Hungarian police.
Some say no to food and water.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was 'inadmissible' for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more of them come from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
During the next days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Disasters at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-state block did not come up with a uniform immigration policy to continue meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people looking for protection in surprised Italy and Greece, hoping to reach an agreement for the next month or the end of the year that more than 120,000 refugees, including Hungary, would adopt.
German federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special EU summit to discuss the continental refugee crisis on Tuesday.
However, Hungary did not turn its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the threat situation in two southern regions gave the authorities more power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up the cases of asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees who are trying to cross their country when the fence is now completed at the Serbian border.
CBS News Korean Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point for refugees in the European Union, many of which have fled Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not war refugees looking for protection, which is a view clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize the violation of a four-meter fence that the government has set up on the southern border with Serbia, and also establish longer periods in prison for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government has declared a threat," said the spokesperson of the Government of Zoltan Kovacs in the southern town of Szeged.
We are very clear in this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, Parliament must still approve of the deployment of the army that was expected next week, but reporters Associated Press at the border watched heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's Advisor for Home Defense, said that the authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 had already caught up in the state territory.
They have penetrated the fence damage and are now charged in police custody for crimes under the new laws.
The authorities quickly repaired the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a barbed wire-covered tow truck.
At the main border crossing at Roszke there was chaos because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and formed pressures of people.
About 20 fit in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's jump before Bernie Sanders dropped by half in the national vote
The former Foreign Secretary, Hillary Clinton, is still holding a two-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is leading her lead.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of democratic primary voters (lower 58 percent) while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he will want to become president, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters claim it is too early to say that there are clear decisions that the candidates will support.
But the Clinton sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost ground under her feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders won several.
Clinton's got a big lead between women, and she's getting down, but her leadership is getting narrower.
Her support between men has decreased significantly and Sanders has lost only 5 points on her.
The benefit of the Clintons with democratic voters under 50 has disappeared and is now equal to Sanders.
Clinton, however, still has great leadership thanks to the senior voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit lead in front of Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic primary voters in the entire states say that she would love to support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
The quarter would support it with reservations and another 15 percent would only support it for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
I guess it's no surprise that Clinton's current supporters are particularly inflamed about her.
The views are mixed among those not currently supported by Clinton - only about a quarter would love to support it.
While 48 percent of democratic primary voters say that they would love to support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked openly why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), it is time for her to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
There is also a great opportunity to select and agree on problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential candidate for the President, 57 percent of democratic primary voters would like him to face it - a third of them think he shouldn't run.
When the primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second election for the nomination of the party, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden's choice was their second choice, far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for a Democrat nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden will run, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance candidate for winning general elections; but this figure fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is far away second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely option is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of a candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over greater choice.
Like last month, neither one democratic candidate or potential candidate shall act as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some of the key characteristics among the primary voters of their parties.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trusted, that is, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have that opinion on him.
The primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
As far as all these standards are concerned, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions regarding Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and the server as state secrets continue, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter and say that their overall view of her did not affect it at all.
But between the American public, it's a whole different story.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfaction with her explanation, while only about a third of them are satisfied.
The public’s views on this topic were already divided in March, shortly after this problem came out.
Most Americans claim that this email counter-controversy has no influence on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent of them have worsened Clinton's view.
They are mainly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their view of Clinton has worsened.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and credible among the voters of her party, this issue is still a problem between registered voters overall: only 32 percent sees her as honest and credible, which is a fall of eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think it's honest and trusted.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters around the country do not see Trump as being honest and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump have good signs of leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were best placed in integrity.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson's, a lot of voters didn't think of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up behind Donald Trump in the national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey.
Two candidates are responsible for half the voters in the latest survey, and others are getting support.
The Republican voters continue to support Trump's overwhelming majority throughout the country, reaching 23% of the support in the last CBS survey before the Fox News debate last month, 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey has also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, and is dealing Trump among university-educated republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorino and the Governor of Ohio, John Kasich, is completely behind, together with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, with 10% of the support, fell to 2% current.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida are all in third place together with 6%.
The error rate in the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson improved and reached 19% support between the Republicans for Trump 32% of the aid.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In Carson's rising trend, Trump decided to fire a blind shot at a neurosurgeon in the field service, and Carson even apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five members of brotherhood accused of the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the overburdening brother ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and the late ones took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, reported the police.
The police say he had tied his eyes, had a backpack full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
In the end, Mr. Deng complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of Pi Delta Dogs didn't call 911 immediately after Deng passed out, and they reportedly waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, claims the police.
However, they found time to change Dengo's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, and ask him for advice, put Chief Chris Vagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their equipment and basically preferred the well-being of the brotherhood over Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly hit with blunt force trauma to the head, hull and thigh.
"A lot of families have been devastated because of overburdening in the brotherhoods, and at least one student dies every year because of overloading since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, lawyer representing Dengov's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be responsible and this step is important by the authorities.
The grand jury, Monroe County, recommended the murder charges of the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with assaulting overburdening and criminal association.
"We want to hold not only interested parties, but, if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will also drive them to responsibility," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned brotherhood and national brotherhood canceled its relationship with local branches.
This happens when the Fed raises interest rates
The growth of rates will come and the bull market will stumble, the return of bonds will rise and the economy will slip into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it takes.
For the economy in particular, it offers the history of a small timer.
The recession came 11 months after the first tariff increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in tariff increases is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when tariff increases begin, but rather on the trajectories, how long normalization will take.
There are really more variables in the game.
However, in the end, members of the market can make sure that all the fusses due to an increase in speed can be exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as the end of the 'expensive money' era," said Julian Jessop, head of the global economist Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of American interest rates to more common, but still low, to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
That means there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded in the last about a month, the expected tariff increase can make the air a little unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for re-stopsing the shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the gap in monetary policy," the analysts said Deutsche Bank in a recent study on what will happen after the rise of the Fed.
More specifically, the market over the last 35 years often has the most - about 14 percent - is heading to raise rates in relatively flat in 250 days (mean increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis of Bob Doll, the main stock strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published at Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the shares tends to become more pronounced later in the tariff increase cycle and the return begins to decline.
The recession is a real economic life, but it is often helped by rising rates.
At present, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and which could speed up the recession.
The most remarkable thing is that gross domestic product near its lowest point in history when increasing Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, only twice the nominal annual GDP increase was below 4.5 percent during the 118 tariff increase since 1950.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few were expected to hold it, when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, states Atlanta Fed.
The increase in tariffs in this difficult economic background could be risky and the question might arise, "this time is different," Deutsche said.
The market participants were prepared for the Fed's growth all year long and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federation Free Market Committee this week and ended on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, future trade is only 25% likely.
"In our study since 1950, all the upswing cycles have been so far in a super cycle of lever effect increase with GDP covering the peaks of the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," says the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far as the longest one of the Feds had waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still continuing.
The fixed yield was also volatile as the market expects to increase its rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the shares experience.
The main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than for shares when the Fed changes the policy direction.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/reduction cycle.
At the end of the bond increase cycle, they fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that raising rates will cause incomes to approach between long- and short-term bonds to equalize the curve.
Debts with high yields often work better in this climate, although "we are still careful about tensioning income," said Kathy Jones, a firm analyst of fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that the markets are already adapted to the expectations of Fed's policy.
"Apart from the strengths of the dollar and the decline in inflationary expectations, there are several indications that the market has adapted to the prospects of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are upstairs, the yield curve is flat, the margin of credit has spread and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens up politics.
Generally speaking, companies that carry out most of their business in the US will win interest rates after the increase and local products become more attractive.
Transnational debt companies will be worse off, because the dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market, and their debt will also be greater.
"Historia shows that the "quality" of shares tends to overcome within three months after the initial increase in rates," says the analysts of Goldman Sachsve in the report for clients.
Firms with strong balances ahead of weak balance sheet companies in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital, as well as low volatility stocks, also overcame their counterparts of lower quality on average by 4 (interest points), respectively 3 (interest points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with high percentages of variable interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Consumers also benefit from a growing dollar outside of purely stock games.
The customers can see their profits also through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, claims to be Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "sniping"
He believes he's becoming increasingly unrecognizable from his commercial opponent.
He's also focused on BBC Music Awards, and he says they're just cheating on the British.
Member of Damien Collins attacked the Voice and he says neither is the original idea.
BBC Radio 3 "change" into Classic FM, claims a leading MP and collects fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove that they're doing something that commercial broadcasts don't do.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station seems to be "absorbed" and is increasingly unnoticed from its business opponent.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word "absorbed" - but it seems to change to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year seems to be the British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that I can think of, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the charges, stating that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business opponent in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live with music and making music is, in fact, at a top level.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and putting new works into service is also very important," she says.
At the beginning of this year, the BBC controller Radio 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got under fire due to the footing of commercial competitors during the broadcast of culture, the Media and Sport and got to the hearing commission.
The Conservative Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show bought by the BBC from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million prize.
Do you see why this program is discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Paloma Faith and Boy George are shining as judges - was produced by "a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the corporate community to "find a hit from its own stable" when the next time he started a fun series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending money on license fees on other formats of entertainment.
Internet sales have been growing at the slowest rate since August, and Black Friday may be on blame.
The first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth since 2000 began
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be a reason to stop spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping was on the rise and thanks to it became the cities of ghosts from many British major streets.
However, experts argue that there are signs of setting online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts argue that there are signs of setting online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth over the past years and go back to 2000, the situation has always been rationalized over time," says Andy Mulcahy, IMRG sales index editor.
It explains that online sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as the sofa.
But now (growing) is a bit stagnating, and therefore it seems to be responding.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was transferred from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could abstain from shopping before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
In the last year, five times more than the average of the buyers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and to drop several websites of dealers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which the buyers are renegotiating, can keep customers from buying more
The research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was killed online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
The Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the crane in Mecca and the family Bin Ladena was punished
The bodies of 29 dead were transferred through the streets of Muslims in the execution of the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames for the collapse of the construction magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall of the crane in the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, the mourners chose the way and gave up their respect for the victims when the first of the fallen came on his last journey to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message was passing past the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and turned to the believers.
The bodies were released for the funeral and the Saudi king punished the building group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of the crane at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the opening of the annual snake pilgrimage.
The Saudi officials have already promised that the snake will be held in Mecca and thousands of people will continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group wasn't supposed to leave the crane shoulder up when it wasn't in operation.
The Arab version of the Decree, carried out by the Saudi press agency, states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of falling.
The agency did not report this detail, but it stated that travel abroad was prohibited for the leaders of the company.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane’s fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims would correct before the Haj pilgrimage later this month.
Billadin Group did not issue any statement on the collapse of the crane and its commentaries were not made available.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not using the most recent security measures, and a lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Billadin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and has been running large construction projects.
The late leader of the Al-Qaeda Usama bin Laden was the son of an apostate whom the family had abandoned in the 1990s.
The crash has become in the middle of a strong wind and rain just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the Kingdom in a pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must have at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£ 174.000) will be devoted to the relatives killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half of this amount.
Chief B&Q claims that East Europe's traders working cheaply already have a trend
British people are increasingly employing craftsmen, claims Veronique Laura
The number of learned traders from Eastern Europe is behind the point of growth
The result is open 200 Srewfix stores aimed at traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets all over the country
processed by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for Daily Mail
The British say they put aside hammers and brushes and hand them over to busy Eastern craftsmen to work at their home.
If you're good with a hammer or a paint brush, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to work at their home, according to the head of the company for Srewfix B&Q.
Veronique Laura, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns the chain for home needs, claims that a large increase in the number of East European businessmen offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
The result is that Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Srewfix stores aimed at traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Laura says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions make better half.
At present, most male workers are male.
She said that there was a need to address the growing demographic trends that depict more women's households that make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, "We still have men working at our stores.
We need to get close to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% of decisions on goods purchases.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Laura, who is one of just five women at the head of the UK FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the equivalence between male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having half the representation of women among employees, including executive and financial director.
Laura says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't difficult to find the good women we'd take to our place.
Kingfisher announced the fall both in profit in the middle of the year and sales after the group took the cost of closing the business.
As a result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Srewfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of merit.
Mr Zbynek Stanjura, President of the ODS, noted that the one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better for him to be in the standard validation because he would also be reflected in the following years.
"We have space to find the mechanism we're going to arrange," said Stanjur.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaelaa Marks (ČSSD), according to which it was to be approved beyond the scope of the law next year.
Marks argued that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which, according to her, is not pink.
The higher avalorisation next year would mean the budgetary impact of CZK 5.5 billion and the ministers would debate about each one of the hundreds of million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right hand that the pace of valorization has been reduced in the past.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
At the right of the paycheck in December significantly complicated and may even make it difficult, he said.
The president of the ČSSD, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed a shortening of the deadline for the committee to discuss the standard for 10 or 20 days, also blocked the right.
But the committee will have a month's place for the usual two.
The bonus should cost a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money is to go mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions should increase on average by about one hundred crowns.
The contribution should be made according to the pension amendment by people who will be entitled to a pension in December or part of it.
It could also be obtained by those who died in December entitled to pension before it was paid.
However, they would have to apply for a surcharge in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions in the Czech Republic regularly valorise to January, namely price increases and a third of real wages growth.
This year, the pension is 41.5 percent gross wages, and next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent CZK 314,7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more each year.
The expenditure on old-age pensions represented 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full old-age pension last year increased by CZK 104 to CZK 10.714 according to the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided a pay-out of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17.000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin has left his plans for a political career, he'll be focusing on science.
According to the Russian media, the Senate chair was almost certain.
In the Federation Council, he had to represent the West Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov as a candidate of the government party Unified Russia in Sunday elections with an overview.
According to Russian law, senators do not vote for citizens, but they are selected by the governor from three candidates whose names they will announce before the governorial elections.
After the election, the senator will choose from the three candidates himself.
The complications were the fact that he hadn't lived in Kaliningrad for 20 years, as required by the law.
Although the Kremlin found an exception for Jakunina, he is an exceptional and authorised ambassador who is not covered by the legal requirement for long-term residence.
The film of the Czech Theory Tiger ended.
The last drop in the main hero's purpose is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has lost his strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janžurová decided about her grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to John that he and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová are on a similar journey.
Remember, once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom.
He wants to regain his rule over his life - and as a solution chooses to escape from the existing one, he told the story of Slavík.
Bajgar wanted a comedy form to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners did not feel completely free.
From the start, it was clear that the main role of Bartošk, with whom he had already worked on the Invisibility series, would begin.
Yet, he was said to have been surprised by the actor who appeared in front of the camera after a longer break associated with recovery after a serious illness.
We made a deal three years ago.
I gave him a script reading, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's probably a conglomerated athlete.
He was always asking where he was going to sit before the scene was shot.
This time he was riding a bike, climbing rocks and even going up the hill.
And the whole thing in record tropical heat, he noticed the director.
According to Bartock, women are marrying a tiger to make him a rabbit in time.
They're gonna give him some food, but they're gonna close the door so he doesn't think of playing a tiger outside of the rabbithouse.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
It is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and thinks well.
But at the same time she's a snuffer, and she wants to take care of her husband to death, said Bajgar.
The film also parallels the fates of Jan's married daughters Olina and Alice - Tánya Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and sons of Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film manufacturer is Petr Erben from Logine Production, co-productions Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The American Internet Company Google has promised to provide another up to $5,5 million (132,6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees streaming into Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday, Google.org, which is the charity of this Internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled some of the visit to Telič for criticism of human rights violations.
Czech Member of the European Parliament for the Yes movement Pavel Telička postponed the Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities canceled the official part of the visit today.
According to Telička, this is justified by the EP resolutions from last week, which criticise human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telička co-authored.
By decision of the Azerbaijani Party Telička, he lost the opportunity to interview the official partners, as well as to visit political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, he explained in the press release of his Brussels office.
Telička wanted to use the route, which was planned several months ahead, to meet with the management of the parliament and representatives of the executives, as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, he specified the text sent to the Czech Republic.
The EP resolution condemns 'unseen repression against civil society in Azerbaijan'.
She called on European officials to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent judgment on the Arbbaijan opposition journalist Chadija Ismail, who fought to expose corruption in government circles.
Russia does not exclude that it will build its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not exclude that in the future the Russian air base in Syria would be established.
We don't have such plans yet.
But nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia has in Syria an old naval base in Tartus port, which has so far been used as a service and logistics centre.
According to Russian press reports, Russian arms and military supplies to Syria have increased since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish an air base near Latakija, which for the time being remains the bastion of Syrian President Bashar Assad.
But Washington's not exactly clear about Russia's particular military intentions, the American commentators agree.
U.S. Foreign Minister John Kerry talked about the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov, it was their third phone call in the last ten days.
The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will come to Moscow next week to interpret his concern about the assembly of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Assad's support from Moscow as a lost bet.
On the objectives of Russia’s policy in Syria, he stated that they were rather unclear.
Moscow, according to him, made Syria a satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a longer-term goal, but what it is, according to Earnest, it is not entirely clear.
According to today's Russian press, the war in Syria is expected to be the main topic of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the other hand, the Russian leader said that the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas would not be good at speaking.
According to today's report, the New York Times does not exclude the US Government from meeting President Barack Obama with the Russian President during the UN meeting.
But they say that the White House advisers are breaking up.
With today's appeal to the words of Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov, the TASS Agency wrote that Putin has not yet had a meeting with Obama on the program of her New York stay.
Set sesame oil on the gallbladder diet, hemp oil helps to strengthen immunity.
The use of extra virgin oils is a good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits.
All the healthy substances will remain in the oil while pressing cold seeds.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics, Czech Republic has been the most frequent cause of death for several years.
Inflammation mainly affects women, helping sesame oil.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids that it contains are a good prevention of the formation of bile stones.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer three times more from these problems than men.
In general, problems with gallbladder mainly concern people with overweight who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can be used successfully even in a liver diet that is very similar to that gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that this oil consumes, they should be careful about the goods from the grocery stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use over-wrought seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
Oil will lose all active substances, described by Ladislav Czejececký, executive director from the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, which produces bio virgin oils pressed for cold.
The company now produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unspoiled seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our fox can draw eight kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for extra virgin designation.
There would be a loss of nutrients at higher temperatures.
Sunflower oil is beneficial for heart disease and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among oils is solar.
The Jarmila Hamersky research she ran at Masaryk University revealed that she prefers 43% of the respondents in the hot kitchen.
It is not really suitable for frying, but at 180 °C it starts to burn.
It is better to use it, for example, for seasoning of salads and is suitable especially in a diet in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids most reduce cholesterol.
In heart problems, you need to be careful about the amount of total intake of fat and calories.
For example, there are 62 calories in one spoon of sunflower oil, 99 calories in the spoon of rapeseed oil.
As far as the energy value of food is concerned, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than the so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore appropriate to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as long as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
Storage in the fridge will be longer.
Old oil will be known mainly by bitter taste.
On the contrary, there's no glitch at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
The hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical hemp are classified as superfood, and therefore hemp oil is considered to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation owes the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids can't make their own body, and you have to accept it from food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study of scientists published in the European Clinical Nutrition Magazine has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, on the contrary, the Icelandics will accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a support diet to enhance immunity and to heal the injury.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cellular membranes.
People don't have to worry about using cannabis oil, they don't have any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms that Bohemia Oil is one of the most sold.
He sells 500 liters a year.
People often use one spoon fast in the morning.
Hemp oil is not tasteful, but it will greatly strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil's karstic company.
According to statistics, Americans are the funniest nation of barbecues.
One house has a 1.4 grill.
All over the world, there are all kinds of barbecue competitions that confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs aren't behind.
On the basis of consumer surveys in the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have not been grilled in their lives.
The vast majority then grill several times a year.
To make the barbecue successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to modify the meat by marinating a few hours before the heat treatment.
What oil is the most suitable for that while keeping the health of the beneficial ingredients while grilling?
In general, fat should be saved during the barbecue process itself.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
A healthy extra virgin oil then loses the body of beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain from the consumption of oils from dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
It does not mean that the extra virgin oils will not find their use during the barbecue.
Grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When meat is said to, experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in Sokolov Region immediately get rid of grape oil.
It is wonderfully added to the taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen features a unique feature to increase the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, as one of the few oils, the health of the beneficial substance is described by Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil, one of the few Czech producers of this vine oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linolic acid, and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favorable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increase metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consumerising grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - because it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
The chefs appreciate the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example for the seasoning of salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
Thus, you can use two ways to grill, marinate and grill yourself.
Marining meat and fish will preserve their juicyness.
When preparing the marinade, there must be three ingredients: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, acidity will be delivered with apple vinegar, and so we achieve a softening of the meat.
The rooting adds the meat taste and the oil preserves and supplies the right cut, advises Daniel Wolf.
At the same time, it adds that the grape oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils it can pass through dark meat.
So, the marinated meat or fish are ready to grill, how do we proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by only a few drops to prepare meals.
The same is true for barbecues.
Some oils are completely taboo for this kind of preparation.
This applies especially to flax, hemp and rape oil, which should not be heated at all.
Wipe the grill with oil before grilling, so you prevent food from burning.
The preparation of the annexes is also an essential part of barbecue.
The grilled meat and fish can be used practically anything - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
The chefs of Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, a hot summer salad.
To him you need: • 1 pc peach • 1 pc Rucola • 1 cup of sliced cucumbers • 1 cup of salad leaf mixture • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl a pair of salad leaves topped with a sleeve, sliced cucumbers, and a sliced peach on large cubes.
According to your taste, salt and spray, you can also taste the ground chili and soy sauce.
In the end, gimme a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste then you can sow salad with finely cut tonsils.
Multiple sclerosis: it's not just medicine, it's the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, this is not only about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultations if they decide to have a child, social advice, housing adjustment, etc.
However, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient himself.
The more he fights disease actively, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change his life - style.
In fact, as doctors point out, the passivity of the sick releases room for disease activity.
For example, it is shown that regular movement significantly delays the time when the patient needs some compensation aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings should not be subject to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is why you created the site Take a chance (www.bezmytu.cz) which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Take a chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, the doctor says twice that the disease starts to heal sooner is likely to affect something.
It's because we have medication for multiple sclerosis in an inflammatory phase, when the neurodegeneration process isn't that strong yet.
The sooner we hit, the greater the hope that we can stop the disease and delay the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurology Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important in people with multiple sclerosis, which most often address weakening of the lower limbs or imbalances.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain their condition, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic bottom, reduce swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It is really individual, depending on the patient's particular difficulties," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, chief of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine Faculty Hospital in Motola.
While people with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same illness, it is manifested in a different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, movement activity also strengthens the immune status of the organism, which is desirable for multiple sclerosis.
Another positive regular exercise is the fact that the sick verify what they can do, and it strengthens their confidence.
"The endorphins are also washed up during the exercise and the person feels good about it," points out PhDr. Kamila Rásová from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine Faculty Hospital of Královské Vinohrada.
By affecting the physical side, we are acting on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
Thus we intervene directly in the mental and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"We now know that they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, the priority of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine Faculty Hospital in Motole.
The goal of physical therapy is that one can remain as self-sufficiency as long as possible, including working classification.
Therefore, the Physiotherapists work with ergotherapy to give each individual a compensation aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people shake it.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
He must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a heartbreaking soul we have to go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own.
"I work with them so that they can finally conclude that even with handicap, full life can be lived and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says the psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurology Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, airbuses didn't fly.
Air production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technology.
The new aircraft are filled with titanium or light and solid composite materials, which can't be manufactured and processed right away.
Yet it can be found next to super-precision, computer-controlled machine tools, next to autoclaves for composite forming, something as ordinary as apricot ovens.
In a drum, which resembles a pot on a cotton candy watt, the edges of the metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are cut off in a pile of ovens.
"No one has found anything better yet," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the air door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the premises in Prague Letňany, Lettov produces a complete door for Airbus A320.
Like the only ones in the world who supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors of which are composed in Prague also enter the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world's largest Airbus A380.
There's a door full of compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
Like the moment keys, the company puts together twice a year.
If there is no record of control on the yellow label, they should be able to explain to auditors from Airbus or Boeing who are regularly travelling to see if the doors are manufactured according to agreed rules.
But human senses have not been completely replaced by advanced technology.
There's 1500 rivets on one door to A320.
You've got to break the rivets manually.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the hit hammer, they will know if the rivet is already properly broken.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The rivet may rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimetre.
That's about twice the thickness of the human hair.
There'll be another trained touch on the checkout.
When the controller goes through a series of rivets, he'll know if any of them are out of tolerance.
When he takes the exact perv into his hand.
Years ago, he was living on the L-39 training program of the L-39.
But in 1991, none of them were made.
The company had to find new contracts quickly.
That's when she came together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won an emergency door tender for model A321.
The talk of Boeing wasn't that happy.
"We were there for them then a small company that didn't have enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee a long-term stable supply," recalls Dubský.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained bloated if Letov hadn't taken part in the conference of the International Air Industry Association in Prague in 1999 by the French Latecoere Group.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day the negotiations with the French started, says Dubsky.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
The assembly of the door parts for A320 started in 2000.
Three years later, the door of the upper deck was added to A380.
In 2006, the company built a new assembly hall for deliveries to the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have made it to these big orders on our own.
Maybe we could do parts or little parts.
Partners want a supply guarantee for 20 or 30 years, explains the Dubsky.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of over CZK 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
The exclusive position between suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has been investing 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 specific production processes certifications and certificates of qualification for key staff.
Without them, the company wouldn't have made any aircraft doors.
Obtain certificates that production processes meet the requirements of customers and in repeated checks keep them worth millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They're more precise and strict.
We must train the staff, equip the equipment and re-certify the entire process, supplies Dubský.
Now the company finishes the process of metaling zinc and nickel, which will replace harmful cadmium for human health.
Although the commissions were received from the manufacturer, they had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing are coming, checking the whole line's concept.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
One set of samples will test themselves in their lab and then compare the results with ours, zooming in on the Dub way in which the customers control them.
The rewards are long-term exclusive contracts for the Prague company.
With the Prague plant stands today and falls the production of embryos.
For A320 it produces half of the total volume of the door.
It is either impossible or very difficult for the Brazilian or European manufacturer to replace the Czech Latecoere.
However, it does not mean that he can say any price behind the door.
The contract includes a price curve.
It says how many doors will stand by ten, fifty, hundred made pieces.
The price for a piece keeps falling to a certain limit value.
We need to fit into this price formula.
If we don't, we're going through, she says Dubsky.
Half the hall, where electric closets are assembled for military aircraft Airbus A400 M, is still empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the cover there is a new semi-robotic line for riveting and mounting doors for the innovative A320 Neo model.
The bickering will accelerate and be more precise.
"That's the trend of installation in aviation," said Dubsky.
The rectum has a secure future line.
Airbus reports that the airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of the new A320 model.
Just a few meters away, a line will be created for the complete installation of the door for the upper deck of A380.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production time and costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubsky.
Before that, however, the company must pass the qualification tests for the installation of certain electrical and electronic door equipment for the largest Airbus.
The company is betting on further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new A350 Airbus program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"For the company it is a huge credit when it can also process compositions in addition to metal materials," says Dubský proudly.
Latecoere, however, reaches the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no more place on the site of Letov, where it is located.
Before the French mother came in, the company had 180 employees.
He's 800 now, and within three years, there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are overrun by how many hundreds of new aircraft they order every year, they don't have to worry about working.
Although my contracts for several years forward, the parent company of Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy in Prague.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay off the loans in September.
Eventually, Latecoere was able to reach out to the main creditors.
At the end of August, some of the loans were traded for shares.
The creditors gained EUR 57.4 million of the company's capital increase of 37.4 percent.
The company's debt fell by two thirds, i.e. by EUR 180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company signed new shares for EUR 222.9 million among the existing shareholders.
In total, the capital raised by EUR 280 million.
However, the entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which share 85 percent in the sales.
The average growth of contracts is expected by four percent per year until 2017.
In the contract book, he has orders for €2.6 billion, corresponding to four years of production.
The French media says that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the drips.
The Czech plant in Prague Letňany is important for groups.
The Group's sales account for 16 percent.
According to the number of employees, he is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Members supported a greater share of the state's coal charges.
The change in mineral mining charges is expected to bring CZK 427 million to the Treasury more than in 2013.
The revenue of the municipalities' budgets is expected to have a neutral impact according to the Government, because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal was around CZK 200 million and the state of CZK 66 million.
The amendment also calculates an increase in the remuneration from living space with the allowed mining per thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments shall continue to belong fully to the municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that the municipalities would receive CZK 14 million to 100 million a year.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but the government will establish it by regulation.
The remuneration shall be calculated as the sum of the amount of the extracted mineral and the rates for the individual species of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, Mr ODS Marek Benda warned that setting the fee by government might not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládek, in this case, it is not a tax, since the State charges a mineral that is a state property.
Fees shall be received only by municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the city's money and one quarter of the state's money will be received.
The same ratio will also be for the extraction of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state will collect on mining charges will be assigned purposefully.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage to mining or to provide for Baňského rescue service.
The draft was criticised by opposition MPs who claimed in particular that they would damage both the mining community and the region affected.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they did so far because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Svět) elected in the Ústí Region.
Ms Hana Aulická warned Mrs KSČM about the rise in unemployment in Mosteck.
Kadner and Aulická failed to propose the amendment to reject, Kučera wanted the law back to the government for completion.
The reasoning report states that according to mining companies, the increase in charges is not reflected in coal prices, as prices are of more than 90 percent long-term contracts.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or power plants should not feel price increases.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for their efforts to reduce their operating expenditure, which would in particular mean reducing the number of employees," the Government admits.
However, according to it, the increase in employment charges is bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment to Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial for Members to know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits before the approval of the law.
If coal is to benefit from limits, then it will have an impact on both the state and the municipality's incomes, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should not fall until 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of ČSA should be broken for social, economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time for decisions on interest rates for the American Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists addressed by the Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for a while and leave interest rates in the range 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historical event, because it's been a while since the Fed reduced its rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central bank could be able to get out of the zero box and start the process of normalising interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The US economy has done relatively well, there has been a recovery in the form of the addition of trillions of dollars to the state account and the creation of only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be ready to increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great opportunities against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00 SEC.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day and his colleague - wrote a note saying that he was "league" the first murders and that he wished he could take it back, revealed on Tuesdays government authorities.
The Gautier police in Mississippi reported that Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around 10:00 p.m.
and said he shot someone.
Lamb dispatcher asked to send cops to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a "nice dog" in the house, which "will not bother anyone," but it's upset.
The police requested the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb didn't explain why the house was shot.
When the police arrived at the scene, a 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss body and a hand - written message from Lamb said: “I am so sorry, and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message Lamb took a 300-mile long trip to Delta University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt's history teacher and then took his own life.
The dean of the University of William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that there was something happening in Mr Lamb's head.
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities indicated that there was no "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person".
There was a divorce 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "shocked" in the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald said, worked Prentiss from the house over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," said Knowles.
The police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said that he would not go to jail.
When the police raced him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods where he shot himself.
According to his CV, which he published on the school website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars Who Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
In 2001, he fought with leukaemia and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer in 2009.
The actor also had a drug problem, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
I'm sure all of these things are taxing themselves.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out of the game for a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in Liza Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this wound in tears and eliminated it for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
Injury caused the hector Moren's reckless procedure in 15 minutes when Shaw's 20-year-old was released into PSF space.
Nine minutes was treated on the playground and a oxygen mask was needed before it was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - the guy who comes to Manchester in 18 years is having a very hard time, but he plays fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the dressing rooms, he also had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in a group phase.
I believe he's going to play this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested the Italian referee was wrong.
You can assess yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their news, you can't express how ruined I am, my recovery journey starts now, and I'll come back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United reported Luke Shaw's injuries in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of a European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, a PSV coach, said, "It was a very bad injury."
When any player leaves the playground with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never the aim of our players to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered a break in his leg in the game for Mexico against Van Gaal's Dutch World Cup 2014.
"It is very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it is not good," said Coca.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
All I saw was a ball that was headed in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see the procedure on Luke.
In an interview for SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long for him to learn almost from memory.
You must not be David Cameron.
At the request of the child scheme provider to appoint his favorite children's book, Prime Minister Lorax chose a 1971 fairy tale from Dr. Seusse.
It was difficult to choose from, writes Cameron in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "A funny, touching, creative and strong content, such as I liked reading to my children because behind it was always a picture or message I had not seen before."
All right, except in the following paragraph Cameron reportedly described the story of the 2012 movie's elevator book, which added additional characters and details to fill in the brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of a girl of her dreams Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," is a brief content of the book that records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
It's as if it wasn't suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameron reads as a summary elevator of the Lorax film, which is located on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of a girl's dreams, Audrey."
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not be familiar with the history of a book where the unnamed young man will learn that the local nature is devastationing the count, trees caving the industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the title Lorax, a skewed, whistling creature who speaks for trees.
Most likely, so relatively minor PR task was given a helper who never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a piece.
Downing Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron's supporter's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was at risk of forgetting England, but still holding
Comparing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that chose England for this tour, I think it will be very unlikely to repeat the defeat of 3-0 that she suffered in the trial series last time.
I wouldn't rule out winning the guests, either.
The side of Alastair Cook may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in this paddling line and also collective thinking is strong; they will not bear scars from 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although he is unknown at the level of the test series, represents an offensive possibility.
Related: Adam Lyth fell off the team of England in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lyth is hard for me to analyze, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were against two good attacks in difficult conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that the Cricket players are judged by performance.
For example, there were no questions around Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and this I have mentioned earlier — players are their best choicers.
A few more decades, and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performance was not 100%, and I am not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time a bat to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth received seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only thing you might be able to retaliate is that England gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in the best form — but this wasted opportunity is already the past.
Alex Hales is here, and that's a bat I'm very positive about.
He's the x-factor of the cricket that we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he got 236 against us on the Trent Bridge field, which it kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all of this will, of course, depend on the total lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting at Cook's side, who would get another extra spinner while he kept four quicks, was brought up and I have no reservations against her.
I don't understand why the starfisher can't launch, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 tests before his 2001 performance.
He immediately made three centuries and didn't even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and when I had the opportunity to follow him, he caught me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I can see that as a pram, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the electors decided for their youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
Appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, sr. lanka bat, as a consultant for trial matches can be a master's move.
He's one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming in part of the white-ball tour, bringing both energy and a merciless spark to the team.
I always felt he was directly born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and just like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, although they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten up and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's partner Ben Stokes got one day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree, trainers and electors do not create a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
Rexit could win if the economy starts stagnating by 2017.
The inconceivable strategy of the renegotiation of David Cameron for Britain in the EU gets into other problems with every last day and without the election of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn leads the Worker's Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat has recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - of which not all are their fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and disturbing changes to the treaty that most of them do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that they would not want it even if they took up social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolis, take a picture before the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they win an ally for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to have an unnoticed Britain in Europe - "Do not leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they do not care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German carefully balanced Chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad, as was the case with too long-lasting Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande is facing re-elected or replaced in 2017.
His power is falling, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It's hard to see them breaking their legs in helping Selfie Brits who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may plan deliberately useless SNP-style notes during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in the UK to speed up the Rexit process, claims a friend.
"Renegotiations solved the problem" and "Britishia has nothing of value from negotiating."
Europeans know for their own harm how expensive Fleet Street can be and how sceptical the press oligarchs of the EU are because they were not inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 at 2:1.
They can remember the name Boris Johnson, a protracted Euro-Oportunist who made his name as Brussels's "EU straight banana" rapporteur at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of badgers who don't pay taxes, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo non-Sea departments that owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a mad gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she wouldn't have you for dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routines since Blair accepted the principle of the repealed EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and gained a card to be fired.
The press never forgave him.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on my back on Monday at Westminster - I told him that he should not waste any more time on me - seems at risk of re-introduction of Murdoch Neil Kinnock's boycott strategy, which was a mistake at that time.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose seat he left with the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official position towards Europe, I'll say it nicely, it's developing.
He claims that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's insane tendency and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly accept that.
That's what Hilary said, "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said on radio and television this week when his inner scout couldn't have made the decision to admit that Corby's appointment as the shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - apparently not what McDonnell said or what JC told his colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever background, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to tell - don't forget, he touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of day-to-day television and especially in faith, partying paranoia and treachery, which are social media
It is fair not to provide Cameron with a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Worker's Party in a referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corby's basic scrappings about EU membership - in line with their Bennite's overlapping economy, the anti-Capitalist past - are no longer just an esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for which narcissism is the central essence of dogmatism.
Just as with his cracking about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions, when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is quite disappointed by the British "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of conservative government in power, as I was reminded on Monday of the launch of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticise an electronic review published by Public Health England
The government-funded declaration by the Agency that electronic cigarettes are 95 % safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are connected to the tobacco industry, states researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet's criticism of the evidence used in its report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE published the "limit" report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the extent of data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, he attacked the "excessively chatty base" at which PHE based its main findings.
Two other experts who wrote for BMJ questioned the claim that was allegedly "on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They say that the public might expect the claim of the PHE agency, which is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people invited to produce an analysis of the multi-criteria (MCDA) decision-making model to synthesize their views on damage linked to various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell stated that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had previously received funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved the public health mandate of BAT in the sustainability report.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting granted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding previously received from Philip Morris International tobacco company.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available but contains several known electronic cigarette champions, some of which also declare industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some of the others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PHE was also attended by tobacco lines.
The report from this group "speakably admits," the missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria," was written by McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE claims that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smoking people," it was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, stated that the claim at BMJ had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two smokers of life dies because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small compared to, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows, and also what they do not display, especially when there was so much confusion about relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die annually from smoking and smoking diseases cost NHS £2 billion a year.
With clear emphasis on the current evidence - that even if e-cigarettes are not without risk, they carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fill our national competence.
BBC should end up with EastEnders, says former Director of Channel 4.
Former Director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "put their right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for setting up public service programs that would probably only follow a handful of people into difficult broadcast times compared to his rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After General Director Tony Hall said that the corporations wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had failed to make contact with the BBC for six years, which he had worked on Channel 4.
"I am fighting the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without State contributions," said Johnson in the Communication Commission in the Upper House as part of the BBC's future negotiations.
If you maintain licence fees that I am not sure are a good idea in the medium to long term, it should be reduced in terms of programmes that are not produced or not made.
They're broadcasting The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should support programmes that can be financed without contributions.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and, of course, produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would have their right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur in the area of series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty for catching up on ratings "for the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the most popular show BBC repeats those that former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC will sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more turbulent BBC public service programs "goes to BBC4, where quite often it is not possible to measure the audience, but fulfil their powers and can argue when they are preparing for their hypocritical mission to justify £4bn income from license fees, "But of course we do all these obscene programs that no one is looking at."
They're broadcast at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the licence fee, Johnson said to the Commission: "I call on you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best out of it.
Of course, we all think that £150 a year is a huge sum, but for people who are £150 a lot worth, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at the BBC.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared in front of the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should review its Reithian mission in the sense of "information, education and entertainment."
He confirmed that the small production volume of BBC was previously classified as an educational one - it was 1% of television production and 0.1% of radio - and should take the role of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "information, clarification and entertainment".
On the subject of Elstein's partnership, he said that the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were only broadcast a handful on television, and join with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
Sonogenetics or brain cell control by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the nebulae move.
Scientists raised worms with genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Tiny nebulae change direction when they are affected by sound impulses that are inheart for the human ear.
The pulses work by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists have said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian daily that this method might one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes are put into the patient's brain that stimulate the brain. The method is used e.g. to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Amphibians don't usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found out that the reaction would come when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, bubbles amplify ultrasound waves that then pass through the worm body.
Increased ultrasound waves are active in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open up and activate the cells they're connected to are reported in the report by Nature Communications.
To control the nebulae by ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the ion channels TRP-4.
When he then used the modified ultrasound worms, the sound waves were strengthened by microbubbles and transferred to worms where modified motor neurons turned on.
The new method is similar to optogenetics, a pioneer tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons by light.
Chalasani, however, heard that sonogenetics could have many advantages compared to this technique.
Unlike the light that must be sent by optical fiber to the desired site in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissues without limitation and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
Inserates that shame the British arms deal.
Look at Amnesty International's anti-weapon market video.
Horrible killing drones!
The windows on the legs that break the ankles!
The Third Missiles!
And electric stunning batons that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
Merry voice and cartoon metaphors leave no one in doubt that this ad at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International due to the emphasis on British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through defense and security devices International Veselice at ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with posters in bus stops and subways that require a second view.
"Important announcement, Travelling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using letters with brands of London metro with DLR lines becoming an image of the tank.
This September, the hive of arms dealers will descend to DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their works at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collective called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute them all over London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen key, which allegedly "takes access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not screwed by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the Collection Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and specialist assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists move on to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world to have their art impact on society.
Another of the posters against arms trafficking, health passengers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed on Facebook by over 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without a right to a fee and graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
The creative director of the VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the quiet surrounding ads about arms trafficking - he saw an empty spot in the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that he's trying to avoid."
They used to play with the creation of a more realistic, risky company ad, but "adding colour and animation, I've achieved more people's capture."
"They did a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take measures to ensure that torture facilities are not legally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In the press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army to "on the AT4CS RS launch arm."
This includes "a uniquely shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules for life at college
11 years ago, I moved to college as an unnoticed 19-year-old, still believing in baret and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the tense smiles of those I objected to - and numerous, lengthy complaints at the other.
Anything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the track can move from slightly to a nerve that goes all the way to a total shock.
It's tempting to be babbling: telling people where you are, if you've taken a year's break, what you think of Corbyn, and why "you don't really love Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from HAHAHAHA yeast, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath too - ask questions and a sign of interest.
It manages the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and those you wouldn't have had fun with, even if your algae were in one fire, and they would release fire extinguishers.
Leave room for the people.
People's rooms are often changed to drinking receptions, movie evenings and communal public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress up and adjust their underwear.

Introverts in college will simply come.
Your room should be a haven, yet a lot of tracks turn into an extra-room walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
It could be hell for someone who needs to charge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can go back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialization and maybe write him a knock-off.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
One kid in my dormitory used to say that if the door isn't locked, he's invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by baking.
Since you started going to the university at the top of a burning mania, knocking on a stranger's door and making a show with a plate of baked cakes seems slightly less strange, less than "welcome to the neighborhood, I made you something, now smile while I ask questions personal."
Offering home delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe everything will end up assigning your face to a delicious surprise.
Of course, that's the subject of you being a decent baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and rigidity are likely to cancel that the others will pretend to sleep if you try to knock on their doors.
Food theft is a common crime on college colleges.
Theft of the whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is there a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There's a chance your milk will be offered even if it's in the air.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more grown-up than my roommate, who traded her milk as a means of washing dishes to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make sounds that disturb people's sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could quieten up some drum and bass because they were three at night and she had a test in the morning.
Their answer was to enhance music.
When they finally got quiet at 5 in the morning, she left them to sleep for two hours and then released her own music, locked the door and left for her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband went to the same college as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be terribly embarrassing if you confused your roommates for your future spouse, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe take control of your common friends as well?
Of course, you don't sentence your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future wife, try to talk to your weak children a little bit.
At an uplifting moment, when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there's only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and give them the keys to the water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their things to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a busy time as she was pregnant today with a seven-year-old Vietah.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone in preparing and raising her offspring.
I dealt with this situation quite quickly - I looked forward to a child and looked forward to it.
Uncertainty and the fact that I'm alone with a child, I've tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we wouldn't be alone for long, remembers Eve's first pregnancy today.
She already met on the Internet at an old Vashka house, which they started talking to about favorite movies.
Your father's stepdad didn't take too much into the role of your stepdad.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," said Eva on the documentary series Four in Volume 3.
The motive of the third series of Czech television is the search for happiness for the second attempt.
Worship and family financial security were managed thanks to part-time work and the great help of mother and aunt.
Even the prospects for responsibilities for a foreign child finally did not spoil Vaskov’s affection for Eve.
They finally got together around the Second Birthday, and now he understands Vaška as his father and he also calls him that way.
Even though Vašek has two adult daughters, fatherhood in his 60s enjoys his words, and he also devotes more to children.
In addition to Vítka there was a two-year-old Leontchen and finally two-year-olds.
"Your mother never talked to me very much into our family," she thinks, smiling Eve.
Not much room?
At least we're close.
Em's twins and Ela were born with an imperial cut after Eve was diagnosed at the end of pregnancy with pregnancy cholestasis.
This is a disorder in the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excess of the amount in the blood pregnant and manifests in particular itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn child, who is at risk of early birth and death, usually resolves spontaneously in the mother after childbirth.
Ema and Ela were born healthy to Eva and Vaskov, although they were only 36 weeks old.
The Em was placed in an incubator in the intermedian department, where Vaskova's niece was working, which managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after she was transferred from I.I.P. to the room I had her with me, describing the difficult period after Eva was born.
In the hospital she spent 20 days until the doctors agreed to release babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
Waiting to receive children in Eve’s hospital was no joy.
"I was crazy about my husband's and children's steak," remembers the hard moments in Section Six Sundays, the four-time mother.
She considered signing the reverse with her husband, including the insensitive approach of one of her physicians.
However, this did not end and the doctors released Eve and the twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancys and births are broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday night at 21:45.
A large family can be reduced.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to stand out with an electric two - fence and tight conditions.
The house did not grow, but yours made Eve happy by installing a gas cooker to prepare meals for six people more comfortable.
If it gets worse, we'll be changing for a cab.
Eva is convinced that children are especially aware of family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size or ugliness of the house.
For the time being, we've been together a lot better than we expected.
The mess is worse hiding in a small space, and sometimes we cross babies, but at least we're all around, smiling Eva, who can find a positive side in every situation.
Vaskov's work of lighting in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In his 60 years, according to his words, care for family finances and children physically manages how long does it take, but how long does it take?
"I realize that, given our age difference, it will be me who will feed this family," admits Eve straight in questioning the future.
She'd like to go back to work, but she's even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
I'm not exactly the name of the employer with four kids.
And if it gets worse, my husband and I can take a cab, play nice blonde.
Apple's been affected by a yo-yo effect.
It's the display's fault.
The more powerful processor, a camera with a higher resolution, a firmer scale, or a display that recognizes the power of the touch, are short of the priority of the recently introduced Ninth Generation iPhones.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weights of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
Because Applu's trend to date was that every new generation of iPhones is lighter than the previous ones.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the failure of the news was really negligible.
But this is far from true for the new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight grew 14 grams in a smaller model and 20 grams more.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that last year the bending affair in Apple's pockets has suffered a great deal.
The scale of the news is thus a more resistant aluminum alloy 7000, which was also reflected in the weight.
But they have a much greater impact on her.
Apple used 3D Touch technology in the news, which allows displays to recognize the power of touch.
To this end, it was necessary to provide the display with another layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of new iPhone displays has increased more than doubled compared to previous generations.
At the smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams per 29 grams, in case of larger from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s the display is the hardest part used.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved in this new product thanks to the defatation bark that touched most of the remaining components.
For the larger model, the most difficult part of the battery used is, however, its weight has not changed compared to the predecessors.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is seen just at the display.
The weight of 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
To what extent the new display technology will be practical, it will manifest itself only when used.
The first users will be able to try this on Friday, September 25, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will start in selected countries.
Has the flakes been breakfast champions for tens of thousands of years?
In Italian Grotta Paglicki, archaeologists were able to find a way to open up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by a modern person from different times, including wall paintings, tool remains and so on.
In layer 23A, which according to the tools is dated up to about 30 thousand years ago but scientists discovered something that very much resembles the remains of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, traces of oat grain were found on the site, which apparently went through the process of producing so popular flakes today.
With it, the grains are wet first today, then dry, freed the packaging, then the so-called pluch, then burned and poured in the soil.
In the cave Paglicki managed to discover grains which seemed to have been heated or burned, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least that's what traces of use on two rocks in the cave.
Thus, scientists were unable to prove in their publication for PNAS that there would be a complete process of production of flakes in the cave, but the similarity is really very obvious.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some fluid and quite possibly warm is, of course, offered quite logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensive people used cereals long before the creation of agriculture.
In fact, if the trawling interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have preceded agriculture by approximately 20,000 years.
New reports of stations in the Transport Company of Brno City.
So I once again listened to the names of the stops in Trolejbus: Dwarf, Sight, Frazov, Spratecká.
Of course, the Trolebus was somewhat louder, so the report with a male voice was somewhat less understandable than before when the stops came out with a female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in deeper traffic noise it is more discernable than a deeper male voice.
The DPMB argued that the passengers themselves chose this speaker - I do not know who, I was asked by anyone, but they certainly chose from the studio recordings made in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than the noise of the bus engine.
I've been living in Brno for a few decades, so the correct names of all these stops I know from memory, so I don't need this report, but strangers who don't know each other in Brno, and for whom these reports are primarily intended, can be confused, and can finally, where they arrived by mistake, then claim that the stop they were supposed to come out of, was not reported at all.
Maybe the caller selection should be made - but better again the callers - again, and this time it's stained with regular traffic noise and engine carving, in which the skimming of the speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So that we don't have to listen to the names of Heršpice, Šmírov, or Ponorná stations in the squealing scarf I moved to in Komárov.
I suppose my old hearing didn't suddenly get so much worse during the only day that the announcer changed.
Before that day, I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, comrade chief.
From the tracker's notes.
Today, few people know what was the biggest and smartest part of the party’s government was called comprehensive checks.
I took the liberty of remembering it.
The bus was late.
I hit the dispatcher's office the minute the radio sounded like it was just seven hours ago.
"You're lucky you didn't meet the comrade chief, came in a minute before you, and it seems like he's not in the mood," said the dispatcher while I was writing into the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I'm on a minor mechanization review after the districts.
I can't do that. I mean, today's the checkup.
They're all fucked up. They're scared.
What's going on?
"You'll see," the dispatcher slipped.
You'll be next time.
I ran out in the hallway.
That's when the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.
Sticky, with a stone face, in perfectly falling uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," said I respectfully and quickly turned on two buttons of jacket uniforms.
"Good morning," said the answer, and I quickly ran out to the second floor without realizing the cold, evil tone that the old one answered.
"You're playing," the engineer Eva welcomed me, an elderly lady who I greatly appreciated.
She said she was even the chief before the comrades put her down.
They're checks, and you're gonna make it.
How many times have I asked what these complex checks are, but nobody wants to talk about it very much?
They're said to be once every three years, they all have to be there, and it's very uncomfortable.
At least for some.
I'll see.
I pulled a fascist from the drawer with periodic reports and that phone.
"Here, Holcman, come to me right away," said the chief's voice.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met, and nothing has been said, but no one has answered me, everyone with their thoughts.
"Hello, comrade Chief, I came to your command," I checked myself out, I barely entered the chief's office.
The chief was sitting at the writing table looking at some shithead.
"Son Mechanizer," he said, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the leper on the table, leaned on the back of the chair, and looked down on me with the usual, unpleasant, mean, slender look.
I'm not.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised me for working very well in my office over the past few months and being very happy with me.
That the chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon at the distance.
And now this?
Just remember, you're a track distance technician, and you have to act accordingly.
Such a greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I said that I've been using such a greeting since I was a kid, that I've been raised so much and that I don't see anything wrong with him.
It was like a red turkey rag to the chief.
"You're on a socialist railway, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the work," says the inflated chief.
And besides, you're still confusing to approach the superiors.
One day, you say "sir" and the other, "sister."
But I'm not the Chief for you, I'm the comrade chief.
Vice-Presidents are fellow deputys, chief routers are comrades at the top of the tracker!
Just remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... I have greeted you with a simple civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of work or comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your priority that you're not on the side," said the cold chief, who, in the meantime, calmed down a little bit.
There's still going to be talk about it.
Anyway, remember, there's no pre-retirement chair up here.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his priority, it didn't look good with the guy in question.
He stabbed me for a while with a cold, sleazy look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also upset by his high-end sticking.
He was only a few years older and played God, actually comrade.
Inflammable, inflated, authoritarian, arrogant, how he could use it at the moment.
He's been fired by everyone.
Fair enough, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, as all the parties, but also the non-participating ones, pushed him.
But the chief was pushing many, especially those with whom he might have exercised his sovereignty.
He shot me right now for total bullshit.
I thought about some shit, and it cost me a lot of effort not to shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't go back to being a badass again, let alone a railway officer.
What would I do with two kids?
And a built-in house!
I was crying, but I took over.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all so far, you can go," ended the audience with the Chief, and began to look closely again at the lejster that he had in his hand earlier.
I got called in at 7:30.
Everyone at the office was there and asked what and how, they said, "Yeah, it's gonna be okay."
Only Jožin had a bit of a saying, as his custom used to be, that they can't throw us all out because he would have to do the job with his fellow chief himself, and that he's not threatening to do the job.
The word "sister" pointed out as if he knew what the old man had shot me for this morning.
There was a nice meeting in the chief's office.
Comrade Chief at his writing table and at the long advisory table, other comrades who should have decided on my official being or not being.
Kadrovák, chairman of ROH, writer of personnel, referent for special purpose, something in the way you continue to be in the military, and a deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from scratch.
The usual track worker, he undercut the prams or the fork tossed the gravel.
But he's also a former guard.
It was said there was no fun at the time, he said a nice beast.
Bad languages said the school came out in seventh grade, he didn't learn anything, he couldn't learn anything.
And when the criminal was canceled, he ended up in a fight with a crook.
But comrade, yes, the comrade was knit!
The Chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an inconclusive neck.
Kadrovák read the Citizen Committee's report from his place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two children and so on and so on.
So far, it's okay, I've thought, and I've been breathing a little better.
Then a judgment from the street organization of the party.
He copied the Citizen Committee's report, and I hope they're both written by the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of long-term party members refused to appear before the examination committee and then proceeded from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked very hard at me.
Kadrovák noticed and stopped reading.
The Chief has instructed him to proceed.
It's only been worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee, and there I was won as a candidate for the party.
Regardless of the parents who spoke from the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and I also had a wedding outside of the National Committee at the church.
I have failed to trust the party in the worst way possible.
That's why I've been cut out from among her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, sent out a church funeral, although it was a former party member.
In all this, I am showing a negative attitude towards the leadership of the party.
When he finished reading, only the taping of the chief's pencils in the table interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone looked down on me and I wished I was somewhere far away.
I kept saying to myself, "Communists - superhuman, communists - superhuman." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stick with the blacksmiths?
I could've fixed the switches without some fucking clearance.
But now?
She took the career of a railway officer before she started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think that's gonna work, chief's gonna fire me for an hour.
"Son, how did you examine this comrade here?" interrupted the tense silence chief question of the blacksmith.
Well, according to the previous employment report.
Do you have it here?
Apparently, Kadrovák hasn't been around.
At the groins of sweat, he blinked nervously, as if he himself had been tested.
He nodded and handed over some paper to the chief.
"Well," said the chief with a hint of jealousy, but often it was a foreman of storm.
At first sight all praise, taught with honour, studied industry, worked in task wages as a castle, met the standard on average to a hundred and twenty percent.
But it's a big deal.
Where did you get the judgment, comrade?" he turned to the man who felt it was starting to turn against him and that he might not have to be a cadre very soon.
This is where my comrade gave it to me when he boarded.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the platoon district," the bleak.
And there's no need for judgements, and his was kind of an extra one, so I put him in his file.
"So that this bar of paper was enough for you when you were assigned to the technical function," said the chief.
The cadron was nervously winking, and he was unanswered.
"It's okay, we'll discuss it later," concluded the chief and apparently the cadre's case.
For the time being, it stopped.
"So what about you, comrade?" The chief turned to me again.
I'm outta here, so it's over!
It was dark in my eyes, hot in my eyes.
There was a flood of regret and accusations, and I knew that I was the most repulsive creature in the world that didn't deserve the slightest mercy.
That I misjudged the comrade of the castor referent by substantiating the incomplete report, and I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I received it from the castor in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist figure who, at the time of building real socialism, supports the world of religious darkness, or even participates in it.
That, that was a lot of things I've done, or maybe I'll still do, and I've been praying it's over.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I left the mechanizer's place.
I didn't care if they took the rascal.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of comrade chief.
"That's enough, comrade chief," said the chairman of the party and strongly interrupted the chief's left.
This is where the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did a stupid thing!
But he's already had his punishment!
Don't forget that, comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than we would close his door to the side for a while!
In order to open up again, he will have to prove that he has changed that he is worthy again of our trust.
An uneducated guard spoke as a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so read or parroted the phrases from partial training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade has to get a chance from us!
A chance to prove that he's changed.
And who's to give it to him if not you, comrade chief?
It is your duty to this young, true, somewhat mistaken comrade, to support his efforts to correct!
It's your party duty that no one will ever get rid of you!
Actually, it's a party duty to all of us.
This is where the comrade needs to see that the party has not forgotten him.
As a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the chairman was done, no one even heard.
No one expected such a turn-off.
At least me.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade Chairman," said the chief of the ice to try to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd have heard that I was headed for that conclusion.
They all agreed to nod their heads, but it was obvious that they didn't believe a word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate referent to care for the basics," I shone when I returned to the office and then I cried.
It's a good thing they were all at lunch besides Eva's engineer.
The silence was listening to my unparalleled screening of fresh experiences, and in the meantime, I calmed down.
When I was done, she asked if I'd have coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the cook and was going to make cups.
In the meantime, she's been talking about cadre practices.
Like one judgment, often full of praise, they will put man in the hand, and the other one, in which there is dirt, will send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to be, but at the crackhouse, so the factory comrades didn't know where to send it.
And our cadaver?
He only cares where he eats or drinks, and that's how it ended.
"He's got it from the old man," she said.
I'm sure he won't like it tonight.
You watch him anyway, he's very vengeful.
And the party president?
In fact, far worse chief, no humane.
Zero from a crap with a lot of power.
Coffee water started to boil and then the office filled in the smell of coffee.
I threw sugar in the cup and the silences mixed a hot potion.
I hope I'm the worst out there.
They won't fire me now, and the next checks are in three years.
Anyway, comrade chief doesn't just forget me today.
It was published in the anthology of LITERT ON TRATI II. in the publishing house of PIKA
The symbol of the village came to life.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum has turned again after years.
You can see from a distance, because it's located 15 meters above the high mast.
People in the wide area call him "the wind on Chlum".
For the village, 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the municipal mark which the village gained for the occasion of the 2010 reunion of the natives.
"We applied for a sign then, and the fan on the mark of course we wanted to have, of course, everyone knows him around," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlumské wind pump is a local technical monument.
He is a memento of the present: he recalls the time when people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chluma in recent centuries was rare.
Only in 1910 did the Flumish representatives decide for the solution, which then met until the middle of the 1980s.
In the village near the branch office in Číchov, they had a deep well excavated seven metres.
Three years later, they completed the well with a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reserve at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranice in Moravia by a cost of CZK 2 400," says the memorial inscription on the ground flooring of the construction of the mast.
The pumped after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel served in 1971.
On 7 May 1973 a new chapter of the fight for water began to be written: on that day in Chlum a new water supply began to serve.
The wind pump remained only a non-functional municipal symbol and its rarities.
The Dominant was established at this year's home reunion.
Only in 2008 did the Chlumsy decide to fix the windmill again and bring it back into operation.
They made a replica of the original wheel - reduced on average by half a metre.
The wheel was mounted on a mast, but the same year it had to be carried down.
The replica producer did not choose the right material and the wheel could not resist the wind.
Then, for several years, the Chlumsian dominant rested under the roof.
From this June, however, the bike on the high mast has been turning again.
On the occasion of the reunion, the village had a replica of the wheel modified and again planted it at the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel only pumps utility water from the well into the ambushed blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we cut him off completely because there was little water in the well.
At least it turned out empty.
"In autumn, we will remove the shaft of the windwheel from the pump in the suction basket again," explained Mayor Mašek.
The chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel has come into the common character, but it is the only village of this kind on the whole of Vysočina.
In honour of local technical monuments, such as Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in Vyškovsko, in Kuželov in Hodonínsk, Partutovice in Přerovsko or in the Police in Vsetínsko.
No hard feelings, but I don't know Lafata, she admitted the resistance to Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, even my goal, like everyone else in my career," smiled at the 34-year-old Goian for the pre-game press conference.
That's when George Hagi trained us, it was a shame we lost.
I hope I give my goal now to Sparta.
Only with the difference that we will not lose this time," Goian continued.
This man who played 60 games for the Romanian team is the key support of the Greek team.
As a tracker, he will face the raids of the Spartan offensive.
There's a few thousand people coming, no hell, talking about the Greek struggle, the Spartan Hybš.
And partly knows what he can expect on Thursday night.
I know Fatai well, who played Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
At the time, I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good attacker, which is why he went to Sparta, said Goian.
He did not name any other football players in Prague, and so came the direct question of if he knows David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and aimed at Czech journalists with a slightly respectable look.
The helpless look on his face was like, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a while, he shut down.
We saw some videos, and I noticed Sparta was playing a lot of teams.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
No hard feelings, but I don't know anyone else but Fatai.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
"My experience from bigger clubs can be said to hold the defense of Asteras, he's such an organizer of the game," observed the Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Although the Goian has been in its best years, it can boast a very interesting football resume.
He was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both United and City Manchester units, from Steauy, but headed for the Italian palerma, and he played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says coach.
Sparta is a large team, regularly playing European cups, fighting for victory in the Czech League.
For me, he's a favorite in this game, but we're playing at home, and we're trying to get the group started with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, said Goian.
I am in a room with Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very excited about the opponents from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola moves from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new residence should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland because of the trading of shares in the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
For the time being, the steps we have taken within the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no real impact on events in the company, says Daniel Buryš, Financial Director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the group's head office, shareholders consider the placement of shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the stock exchange, Prague is finishing up a valuable paper prospectus that will be submitted by the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the premises of the holding and the related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating in it.
Therefore, no public subscription shares or new investors will be offered under this operation.
"The possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Czech TV objectivity test in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of reporting of the major Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time the broadcast of the main news session of the Czech Television.
And how did she stand?
When they teach the media how to manipulate reality at the journalism faculty, they can launch today's Czech Television Event.
The migration crisis was devoted to about 80% of the news broadcast.
Except for the first minute that the CT reported the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on the police called them euphemistically out of patience - throwing stones and attacking with metal bars), the current pro-migrant propaganda - assess the names of individual reports themselves.
Critics of NGOs - great room for non-profit organisations that criticise mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in Czech school - story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Running refugees - CT consistently uses the expressions runner or fugitive and not the migrants.
The most striking thing is that the CT uses consistently only and only images of young children and women in illustrations.
In the same broadcast alone, she said that 80% of the migrants in the Czech Republic were held.
Summary: Mostly propaganda, which does not have similarities from communist agitators.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once got up for a panel apartment, I soon stopped being the only resident.
My fish moved into the restroom.
Domestic fishnets, insects with imperfect transformation, i.e., the making of that conversion from the caterpillar to the bug and the young looks like an adult individual, just a tiny and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't eat them off.
First hand and later chemically.
The socialist drugstore at their disposal provided some kind of blue crystal.
I think it was called Cyclon B.
Or something else?
However, they have been eliminated successfully.
Later, I dealt with the Pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with some kind of juvenalizer that the ants brought into the nest, and then he wouldn't let the queen generate a new offspring.
But that's what I turned around.
As time went by, the insects became the subject of my admiration and I tended increasingly to think that they have the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I learned from life that intervention into the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace the other.
The truth about the fleas and puppies I don't think I'd unwrapped to make karma worse by killing them.
At the new housing site, my partner and I agreed that if the fishes don't fall behind our necks, let them eat the skins of apostate, some invisible algae and so on.
After a while, their peaceful existence disturbed the spider.
He was a common kind of street-walker who had long been on the ceiling.
We thought he was living out of occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only made us feel more comfortable.
Because he lived in our country for several years, we found that he mainly feeds on ponds and that their numbers were apparently maintained in a bearable number.
By reliable regular contact at every need, we found out that she was a female.
We have seen romantic abuses with our partner about a third less, how carefully it breaks to the fibres of the web so that it is not eaten before it reaches the desired copulation.
It took about three days for them not to move and to react to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl where love games were played, we later found the remains of a dried-up male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by a lot of little spiders hanging a variety around her.
They disappeared soon.
They were eaten by their mother, and they ran away elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared somewhere after a week.
If she left or passed away, we don't know, but after a month or two, she came back on the ceiling.
That's right, a little bit smaller, probably the daughter of the landowner of the toilet.
She watched our behavior carefully from the ceiling for a while, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she evaluated our non-attacks as friendship.
The number of slightly multiplied fishes decreased again, and the spider looked at his usual activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed in a year.
Our daughter between that and her age, when the use of the potty was already a disgrace.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've had to eat eternal pouring of its contents.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more.
However, in order to maintain her habit, the daughter found an excuse in the spider that she saw very well while she was washing.
Our talk of seeing a spider, of not having any luck in the house.
She was crying and screaming and forcing her potty.
It wasn't too much.
There was a time when a spider had to be in order to develop his daughter, to command.
It's left to me.
He was caught in a glass and reported through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I was saying goodbye to him as a friend, but after such a long time of cohabitation, I felt like I was throwing away a relative.
We assumed that the fishes would start to appear more frequently and begin to multiply with a geometric series.
The world wonders, a week, two, none of us showed up.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if there was a spider in there like ants that didn't somehow grow that the toilet environment wasn't as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were all over again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured out that their connection to the spider had to have a reason to believe that if they didn't see him hiding somewhere else and that they were at risk from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some telepathic connection to their predator and his rapid disappearance caused some kind of alarming reaction.
It's just that I don't have any illusions about their eyes.
There was some light pamphlet, but they would react to the wavering of hands or fast moves, no.
My daughter's already in the bathroom on a regular basis.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
All that's left is to attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wish to the ether, and I hope they didn't shut down after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that cyclone B.
Ten words by Albert Einstein, which has enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the last century apparently never cease to be fascinating.
He was able to submerge everything so deep that it was always an amazing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
Its special and general theory of relativity has entered the consciousness of people, which has so far been best described by the universe in its giant relationship.
It is also not possible to ignore its clarification of the photofect or the idea of quantification of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the popular theory of relativity itself and the system of knowledge is so complex for many, that they prefer to choose the easy odds for a closer acquaintance.
But it's not easy.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: An hour close to your beloved seems to be a minute; a minute in a hot furnace seems to be an hour - and that's relativity.
I've taken the liberty of choosing from his entire ploy of famous quotes these ten, which have literally taken away from me.
Smart people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experiments can ever prove that I was right.
But at any time, the only one can prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of a mess in the mind, then what reflects an empty table?
I don't know what he's gonna do in World War III, but it's gonna be sticks and stones in the fourth.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and know much too.
If I had an hour to handle a problem that would depend on my life, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The world's most difficult thing to understand is income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive Einstein's formula for the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula: A=X+Y+Z, where X is the job, Y rest and Z is to hold the tongue for the teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are expecting changes for 1.5 billion.
"It's a success, considering that all four of them are stuck in black numbers this year," said captain Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of regional facilities is about 32 million crowns at the moment.
This is mainly due to higher remuneration from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Krokoříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště i Zlin, the building will become almost 1.5 billion crowns together.
The long time we bought mainly machines ended.
Now we need to start building new buildings, because without them the top health care cannot be done, justified the plans of the Regional Deputy for Health Lubomír Nečas.
He is looking forward to changes in all hospitals.
The builders will be coming to the hospitals next year.
In Vsetin, suppliers now choose a new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
In Krokoříži, they have planned a dialysis port.
Uherské Hradiště wants to introduce a new international internet for about 200 million to the open central pavilion this year.
And the Zlin Baťa Hospital awaits a long delayed construction of a new central income and an internal one, which will require three quarters of billions.
In all cases, these are the most important and often biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors this is an extremely important step," said the director of the hospital Věra Prousková for example.
The five-storey building there is supposed to be finished in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for both internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
More comfort for patients.
Changes, which are mainly known by patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many people lie in one room, they have only one toilet on the floor, the beds are inseparable, the windows leaky and the health care professionals do not have the right conditions for work.
"For example, our internet was built 35 years ago and is now at the limit of its lifetime," Pavel Calábek, director of the Zlin hospital, pointed out.
Within a few years it will therefore be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected to an urgent income.
Both doctors and patients will have all the acute departments at one place, in addition in new areas.
The same model already has half finished Uherské Hradiště.
The central income is already standing, and there will be an internet to it within three years.
"We will pay the construction from the loan and partly from our own funds," said Director Petr Sládek.
This hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
The profit is still high, and it didn't get into loss two years ago, when, for example, the zlinian hospital faced almost two hundred million dollars of loss.
"We have good insurance contracts, excellent performance, we increase income and we effectively manage the costs of the whole hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who has the economy in charge.
The improvement will be achieved by patients of non-Kieříž hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, it will go to repairs, new instruments and reconstructions of up to half a billion crowns.
Already this year will be a complete repair of the capture station, then the extension of the dialysis will start, or the construction of the building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one has explained to me how I should keep admitted refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
The Minister of Interior Milan Khovanec (ČSSD) complains that the other countries of the Czech Republic are pushing to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but they reject any discussion.
He also points out that no one has explained to him how he should keep his assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," he told the journalists.
Can you describe more specifically the position with which you came to the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas such as a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants like sacks of salt or flour.
They're living beings who have visions, they're going somewhere, they have relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we were able to keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not get the answer, and that is why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we say this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
We've been dealing with forty thousand recently, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When's 500 grand?
And how are we supposed to keep these people in this area?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
We don't want almost anyone to join us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnameses and others who take the Czech Republic as the destination country are going to gain asylum in our country, but the interest of people from this migratory wave, namely from Syria and other countries, is very close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees didn't really want to come to us, but 15 hundred people were already committed to accepting.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept more of them this way?
We have undertaken to accept 1500 people, but on condition.
We said functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even with the 1500, there will be 1100 people to deal with asylum procedures.
They're coming to our detention facility and we're going to treat them the same way we treat those we've captured.
It is a big question, and we will discuss this with Europe if we can retain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece or Hungary.
Because Europe treats this as if they are to register, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet there, it may happen that we will not even keep the 1100 in the Czech Republic and they will go back to Germany after they have arrived.
If we can hold them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will handle the asylum procedure with them.
If the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent of European statistics receive international protection.
Then they will receive documents that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up in target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will relocate.
This is the second project that's going on so far, and there we have only progressed in discussing with the churches the possibility that they might be able to help them get a job, accommodation and so on.
But that's a very long run.
You said the other states weren't willing to discuss it at the Minister's meeting with us.
But isn't it just that the Czech Republic is rejecting quotas, but is it offering no solidarity step to unlock the debate?
And what exactly do you think this is supposed to be a solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany says an incentive that all migrants from Syria can join them, the report spreads through all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another migratory wave that goes to Germany because they just don't want to see us.
We think that the path is to protect the external borders - simply to discourage those migratory waves, to help the needy, and to separate the economic migrants.
Unequivocally let them know they don't have a chance.
In the last year alone, fifty thousand Kosovans arrived in Germany.
From the safe Kosovo, where we pay all saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the state attorneys.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them or only accept them according to the needs of the economies, the 50 percent of what social systems spend on them today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day Germany introduced controls, the number of people detained in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's 80, the first day was 12.
How long until the border controls get tighter?
We were afraid of being captured in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We've still got a few hundred open spots in the stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we're holding will be returning to Austria within seven days.
We do it as standard.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, with Hungary it's complicated, and the Greeks - that's a totally unnecessary story.
So where's the break point?
Would it have to be, like, a thousand a day?
I think it might have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days, they're going to run out of capacity so far that crisis plans come up.
Then I agree with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If the situation arises, the government may sit at once and, by one resolution, decide to strengthen the police about the army, let us give the customs administration or the prison service.
The regional variant is an exceptional state that has now declared Hungary in some places?
I don't think it can come to us this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we only have the Schengen border at the airport and only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen in order for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to shift the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
This would affect the Czech Republic very marginally, almost ever.
Slavia has paid off a large part of the debt at the last minute.
He's trying to stop the announcement of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid her debts.
Football players have been able to get their money.
Football Slavia first came to court on Tuesday because of insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after Online Services from the Pacific Samoan Samoa submitted a proposal for it for approximately CZK 20 million.
Advocate Slavie Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzel within hours that she should not declare a bankruptcy over Slavia.
And it has to be said that the arguments have been made.
One of the main arguments was that last week, a new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Jiří Šimána.
Apparently, money came from new owners to the club at the last minute.
This also proves Slavia's statement before Tuesday's trial - the top club sent tens of millions of crowns on Monday, just the day before the hearing in court.
"All things were paid between September 11th and September 15th," said Legal Attorney Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
In particular, Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or Czech backupr Maria Ličko.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losnicke.
On Friday, the club also paid debt fees to the city part of Praha 10.
As a result, only claims contrary to Slavie remain part of the insolvency dispute.
Either the club said that the commitments were not made or that there were legal disputes.
However, we are ready to pay the amount in the event of a loss of these disputes.
"We have the funds in the bank account, which we can document by extracting from the account," said Judge Mládková.
"All that was paid after maturity is paid out," said Mládková, adding that the liabilities were not paid merely for free.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid those debts.
Thereafter all the evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The Judge ordered the continuation of the negotiations on third November.
However, the decision does not fall either at this meeting but only in writing after it.
Medal for the Finns and the Austrians.
FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of invertor welding sources.
The combination of high-tech, hardware and software equipment integrated into modular construction brings benefits and quick return of investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set is always configured according to customer requirements.
From welding of construction steel to welding of special alloys, as well as from welding of rough materials to welding of thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
The incredible amount of welding curves, simple setting and expansion of the welding source enables you to react quickly to changing requirements, which leads to reduced simplicity, to the need to stop the source and to more productive welding.
FastMig X allows welding with top welding processes developed by Kemppi to ensure higher productivity and quality welding.
The time is no longer wasted and there is no waste of material or correcting wrong strife.
Flexibility is ensured, it is less straight, more welding and higher profit.
It's this year's news that premiered in Nitra, where she also won the gold medal.
These honors are very much appreciated as they confirm the exceptionality of the product.
The leading world manufacturers can boast of similar systems, but due to differences in software and parameter management, FastMig X is one of the world's top.
For those who are interested, delivery periods that are around three weeks are also pleasant.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will certainly continue to expand after the Brno fair.
We have been his regular participants for over 20 years, and almost always our business results are better than before, stressing for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of Kemppi in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka went to build it so it didn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says the expert at the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanke got hit safer, says the expert.
Blanka Tunnel complex was able to be built in such a way that there were no two falls of the soil in Stromovec in Prague, claims the production director of Satra, who is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovic.
He said it on Wednesday morning during a journalistic tour of the tunnel.
But he thinks it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
Drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a price-security compromise.
"Tunnel was able to hit safer, but the costs are increasing exponentially," said Butovich.
The conditions in Stromovka were, according to him, the whole time, but the country fell only a few steps from where it began to strike by a safer and more careful method.
"If the measure had been applied 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovich said.
The Blanka Tunnel fell three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was formed in Stromovec, and in 2010 the land fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav Director Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessaryly expensive, said the euro week.
According to the original intention, the construction was to cost CZK 17 billion.
When we add VAT, which has jumped twice during the construction period, you have twenty-seven billion of twenty-one.
When technology, land purchases and engineering, valorization and similar items are added, it's 29 billion, which is no longer that far from 37, said Whitehead
That's what someone ordered and paid for.
iOS 9: How to get new iPhone operating system with new Apple updates
The new operating system can be requested in Settings when you click the "General" tab and select "Software Update" (software updates).

FedEx's mixed gains, reducing the fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported disappointing results over the last quarter and a huge reduction in annual profit forecast due to low freight demand and higher land division costs.
The company also stated that it plans to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
In this period of last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers on holiday.
Company shares dropped by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trade 45 minutes before Wednesday opening.
FedEx states that it expects a profit between $10,40 and $10,90 for a fiscal year that ends next May, which means a decline of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
The analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes in spite of an increase in interest rates on average by 4.9 per cent, which will take place in January. 4, and higher charges for land transport of heavy or large parcels starting in November.
The company stated that it still expects a profit increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher income and growth in online trade.
The Chairman of the Board and the CEO of Fred Smith said that "the company has demonstrated firm performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing and global trade sectors."
The holiday lease plans were announced the day after UPS stated that it was planning to hire 90 000 to 95 000 extra workers, which is about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx won $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts asked by Zacks Investment Research.
The sales increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts questioned by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping, which has led to revenues in its Express Unit stagnated.
But boom online shopping strengthened the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land revenue increased by 29 percent, but the operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The expression unit recorded higher income due to higher base rates, while profit decreased in freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In the pre-market trade, FedEx's shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a fall of 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the 11th of June record.
At its most expected meeting over the years, federal reserve legislators will spend two days this week sitting at 27 feet long Dutch Mahagan table and deciding whether after almost ten years the time has come to increase the key interest rate.
On one end of the central bank ornament, the two-storey meeting room will be the United States wall painting.
The map is a reminder that Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: maximize American employment and keep the prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, members of the Fed have recognised that there is an unwritten third term of office: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be too close to the predictable decision to be notified on Thursday, whether the American economy is ready to start as a standoff from unprecedented stimulus in the form of almost zero short-term on-site interest rates from the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows a robust growth in the economy, recent turbulence in global financial markets could already scare the Fed out of adding to instability by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - even more than just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will in the first place be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economist of the broker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse to not increase the measure, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient justification to keep waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what Fed will do, which in itself is a cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently questioned by Blomberg anticipated an increase in the rate this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% of its chances to increase.
This would point to the decline in the stock market if the Fed would increase the rates only if politicians made a positive fall by promising that I would disregard the further increase.
On Tuesday's industrial average, Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The assembly was triggered by the expectation that the Fed politicians would delay the rates this week calmly, says John Lonski, the Chief Economist in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed now raised their rates," he says.
If the Feds would do that, "they'd have to go to the extremes in their programming statement and hold the hands of the financial markets so they wouldn't panic."
Other experts claimed that raising rates would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed will proceed.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be on the right track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the power of economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that over the spring and early summer, there is a demand for higher rates this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the labour market this year has seen strong growth.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage profits showed signs of lifting.
While inflation continues to be below the central bank's annual target of 2%, Fed politicians argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "is able to cope with higher rates and needs them, given the closeness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics' chief economist.
But financial markets around the world began to reject at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones dropped by up to 16% below its record value in May when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would go down global growth.
The market was somewhat reflected this month and Dow is now losing only almost 10% of the May maximum.
As the political factors of the Fed, the restlessness of the market provides a comprehensive calculation when to start raising the interest rate.
"In the absence of what happened on the financial markets and reports on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening up at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, head of researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and there is almost no data that they can rely on regarding the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The state of health of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision making.
But in fact, Fed became the monetary authority of the whole world.
Central Bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere sign of then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "tast" their monetary expansion on the market, triggered cramps all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely connected, members of the Fed can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but they also advise with other central bankers and experts to be able to read better the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for wealth-management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va, noted this month that "Fed has a history of movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic foundations."
A voter, a member of the creation of the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy, who pushed to raise tariffs, quoted a decision in 199899 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to a reduction of its reference rate by 0.75 percentage point during three sessions " Despite limited identifiable effects on growth in the USA," Lacker said.
A year later, members of the Fed turned the cuts.
The Fed should prefer concerns about financial stability only during the major crisis, as was the market collapse of 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England's Rate Committee.
The latest moaning does not even approach this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of tariff growth because the markets got upset," said Posen, President of the Institute for International Economics Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/storage is the only contact place that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian refreshments, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
Even the automotive part is available if you need some motor oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to go through all the alleys.
If you're hungry for all this shopping, go get some food at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal commercial stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has different destinations.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and a lot of items are sold large.
Mez fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and other.
The expansion of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and bone, even fry it for you if you wish,
The good part of the store is left to the massive freezing section, where you will find frozen leaves, bitter melons and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, freely selling semi-manufacturers and more.
Who here buys: The owners of restaurants and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Wide alleys go out in front of shopping carts and forklifts.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the cashier stand.
Location: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of Chinatown and centers - a few blocks from the Philippines The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot that shares other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highways stays with the old.
The House rejected the speed of 150 km/h.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum authorised speed up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided to accept the Senate's amendment, which rejected the increase in speed.
The amendment to the Land Communications Act will now head for the President.
President Miloš Zeman has already said by the end of April that the law allowing the footpathetic speed would veto.
Dan žok (for YES) was also the transport minister against the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network has not yet been built at such speed.
On Tuesday, before the MPs, he supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved amendment now enables, in accordance with the original government proposal, an increase in speed from 90 km to 110 km/h on selected first class roads, especially four runs.
The House first extended this possibility to motorways on which it would be possible to ride in selected sections at up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused to do so.
The Members have now agreed on his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport of the Amendment, also removed the authority of the traffic police to have the last word when adjusting the local communiqués that the village is concerned about.
The Senate version, approved by the House, is also counting on the possibility that sewers, water pipes or cable public lighting can be stored along length below the surface of the roadways.
The municipalities would have saved money for the purchase of land.
The municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads irrespective of the land owner.
The amendment also aims to help improve road protection and facilitate the handling of towed vehicles by the owners.
Newly, the municipalities may sell towed vehicles which, within six months of notification of the withdrawal, do not apply.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit goods through their territory on the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of fines for shipping companies.
The amendment also cancels the possibility of introducing electronic motorway marks instead of existing paper, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it'll save money for the introduction of the electronic system.
The east esprimator is going to court.
He's been in danger for 10 years for overwhelming the welcome of the aliens.
The case concerns the alleged overtooking project of the Welcome of the Citizens.
The police wanted to prosecute Mrs Zuzana Kail (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not deliver it.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both up to ten years of prison are at risk.
The main trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to the D.A., Mandik and Macík have caused at least one million crowns, resulting in an indictment.
The prosecutor is based on an expert opinion.
The former members of the management of the city, according to the plaintiff, have illegally allowed the company that organised the welcome of the municipalities to gain the property benefit of the company.
Mandik, according to the prosecution of the then chief of the department of city services, education and culture, imposed on him to address five connected companies in the tender procedure.
When another company that offered the lowest price applied to the competition, City Hall cancelled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the administrator and only Darothore applied to the competition, which then the city council assigned the contract.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both charges led to ensure that Darothore was awarded a public contract for the organisation of an event in Ústí nad Labe for a long time and coordinatedly acted at least in conflict with the requirement for the care of a proper host, writes the district attorney.
At the same time, he felt that Darothore was aware that, after receiving this contract, Ústí nad Labem would be billed for the implementation of the welcome of the aliens' price, which would be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years' time, the company recovered more than CZK five million from the project, according to the file.
In the end, the city paid only one share, approximately CZK 1.7 million, then resigned from the contract.
According to expert judgement, the amount paid was at least one million crowns overtaken.
Mandik has already rejected any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this case, the former mayor said that, under his leadership, the city was just following a similar project from past years.
Between 2008 and 2010, Roxy II provided the event.
"It was under the same conditions, with the same money," Mandik added.
The criminals originally wanted to accuse Mrs Kailová, who was also a member of the city council.
The Chamber of Deputies didn't turn her into a prosecution.
Therefore, in her case, the criminals put aside the case, but counting on Kai to charge after her term of office has ended.
The welcome of the aliens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
Hungarian policemen reportedly let a dog on a fugitive.
Then they got the press to delete the footage.
The Hungarian police reportedly arrested a cameraman, AP, at the border with Serbia, and forced him to delete the record of a police dog allegedly knocked down to the country of a fugitive.
However, the Hungarian government is questioning this charge.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia through the corn field near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
The fugitives were under arrest by police officers, and one of them had a certain Syrian attack a dog with a basket on his face.
The dog of the man who screamed "Please, please, I am a fugitive," said Muzi.
Muzi's filming everything, noticed one of the police officers and wouldn't let him leave.
The reporter was no longer allowed to call his superiors, nor his colleagues on the spot.
Muzi's officers took him to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the footage.
The music thus lost the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt threatened because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to the Hungarian Government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács.
She referred to the police as unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and fear that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
Kovacs challenged Muzi's police report on the shooting of events.
He said the cops just wanted the reporter to show them if they were on some footage, which they said they had a right to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him.
"The dogs can bark - they are trained to scare and a little scared, but they did not attack with certainty," says Kovacs.
The unpredictable League of Masters.
The winner of the city will kick us, believe Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we've earned to lose," said Manuel Pellgrini, coach of hometown.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was the classic League of Masters game.
Not one team has created many opportunities, but we've had the ball on the hooves for a long time.
"The cause of defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," said Pellgrini, whose team took in the competition after 636 minutes.
The finalist of the last season Juventus on this was exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian League had only a point as a defenseman and the 2:4 score is only on the 16th place of the table.
That's why the turn of Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will mentally help us, kick us," believes Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistance before the new year - Pirla, Tévez and Vidala.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Manchukic and Morata.
"It's true, this victory is so important, I hope we can find it on the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, especially in the attack phase.
That's what my players deserve.
"At the same time, before our countervailing goal, we were able to collect at 0:2, but Gianluigi held us," praised Coach Allegri goalie Buffalo.
"We burned a few good chances," said Yayu Tourý, City backupr.
We have to take from the League of Masters experience and try for a better outcome next time.
Goodbye Angelo, goodbye old Germany II.
Before we continue on the question of immigrants, we should realize that all the media shivering around is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, there are newspapers and media filled with kids carrying their parents on dirty exodus.
And that makes you feel guilty and compassionate in a person - that is, in a European person.
Well, they don't just come here desperate kids, notice the shots of landing boats to the Greek islands that the kids can't see that much!
Well, we've been missing pictures of ships heading for Lampedus recently from the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenades lay thousands of young men.
Mostly young black men.
And they also disappeared pictures from Callais, where these men eat and black men wait to see if they can walk through a tunnel below La Manche.
I don't think she's getting it anymore.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans have somehow made a special impression on the people of Europe.
It was too much of a fake.
So when it comes to the quotas for refugees, it's somehow secretive that it's not just the unfortunate children of Syria, but also the stable ones - for the elderly: the fashioned - young men.
Whose musculatures look like they just came out of some fitcentre.
Only one personal experience.
This summer for Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on a private beach hotel.
No matter how private she was, a big group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no ham.
And out of them, young black men.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They entered the beach, all their clothes in branded clothes and shoes, in their hands, as otherwise, smartphones.
That this is a private beach, they were not interested and employees - Turks, Muslims! - obviously they were afraid of them.
They've taken all the couches.
Whoever didn't lie on it and was just in the sea, had bad luck.
They were dressed like an American rapper movie.
On the heads of a hat with a nail, white and colorful adidas on its feet.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and began to breed.
They've taken tables around them, stuffed themselves next to the sitting-at-sitting and white guests of the bar – read to Muslims and Europeans without asking questions.
Mothers with children fled from the dining terrace somewhere peacefully.
The incoming blacks drank beer directly from a third - how in US shows? - on the beach they threw empty bottles around each other.
They kept yelling at each other loudly.
It wasn't English, of course.
Then they put themselves in a drink of wine, also directly from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel's swimming pool - in branded swimmers, especially the young ladies - in the water they screamed and screamed, mothers with children and pensioners ran away horribly and in half an hour there was not a single black guest on the beach or in the pool.
Everybody's gone.
No matter whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said half-voice tonight, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everybody had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had a 20-inch massive cross of gold on his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Are these drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen them drink," said the waiter.
They don't smuggle or use drugs.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I knew what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105 it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what would follow.
But secret services and top politicians should've known first.
They don't seem to know.
At that time, about 1.5 million immigrants made their way to Europe.
And they go and go and go.
Today it turned out that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as intellectuals and their linked lobbyist and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now publicly recognized by the main force in Europe - lie, lie, and lie - but not only they, including the tops of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of the Moscow TV of August 1968.
Of course, there were a couple of Sunflowers at the station, but mainly - the ancient German - Muslims welcomed their soukmen.
For weeks, they were babbling on the Czech TV news, as according to some research, the Germans were almost all for the arrival of migrants.
Of course, anyone who's only been in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, the famous research of public opinion organized ARD - Czech Association of Public Law Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of the Germans wanted to accept even more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TVs reported.
However, they kept what broke the next day in Germany: that the poll vote for the article showed that 94.5 percent of the Germans no longer wanted immigrants - the polls were attended by 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel declared publicly in November 2010, that is five years ago, "Our efforts to 'multi-culties' society failed completely."
And then she said, "Germany is giving up the fight for multicultural society."
"All efforts to make such a living have failed in total."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she said that it was not a strategy that allowed people from different cultural environments to live together without being integrated, and today they live with us, and we lied for a while that they would not remain, that one day they would disappear.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say that we just live happily together, has failed this approach.
It's a complete failure.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euro-German Schulz, President of the European Parliament, Member of the SPD, the only one who allegedly does not have even a seniority in the Europarliament - yes, that's the one Berlusconi in the EU said in the Parliament that he could play a concentrator for the next minute - has been shown more than once.
It seems, especially under the impression of recent German politicians, that Germany has exceeded Rubicon.
Note that, except for some European politicians, the majority of European politicians do not support these statements, the state-states of the countries that were victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have spent years trying, at least on the outside, to deal with their horrific past of the aggressor and the killer of millions?
Are they right to say that the devil of aggression, superstition and violence is in the soul of Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped, by all his strength, the attempts of the Grand Germans to dominate the entire center of Europe?
When did he say that the Grand German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he was.
When he was put off, the preparations for World War I began.
The idea of the Grand German, which led Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in another form.
Following an attempt by Marxists to dominate the state, such as the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany, on the basis of ecology, which was by the way one of the main ideological teachings of Naziism, a new German ideology began to develop.
We'd say sunshine.
German elites have long resisted the formation of German nationalism, leaving all those fighters in peace against the atom, lovers looking for paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password Our forest must live.
In order to satisfy restless young people, who everywhere in the world want to do something differently and better, have fully leaned on the side of the warriors against heating the planet, have stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-Semitic - the so-called Propalestinian - and the anti-Slovan current, all of which have been a difficult verb - since the days of Karl Marx, who, after his parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the recent statements of Schulz and the German Minsters show, openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states, the idea of a leader of Germany.
Which must be obeyed without rejection.
Otherwise, you're woeful!
And if we add in that that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
As always, the capital, especially German, is in line with the fact that Germany, through banks and the Union, controls most of Europe's countries.
Pseudovira Sunflowers first introduced the Germans into the swamps of environmentalism and multiculturalism, and today she brought them home and will perhaps bring millions of Muslims.
Who, enticed by sirens' voices, will soon hit a wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see and start to crash.
Germany can only threaten its neighbours once again by force, once again a part of its inhabitants - but it seems that a smaller part - is ideologically lost, but ultimately the reality will catch up with it as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when public protests of the Germans broke out against incoming Islamists?
How will Muslims come to help in Germany for a long time, but certainly not aspilled to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans, are watching their country fear of Islamizing?
What will it do to the Germans, and even with Germany, when people who will raise up loudly and publicly protest against the new euro-overman Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict, which has led to the promotion of solar ideology in Europe, i.e. elite ideologies and essentially totalitarian , and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the infallible conduct toward the disobedient democratic Germans and all the underprivileged and disobedient Eastern neighbours, this cannot be done well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of caught vendors: scare them to death.
Just knock and a robust knock on you will grow in a way that the weaker character may not just stop.
A living head will wipe you out and drive you down with a staunch head, accompanied you on the way away (or rather drive away) by an irresistible dealer and a lively statue.
Maybe it's a shame that a talking knock can't actually be taken.
Even with us, it would be useful to drive away a lot of duvets and bastards.
Courgettes (Oxalis corniculata).
Small weeds that tolerate dry environments.
And so it is among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On 16 September 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is one of the expansional weeds, but it looks like it creates a nice impression regarding flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
She's unquestionable, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a driest environment, is easily adaptable, modest and difficult.
He's making leaves with a chaotic composition, but it's worth watching and taking pictures.
Under the detail there is only the beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompaniment.
The Brazilian paediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey knowledge of the importance of good nutrition to women when breast-sucking children by showing unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the overmining of energy requirements, pregnant women and newly baked mothers are recommended to increase daily calorie income by 500 calories per day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure for mothers to follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic production of their children and protected them from tumour development.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets have been negatively affected by the childhood immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's trying to take over the lead at the Today Show
By Charles Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry to cover the costs of escape from the liberal leadership, it was not possible to create a sufficient increase in assessment for Today.
Nine's early show from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Armstrong has stuck in London as part of a week long series of international television, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that this tyranny of distance to the audiences of Aussie TV matter so much because it recorded on average 397 000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330 000 viewers broadcast today.
Today saw a smaller increase in its assessment compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only last Thursday (343 000).
Today in recent months, he's filled a gap in Sunris.
In August, on average, 318,000 were compared to 330 000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has 349 000 viewers on average and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than just Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!
Today added on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand, has on average very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
The critics wondered if Thomson could pull a TV hit without a Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is clearly yes.
The X Factor from Seven has kept a strong 1.136 million viewers, which smoothly defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL Familias (726 000)
The Seven recorded mixed observations of the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new television quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30), quoted by Andrew O'Keefe, had on average 446,000 viewers.
The second half - hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers — a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia was on average 520,000 viewers and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
Thanks to the fall of The Chase Australia ratings from the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat at 17:30 will eventually win.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a Million Dollar Minute show that couldn't beat McGuir's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may not have found out who would win Bachelor.
The woman that Sam Wood comes up with on Bachelor is shrouded by an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls that stand still will definitely not reveal who's the real one that gets the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before only two left, they cluelessly told us who would win.
Sam Wood holding his tongue till Thursday finale
All three women were singing about why Wood was a perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when you ask, "If not, which gets Wood's final flower?" could their answers work as a linker as to who gets Bachelor's heart.
As Jeavons-Fellows, Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would best fit Wood in addition to them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a light relationship from one day forward.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched Sara's and Sam's energy, I felt that they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really fine woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski said.
I saw them together, and there's the good chemistry between them.
They're fine and enjoyable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood could make a great couple.
She claims, on her own, that during his last visit home, she realized that Wood might be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized this is no longer just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if she didn't, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I like both girls just the same - it's between Snail and Lana inconclusively.
Bachalor is being sent on Wednesday at 7:30 am to Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after he moved to the United States and a lot of teams were questioned after his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some trainers let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which he performed the conversion of the Australian rugbi league in the first excavation of the pitch during the Tuesday win of 20:3 on Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and take him to the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also being honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the newbies in front of the rest of the team, he could cheer them up.
Tomsula also supported Hayne's press conference after the game.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, stated that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his mistake and only take care of another game.
Already in the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne fixed his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured by broadcasting when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian radio duu Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his career in NFL he couldn't even imagine.
“It happens, you just focus on the next game and that’s all,” said Hayne
Hayne compared the trap to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own goal area led to the three of Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published a photograph with fans, on which he held the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Rus Vladimír Putin meet in a discussion about the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Russia's richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested in gun-pointed arms on the Siberian ranch.
After openly questioning President Vladimír Putin, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
The U.S. was replaced by emigrants who sought compensation for property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could no longer be returned, so the couple turned to the State for compensation under the Act on extra-judicial rehabilitation.
The court first granted them the requested amount, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the appeal court changed their claim to grant them only less than CZK 90 000, referring to the fact that the amount of the refund is determined according to the 1991 price rules.
The emigrants were represented by the Supreme Court, and they were struck by the original amount of the defendant.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to the U.S.
In the meantime, there has been a change in the social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the applicable legislation at the time - even if the compensation would be adequate in relation to the property being withdrawn - today it is only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of secondary participants in the restitution of entitled persons who have been exercising their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to grant a refund earlier," explains rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, why the U.S. took the side of the migrants.
"The U.S. has repeatedly said that the general courts should proceed in restitution matters so that possible inconsistencies are not interpreted in the absence of legitimate persons and that the purpose of the restitution legislation is always achieved, i.e. to undo the property wrongs caused by acts of the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA now starring Radka Fišarová.
By the way, Radka Fišarová became the world's youngest Evita when in 1998 she played the role of the wife of Argentinian dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Prague Spiral Theatre.
To return to the same role, he says, "To this day, the demands of Evita did not match much of the performance."
Evita is not just an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended by Monika Absolone to be the first lady of Argentina.
I saw a monster three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspiring to me.
This is where I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I'm quite a fan of more modern modifications, but this one is simply particularly successful.
"The regime of Ondreje Sokola is original, light and current," says Fišarová.
The intentional handover of the musical bar between the two singers will take place at Monica Absalon's Birthday Concert on September 27th from 19 o'clock at the Studio DVA Theatre.
She'll climax with the compositions of Evita's musical tonight.
The experience will certainly include a shared duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
In the limited number of performances, Andrew Sokol will also take off from the director's desk when he will be represented for the film by Karl Roden as President of Perón.
Due to the public interest, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of World Music Evita presents the Studio DVA Theatre in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London has been successful since February 2015.
In the direction of Ondrej Sokola, Monika Absolone studied the main female role.
Karel Roden appears by her side as President Perón and as Che Peter Strenačik.
Legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's workshop with Czech texts by Michael Prostejovský in the live orchestra led by Kryštof Mark, who participated in the first introduction at the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after cops shot rubber projectors at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in South Nepal after the police shot rubber projectors into a crowd of demonstrators against the draft new state constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
There was violence on Tuesday night in Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of the district officer, states that more than 1000 demonstrators were gathered in front of the police station and some were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they resorted to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians have been injured, states.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, known for their ability to kill, were traditionally used as less deadly alternatives, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that they set up a new province under the proposed new constitution and mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in West Nepal were also recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which demands the creation of its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have been killed in violent encounters, including 11 police officers.
when four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial question in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but the legislators has accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake, which killed thousands in April.
The legislators voted this week in Kathmand on the provisions of the draft constitution and officials state that the new Charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We can't panic right now.
After a defeat on the ice of Master Litvínov, you couldn't even handle your home duel with the hockey players Sparta (3:5).
Aren't you worried about entering an extra league like that a year ago?
I hope nothing like that happens again.

NHC predicts a 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide, low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern most Cape Verden islands has a 60 percent chance of developing a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
Another well-defined low pressure system in the middle of Cape Verde and Small Antilles also has 60 percent probability of developing a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added a weather forecast based in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to collect $111 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it launched a campaign aimed at selecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who flooded European states to escape from the wars of fallen and poor countries.
Google announced this on his blog very unusually.
A report on her blog published by Google Rita Masoud on the basis of her personal experience when she fled with her family from Kabul as a seven - year - old.
"We have spent many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter, and fear," Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, there are more and more families, like mine, willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed between four nonprofit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: doctors without borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all contributions made via google.com/refugeerelief up to $5,5 million doubled.
Europe has been facing the greatest wave of refugees since World War II, most of which come from Syria thrown out of a four-year war that just this year has driven 4 million people.
Many people are also fleeing from the war of refuted Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For mild obese diabetes, weight loss surgery may be useful
The benefits of weight loss of surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say whether slightly obese type 2 diabetes people live longer after weight loss surgery than those provided with non-surgical treatment.
"The data on mortality last long to see," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, the expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an introduction to the new JAMA surgery.
The weight loss surgery, bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reduce hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective for type 2 diabetes treatment, but most of the study has been conducted in people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or greater.
BMI, which measures the weight-related relationship, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values of 25 or greater indicate the overweight of the person and people with values above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a study since 2007, which has dealt with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and gastroectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatments in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those undergoing surgery decreased according to study 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, BMI remained the same for those who did not receive surgery for diabetes, approximately the same as for the value of 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the treated group, only 1 percent and part of the patients had a total resolution of about 2 percent for comparison of diabetes.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, trigylcerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol have also been shown "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers also monitored the patient's level of haemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflects the continuous level of blood sugar in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, reports researchers.
After the operation, the mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 percent to approximately 6 percent.
However, in the treated group, this figure remained about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce mortality at five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrointestinal group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater BMI decreases (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and were more likely to remission diabetes (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they have found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone from University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people who had undergone bariatric surgery had about 29 percent more chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study has not shown an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, it is a comforting result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Just here, this work is critical, because it states that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group," he says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after the patient's BMI fall between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to show people the severity of the situation," he says.
I think that once the accumulation of these genetic changes that will firmly link their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to capture all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the near east.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the refugee home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech when opening the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which deals with the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He claimed that in the present circumstances the interest of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, was inadequate for the refugee crisis in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to address the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"A few thousand refugees are wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring true peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
In dealing with the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attack and claimed that "the US's violent reaction caused the chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in President Bush's letter and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent road.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and created unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have had a sanitary agent over the last four years
The toxicology centres around the United States reported an almost 400% increase from 2010 in the number of children to 12 years of age that swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitary agent, according to the Tox screen in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia's toxicology centre, the number of sanitary ingestions in children up to 12 years of age reported to poison control centres increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more frequently and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink the sanitary device intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge to the social media.
The YouTube videos show teens drinking an ambulance due to cheap fuss.
Teenagers were supposed to be mixing oral water with an alcoholic for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the product.
"Children don't think that it might hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot more attractive (sanitants) are those that are perfumed.
Sanitary devices with the smell of strawberries, grep or oranges are very attractive for children.
The ambulance contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few miles may mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is a highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 Station in Kansas City, medical director of a control center at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't just let the whiskey go, either, but people leave the sanitary equipment out, and when they get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ate up to four pounds of ambulance agent with the smell of strawberries and was taken for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Guineanett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke indisputable words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
The doctors were monitoring her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any sign of brain trauma, because the girl fell for alcohol and hit her in the head, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, mother of Nhaijah.
It could've been fatal for my baby.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to make sure that the sanitary equipment is available from within the reach of the children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, certain sanitary devices were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died from swallowing a sanitary device that contained toxic, undeclared ingredients.
Medical officers thought the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in North New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary devices and prohibited their presence in the room.
The police have considered a maimed plan as "innocent talk," referring to a school neighborhood discipline,
Famous: No inconsistencies in the Celtic team
Griffiths has been bugging the stories of the Centuries in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he's going to turn it again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the unity of the team.
Dons raises their lead over Celtic by 5 points
Penalta from the first half of the presentation of ADAM Rooney provided Aberdeen with a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, making Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denys talk about incompatibilities
This situation has caused rumors of inconsistencies in Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates do not work under any pressure from increased surveillance in preparation for the fight with the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we're feeling under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Deficiencies in Scottish title rivalry bore the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Deputy Rangers and former Dutch representatives Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them for the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador to Ajax, says: "They no longer show the best of Celtic games in the Netherlands, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People here don't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the Old Company's games, and not just the people in Scotland are watching these games.
I'll turn things back to good things, make a commitment to Deila.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a little stumbled, but the Norwegian boss committed to turning things back to good.
The defeat of Malm and the subsequent fall from the League of Masters was quickly followed by defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now is bound to the top of the five-point table.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already had a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current situation.
We're on the same page, but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic support because it makes players much better.
Now it's very important to stay together.
Warburton's worried about the January reinforcements.
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and suggested that he had already identified some of his January targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about buying reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former chief of Brentford says, "The January transfer window is very different from that summer."
Players who come in the summer have an entire pre-term period of residence, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding non-necessary players to those you really need.
Celtica Michu's transfer target suggests retirement
The Swansea Mich's attacker, who was linked to Celtic in the switch window, indicated that he could retire after his contract with Swansea had expired.

McInnes says, "There's no team that won anything, be it the cups or the leagues, without winning this kind of game."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged, while the total unemployment of the UK is rising
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged at 164 000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10 000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The rate of Scottish unemployment 5.9 percent was above UK level (5.5 percent) as shown by data from the National Statistics Office (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has decreased by 12,000 over a period of three months, and the number of workers has now stopped at 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland dropped to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a number above the British average of 73.5 percent.
The secretary of the State of Scotland, David Mundell, commented on the latest figures: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year since Scotland has made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we witnessed further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment grew while unemployment fell.
Why I witnessed execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I'm gonna be watching a man die.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison and I'll see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials to witness his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day comes, I'm getting worried about it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to follow executions in America, and because there are often more requests than available seats, a morbid lottery is performed, which will decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will be watching the execution unbiasedly.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to my closest friends, Richard Glossip, and I have created a special bond to him for months of calls and one two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist either, so I won't be allowed a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the breeder as he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "it could formulate better," but she still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who'll be ready to tell a story on the spot.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help with the procedure against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from Huffington Post, will be at my side.
To know more about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here again.
I can't say for sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of complicit in a crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that insufficient evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is bad.
And from this perspective, I'm going to be watching him die.
I can't say I'll be really objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the man I love die of unnecessary death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry after exterminating the Canning River men.
A man from Petrhu who ran away from the police, didn't leave after he got into shallow mudwater just a meter from a cop who tried not to violently persuade him to return to shore.
Canning Vale P.D. was summoned during an incident that went beyond Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"Stand in the water and repeat, I'm not going out, just come get me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use safer tactics and police negotiations."
"Sometimes people try to do funny things when they run away," said Castledine.
The Ben Cousins Football Champion gives a memorable example.
In 2006 Cousins took a car to the ditch to avoid the bus and tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning a biathlon of Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody claims that the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peeter Moody accused the organizer of Racing Victoria that they tried to get a spy in his stable last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He focused on the organizer and integrity department of Racing Victoria and was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with a late scratch on Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidarin's positive embodiment on cobalt, which he can't explain.
He bit his tongue about the espionage charges for 18 months, and he didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight, and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk my head up and the owners think I'm doing the best I can for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Previously Moody released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"Apart from 18 months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I would name after the question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out about the things that are going on in my stables," said Moody at Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in an attempt to catch me completely burned down.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moody, current president of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's a personal matter?
Does the RVL grow a few balls and make people out of coaching positions take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is going to give them the material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will press them, and I will carry the burden on them to make decisions.
I have the support of my family, and I can leave.
The coach's frustration levels have increased with the long-term investigation for cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent scratching in it has made him feel that "he could have his license on the table."
Mood, most famous for the preparation of the undefeated Black Caviar Champion, has identified the rule of treatment on the day of the race as "symptomous" after clay or mud was applied to the leg horses, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally applied mud to his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened.
It happened the day of the race.
Moody faced three months of disqualification for the treatment of linings on the day of the plant to which the organisers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobraman driver who ran away was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist on the weekend in Cobram and left after the collision.
The bike was aired to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after it was hit by a car on the main road Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
The police said that the motorist had left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old from Nathalia confessed to the Shepparton Police.
It is expected that he will be charged with non-stop in the event of an accident, non-assistance of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains stable in the hospital.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns to rivals for wrestling
Craig Bellamy, coach of Melbourne Storm, criticized the actions of his players as "the establishment of a plan" of two NRL favorites of the Prime Ministership.
Trent Robinson, coach of Sydney Roosters, said that the referees allowed Storm players to "rest" his player during the controversial victory of the Storm team in the Sydney finals on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly curved remark on Strorm after his team won the North Queensland Cowboys finale on Saturday night, when he called the game a "surveillance" of the rugby league and two of Queensland were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy resisted the actions of his players and said that during them they focused on "Contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his confidence, because his team is criticized by two head trainers, which may mean that they are afraid of defeat by the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when 242," he said on Wednesday, Bellamy.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and techniques in the past few weeks, we've just put emphasis on contact during the procedure, and that meant a turnover for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and apparently he's been training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could be a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like this always come in this annual part.
Bellamy misjudged Bennet's idea of an upsetting football and reminded his mentor that the Bennet team of St George-Illawarr Dragons won the 2010 Prime Ministership by playing "stupid" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right about the fact that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. Also it was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care at all.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that seems to him to be disturbing, especially his young supporters with their speed.
Such a football game would you like to play if you had this type of player available.
He said that in 2010, and now he wants all the teams to play his football style - but not every team has two backup players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more confident because they say things like that because they're worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big fights.
Bellamy also pointed out that in the Storm and Roosters game more goals than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos team was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game were two more attempts, but is it an exciting football game?
Or are the breaks and not skinning the experiments interesting?
I think it's agendas.
If they mention us, it means we will surely meet again at the stage.
Storm has a break this weekend and they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronull Sharks in the preliminary finals next Saturday night in AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.
A Serbian man has earned a $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilos of cocaine that was smuggled out of Queensland got a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men who was arrested last month by the federal police searching for 100 kilos of drugs from the Solay yacht, who arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomer in August.
Maksovice was seen at a meeting with a joint accused in the harbor during the morning and later met with them at the coffee shop Coomer Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for the possession of commercial cocaine, Maksovice's lawyer has made a defense that there is no evidence that he owned all the amount and that he could be in a cafe entirely by chance and innocent.
Peter Flanagan, the Supreme Court judge, thought the Maksovic had escaped.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of court.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and stepfather Maksovice together offered bail of USD 200,000 for his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of both persons, it is clear that the deposit lodged is USD 200 000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts were clearly insufficient because the accused did not appear to be present in court, he warned.
The maximum security deposit has been granted on condition that he gives up both the Australian and the Serbian passport, daily he will report to the police and will comply with the exit ban from 18 o'clock in the evening to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophil used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then he logged in for her online chat, where he had a lot of rude photos of the children who had sent him another user.
The girl then woke up and found out she was missing her phone and then found it in Hogg's sleeper's hand.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found some disturbing news.
Police were involved and saw five photographs, then analytical computers found the address and discovered "unfortunate" web search using expressions to find immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was to "put the pedophiles on the Internet before he "pretend to pretend to be a police officer and scare them."
Fiscal Deputy Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was addiction - that he was dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he was running the search on the computer, but he claims he was just trying to pretend to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with the unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send others.
He thinks he did it to lure them.
He claims he's lost his temper and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When a girl found a message on her phone, he called her mother, she was shaking and crying.
She saw the immoral images on her phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was questioned and talked about how the defendant used her computer and PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted to the action concerning the admission or granting of inappropriate images to children on 14 June last year, violated the terms of bail on 25 January and did not attend a hearing in court on 24 March of this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the sex offender list because he can argue that his act was not "no fundamental sexual subtext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed his sentence for October for the submission of a report by social workers.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but was held in custody before the hearing on other unresolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual offenders before the date of his sentence.
Zimbabwski Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the African oldest leader, earlier this year he fell on the steps leading to the stage.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in the social media.
Parliament's opening was also defiled with the statements of opposition legislators that they received anonymous threats by killing them against Mr Mugabe's squeal during his speech.
Last month, they whistled him out and provoked him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The President of the Movement Chamber of Democratic Change (MDC), Innovative Gones, said that the seven opposition policies adopted by text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to prevent Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from numbers that don't appear, but it's named 'death'," he told journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and that their parliamentary immunity is not working as soon as it comes out of Parliament.
The Chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has "fear" about threats to Members.
Hewlett-Packard is going to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancellation of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of its efforts to restructuring and save the business costs of business services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two companies quoted on the stock exchange and separates the computer and printer trade from its faster-growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in the range of about $2,7 billion and start in the fourth quarter, says HP.
"These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, Director-General of HP and Chairman of the Board, who will be the head of the unit after distribution.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of shops that will help businesses transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the emerging requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual income of more than $50 billion sent to the company and "will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technological solutions" to companies.
This will be the distribution of the company, which was founded in 1930 by the University of Stanford by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, which produced electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the "environment of Silicon Valley."
HP was undergoing massive reorganisations to manage the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest manufacturer of PCs and one of America's largest technical companies, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a closely specialised company has better results.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta says the teammates have to get behind wounded Jack Wilsher in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilsher that he is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least another four English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next summer European Championship is clearly uncertain.
A shame about this latest problem is that Wilshere ended the last season strong after the ankle injury and then again got into the former form during the fore season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," says Wenger.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he suffered earlier.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula.
The survey performed by Prime Minister Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he had his game debut six years ago.
Over the last five years, he has played only 65 league games of Arsenal from a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for the Arsenal, it means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the enchanted circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you come back after the injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a contest", says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get away with it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will, and he will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal starts campaign in Liza champions at Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to turn his team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to enter.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
“I try to balance and let players who need it breathe out,” says Wenger.
Even though Arsenal is a clear favorite for the F-group, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after last season's "invincible" campaign.
The stadium trembled about Wednesday night by earthquake 3.2 degree Richter.
That was ten years ago in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that the Arsenal learned from the last season of the League of Champions when he capitulated against Monaco and remained far from hoping that the club would lead to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This deployment is huge," says Wenger.
Arsenal never did.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that teaches us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of similar views in different shows is striking, especially given how men need to open up more desperate than ever when it comes to suicide between young men under 15 years.
In 2013, it was the only cause of death in men 20-45 years of age in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (Calm) marked 2015 as the Year of Man, whose aim is to question a culture that prevents men from seeking assistance if necessary.
In the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents a half chance of developing mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, it must, of course, be reached first.
In this communication through social media with emphasis on style and not the content of the communication, the immediate response is often preferred before meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, we have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire recently explained, money doesn't buy much happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series has been the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victim, the moment of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all of the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
as a Samaritan worker explained to me: ..."My role as listener of people who feel depressed or have suicidal inclinations really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying " dealing with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the programs that will arise in my memory when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
It emphasizes little moments in male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the condition of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a greater close, from a network of friends and family.
So if this weekend you are going to FrendsFest organized by Comedy Central Station, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely reworked for the occasion of the celebration.
Or when you see someone alone in the Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know what the difference your friendship can make.
Friends series will be broadcast at Comedy Central Station from start to end - complete 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped the PSG to bury the Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinburgh Cavani after shooting the goal against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored at his debut in Liza Masters and helped PSG beat the Swedish Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the report on the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cavani both scored on Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in Liza Masters with a final comfortable win of 2-0 against Malma at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after his debut in Liza Masters and this PSG player sent French champions after victory, but then threw a few chances, until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored the goal of the head in 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in group A, and that is why Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions, as they do not only focus on qualifying for elimination wheels, but on improving their journey to the quarter finals they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they won three points, it was not the classic performance of the team Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasted in front of the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"In Lize Masters it is not easy to win outside or at home, so win 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and look comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things we will have to improve with the process of the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we didn't shoot one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, who at home gained 2-2 tie this weekend with Bordeaux in Lize 1, but was overshadowed by Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian wing was marked as a man who would move the PSG in Europe to a new level after the transfer from Manchester United, which took place last month, and showed why, when he ran for the Marco Verratti Pass behind Malm's defense and by a beautiful ending, he sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to start a spectacular PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs and got into this phase, entered with 9 internationals in the base lineup and five defenders and two drawn backuprs were a heavy opponent.
But besides Nikola Djurdjice's missile, which just missed Kevin Trapp's far corner in 34 minutes, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves sought out the benefits of the attack with bad passes and a lousy ending, which was not good even from Ibrahimovice, which could not fire five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his missile arrived in the net shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he turned out to be much more appropriate when he came to the preparation of the odds for his teammates and it was just from his pass when Di Maria sent a turning missile that ended up in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of the game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan head sent behind the line already the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic scored him after the pass from Maxwell's left wing.
This ended all of Malm's thoughts on the possibility that they could extract anything from the game, and only the fine operation of Wiland from a great proximity had put an end to David Luiz's hope, and the score remained unchanged even when Ezequiel Lavezzi's alternate goal was unrecognizable at the end of the match.
Malmo Age Hareide's team coach admitted later that the PSG were a class higher than his team, norr said: "Our last game in Lize Masters took place last December."
Since then, we've only played the Swedish League, which is not on the same level.
Qualification matches aren't enough.
Hat down for Paris.
It was a wonderful game for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for selling shares
The Glencore mining giant, based in Switzerland, which was hit by a commodity price collapse, earned $2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of shares under its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in its statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to repay the debt.
This company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with commodity price reduction, as China's economic slowdown is reducing demand and fuelling the sparks of destruction across markets.
The problem of the law sent Glencore's stock prices to the top of London's stock market in early morning stores.
The shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent above.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion is part of a wider plan to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which accumulated by about a third.
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 pence per share, which marked a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
So they got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns regarding the extension of China’s growth decreased the cost of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, confirming the White House in his Tuesday report.
The first visit of President Xi to Washington will take place on 25 September in response to Barack Obama to visit Beijing, where the president visited in November, presented a report.
The American President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner that will take place after the interview.
"Visiting President Xi is an opportunity to strengthen relations between the US and China and encourages cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the differences between the two states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the UN September.
Obama and Xi are expected to deal with the disputed problems, including Washington's concern for the alleged cyberspyping of China and its increasing aggression in the South China Sea waters.
How the refugee crisis shattered the Schengen area.
The emergency light set off by Germany has far removed the European crew, but is already forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
On Monday, the European Union decided to address the refugee problem first: it will be more systematic to classify migrants and asylum seekers as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece, than to argue for the future distribution of refugees by quota - on the basis of quantities which are becoming increasingly decommissioned by reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 out of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160 000 refugees, the ministers of the Member States’ internal ministers changed their priorities.
Before taking care of the final destination of runners, it is first necessary to filter those who arrive today and to solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," emphasises the text of the Minister's debate on Monday in Brussels.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds it at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increase its pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in this country.
Central power makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, even with varying intensity.
Hungary has taken this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permitted under the Schengen rules.
That it's a dominal effect, but it sees the blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy, and also in Hungary for those who have already gone inland.
The French Home Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière were intensely discussing this during their private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is implemented from a stiff point of view.
In Italy, according to non-official statistics, two-thirds of the newcomers have been registered and identified with fingerprints being taken.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that there should be camps on its backs in which refugees will collect on its account.
Greece remains the real black hole.
On its islands near the Turkish coast, more than 200,000 people landed this year, twice as much as they have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after they passed the crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge eating hole.
Athens, who are still in financial dissolution and who are waiting for a new government, have put their hands in the lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkans's journey and the source of today's joint concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises that the establishment of control points will take place as soon as possible, but it did not mention any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," the EU Interior Ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise this front.
It is therefore about deploying the European border control agency's teams in this country to the European border control agency Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece extend its capacity for the reception of asylum seekers and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"The need will be adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to the Ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The question of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching.
The new emergency situation of the 28-year-olds has, as a second step, pushed the issue of binding quotas and 160 000 refugees, which has been set up by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year, strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the obligation, was preserved on Monday in the text approved by the majority of the 28-year-olds.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the trial is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which has already been agreed in June during the EU Hectic Summit, is concluded by Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed the avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, German nationality is also a woman who survived as the only one affected by the eight - member group.
Previous news from the media said it was about Poland.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a severe leg injury in the femur area.
The dead were mostly 40s, according to AFP.
"The rescue was over, and the victims' bodies were transferred to Briancon," said the prefect of the department of Hautes-Alpes Pierre Besnard.
The disaster happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the top of Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 metres wide and about a meter tall," said the chief of rescue workers Nicolas Colombani.
According to the eight - member group, an enormous amount of snow was collapsing at an altitude of about 3900 metres.
Weather service today has not warned in the area of bad weather.
Trupisovský before the Brago match: Finally, a true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpisovský, at his premiere in the Cups, managed to pass the European League forefront to the basic group, and now he is looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
Sloven will welcome the 2011 finalist to the start of the main stage of the competition, and according to her coach she wants to force her game style.
After all the nerves in the elimination fights, where every goal and every situation could have knocked you out on the way to a dream group, now we're there and we're playing six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal we've taken, we can play our tactics and we're not tied to just double.
"I look forward to it and it is a true Europe, before it was only a qualification," said Trpišovský at the press conference.
Bragu considers the team top.
It will be very active, have themselves Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be more difficult than not having that name, but he has three goals in his cast that I suspect Manchester gave him.
"It is an excellent whole at the level of the top teams," said Trpišovský.
But Bragu does not consider it clear.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we also showed in our home competition and in the pre-schools that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost from eleven duels this season only the opening Supercup in Pilsen.
They believe that Liberec can force Braze into its style.
We'll have a team that's gonna be strong on the ball, but at the same time, it's, like, unusually disciplined for them.
They play from the distribution of 4-4-2 with a fast transition to the attack phase.
"He's a very hard opponent, we've discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing is how our players will do it on the field," said Trpišovský.
We studied a lot in front of each other, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted to the trainings.
"And we certainly want, although it will be very difficult to play according to our notes," added the coach.
Student films take over Písek, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries have entered their works in the 15th edition of the International Student Film Festival in Písek this year.
Four tens of them, composed of students and teachers, will be screened from October 15 to 18 at the Portyč Cinema.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said the spokesperson of the festival Jakub Charvát.
Every year, the festival has its special theme, which is derived from the festival song.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year's festival evenings Richard Blumenfeld is planning to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And, of course, we also need to solve the crime that was committed in this year's enmity," Charvat said.
Visitors will see the choice of the most interesting of student works - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, which will, for example, meet the winner of the previous year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Shard.
Festival organizers like every year are preparing an accompanying programme.
The Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer of Ondøej Ruml, professional player of Didgeridoo Ondøej Smeykal, turbošanson group Poletem?, play band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with recital Life at the bar.
The festival will host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first will bring a graduate of the sand film school and the holder of prestigious awards, including from World Press Photo 2014, Jan Ašenbrenner.
The second exhibition will bring closer the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber with his music and the song natives Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of the statue of Jan Novotný will baptize his new book with 3 friends from town P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron of the FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are its legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to gather here, exchange experiences among themselves, and develop joint ties and film works," the spokesperson said.
The Pitching Forum will help to do this, where students can meet with film professionals, take several job auditions at the same time and get a job.
The festival is connected with the creation of a private university film studio in Písek.
Her founders, the husbands of Vladan and Miloň Terč, organized their first year in 1997.
The sixth year was held every two years.
In the event of a bankruptcy of CC, insurance undertakings shall pay their client's claims in full.
Insurance undertakings should pay the client’s claims in full when the travel agency fails.
She decided on the Wednesday of the House when she approved the revised amendment of the Law on the Terms of Business in Tourism.
Travellers will be able to replace the insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee, according to the template, which is intended to be assessed at the Senate.
Insurance undertakings with an obligation to pay client's claims and above the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development insists on adaptation, arguing with consumer protection.
The insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel agencies against bankruptcy when the amendment will apply.
However, travel agencies also criticize the proposal.
Because without insurance, they're either gonna have to quit or go abroad.
Ms Karla Šlechtová, Minister for Local Development, pointed out that the cases where insurance companies had not paid their full compensation were not Eurocomform.
It noted this year's decision by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund, regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance undertakings will receive sufficient information on the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, stressed Šlechtová.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have a limit to be feasible," said Vice-President of TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
He thinks the bank guarantee won't work because no one's going to give it unlimited.
"Cestage offices will have to end their business or move abroad," warn Kalousek.
Member of the Presidency of the Association of Czech Travellers and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) did not agree with Kalousk concerns on the basis of a survey between Member States.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance," he said.
The expression of insurance undertakings does not consider Okamura relevant, there is no official written expression in this sense.
They say they will find out if travel agents will participate, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jan Fischerová (ODS) also warned about the provision, which referred to the opinion of the Competitive Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague, Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of stairs to Czech travel agencies.
Travel agencies according to Fischer will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," says Fischer.
Her proposal to launch the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Nor did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) come with the proposal to return the draft to the committee due to alleged contradiction with the Civil Code.
Philip warned of travel agencies that he thought could put consumers at risk.
The rapporteur for the draft of Martin Berdych (ANO), in the light of the judgment of the Constitutional Court, withdrew her proposal which would limit the liability of the insurance undertakings in cases where they could not know that insurance payments would not cover the full risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum of four million insurance limits for travel agents offering air transport trips and a million-dollar limit for offices selling bus tours.
The border will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales of tours.
However, the insurance provision limit will have to be such that, in the event of a crash, the travel agency will cover all customer claims.
The standard and after adjustments provide that the travel agencies will have to indicate on the tours sold, which travel agency organizes the tour.
Travellers will have to submit data on the economy and number of tours to insurance companies before concluding the contract.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee includes further regular information on insurance undertakings.
Travellers will have to provide them with data on the number of passengers and trips sold each month, the total price of the tours sold, the amount of the advances and the sales for and the vouchers for the tours.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to fulfil one of its legal obligations towards the insurance company, it shall, in accordance with the formulae or may prohibit it from concluding new contracts in the event that a breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of customers.
The amendment is also intended to modify the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the mountain service subsidy on the basis of its application, which will always be applied by the end of April for the following year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, the financial plan of expenditure and the outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the lawmaker did not figure out what would happen if the insurance company terminated the CC contract.
She won't be able to organize tours, and the clients who bought the trip before the insurance notice will lose it, according to the association.
In such a case, the CCA will suffer a significant loss and may also fail, even though its management was in good condition.
One option for travel agents to cope with such situations will be to sue the State.
Another option will be to move abroad and make use of much softer conditions abroad and then on our market we will act only as agencies, said the vice-president of the association Jan Papež.
Although the amendment's proposal also includes the bank guarantee institution, it is unthinkably impossible to implement it at all in practice, as the bank guarantee cannot sound unrestricted.
Moreover, according to the association, the change in existing practice is de facto unnecessary.
In the two-year period, the entire law will have to be reworked in view of the new EU Directive.
On the Czech market now operate a total of 942 active insured travel agencies.
Only three CCs have ceased their activities this year.
The domestic travel agencies will sell annual tours worth approximately CZK 20 billion.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must base itself on improving humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of runners to Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced this after talking to German prime ministers.
At the same time, it again called for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU to be among the Member States of the 28-year-olds.
We need to help countries where refugees leave, or where they stay after they leave their country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we are looking for dignified conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which there could also be greater financial assistance or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations.
"The Federal countries also support the German Government to promote a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis on the European country," Merkel further said.
In this context, Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woidke, said at the press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU countries.
The distribution of EU runners on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also called for an accelerated asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to begin faster with the integration of foreigners, said the Prime Minister of Berlin.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of runners should serve to integrate those who have a chance to gain asylum.
More teachers will be needed to handle German.
It is a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if runners manage to integrate, they can benefit us, he said.

Tweet gained more than 5000 retweets and 4000 liqueurs since he was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of the social debate.

In February, the singer Prince made a hint of the movement, whereas he listed nominated in the Album of the Year category during the awarding of the Grammy Awards.
"Alba are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.

"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," said the manager.
Damon was recently reported on a list of entertainers, producers and media may have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the display of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation, or has already met the Pope, it is not clear.

“I certainly did not imagine such a start,” Hughes said, “but during the third shift I felt I was able to pitch better.”
After resisting the first shift, Hughes released one point to the second metastasis Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right field of J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez out, who was the first to run all the finishes.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.

Xi calls for opening the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to strengthen growth, said President Xi Jinping, whose task is to reform governance on Tuesday.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," he said regarding the 16th meeting of the Central Head of the Group to deepen the overall reform.
The promotion of opening up in future reforms will provide new impetus and vitality, and will also provide a new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The Head of the Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border control policies, the support of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of a resident registration system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is significant as it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, it states.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and ensure that companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In order to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened up by private investment.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with better services," says the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or for a "green card", thanks to the optimization of requirements and simplification of the application process.
The provision of lawyers' rights to practice and develop a professional judge and prosecutor was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and the leaders of Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary Region there may be a new unit of beds.
According to the Deputy Director of the Karlovy Vary Region of Jakub Wawek (ČSSD), the current capacity of the bedroom departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region should be done on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
But there are options to extend care in the region.
For example, in the surgical department, day-to-day surgery centres could be created, where, according to the established concept, surgical fields would be performed, which do not require hospitalisation for more than 24 hours.
In which specific hospitals should work on day-to-day surgery, it is not yet clear.
In the skin department of Karlovy Vary hospital could again create a laser centre with the possibility of using laser techniques for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic center to care for patients with brain impairment who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be set up centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also a possibility of focusing such a facility on the hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region, is the following-care beds, in particular the long-term treatment (LDN) bed, whose capacity in the Nezdko region is insufficient and should, above all, be closely linked to the beds of acute care.
Part of this facility should function as beds of rehabilitation and part as a classic LDN bed, recommended by the concept.
As he points out, beds after care are missing mainly in Karlovy Vary Hospital.
There you could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary Region, social health beds are not focused on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
There is a shortage of these beds throughout the Republic, so it could also serve for other regions as the Alzheimer's Centre.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of the so-called follow-up beds to which European subsidies will be released.
"It is beds that will follow up to the areas of extraspecialised care and will form space for translation of patients after surgery, for example, after cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplant or other procedures," describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
