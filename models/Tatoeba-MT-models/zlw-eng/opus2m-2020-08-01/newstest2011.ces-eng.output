ČSSD doesn't know Voldemort or the confectionery in Prague
The new City Hall Councillors from ČSSD seem to have to overcome a certain language barrier to understand their old colleagues from ODS at the Prague Council and at the Council.
The daily News.cz members of the new board from ČSSD "tested" as they know the notoriously established slang, which was established at the town hall during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which the Prague political smetrana introduced during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and case in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new councilmans don't understand familiar concepts.
At least that's what he says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a novice in Prague politics," he responded to the "Kostrovský" language test of councillor for the culture of Lukáš Kaucký.
Although it is a political veteran, he also responded to Councilman Karel Březin.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you're presenting to me that I sometimes use."
"I don't generally recognize another slang."
From the dictionary, whose expressions the daily Aktuálna.cz published in June before the ODS election congress, the editor chose six examples, mainly those which are notoriously associated with Prague's Magistrate.
The Socialists were to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the confectionery", "the bull neck", "the ghost of the capital" and "paint".
The three councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to be in charge of Prague education in the future - the first to promise to interview, later he did not answer the phone.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, said no to the test.
"I don't deal with these things at all, and I'm not going to evaluate how the civil Democrats are having fun."
"I am now dealing with how we will understand within our programmes," he responded.
As it has already been said, Councilman Lukáš Kaucký would not have known in the title above that he is speaking about an influential entrepreneur and a friend of the expressor Bém Roman Janošek.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucki, and the only term he correctly estimated in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky, and he adds, "But I know it from the paper."
"I'm gonna have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf course is then deciphered as Blanka’s tunnel not only by the matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for the environment Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort is, and Lukáš Plachém is familiar with where to find this character - know the meaning of the term "go to the confectionery" .
"I mean to go to some Prague business," Plachy is close to deciphering that it's the headquarters of Januškov's companies.
Consistent with Březina, he recalls that he learned more from the newspapers than that he used such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the frequency test, there is no similar dictionary of slang terms.
"I had a good time with my colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like this."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes shorts and comoleins of names are used," says the chairman of Prague's ČSSD, Petr Hulínský, who is called Hulda.
"At school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," admits Karel Březina's own nickname.
The diary has tried and works.
Councilman Weinert is Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, representative of Miroslav Poche, who, before the election, has pointed out fraud in party sponsoring, has a nickname "Igračka" in some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing that social Democrats admit in intra-partic talk.
He says Hulský doesn't like to hear Hulda, but he also recorded another nickname of this Prague chairman.
"Dr. Bumpy Law" says he recalls that Petr Hulínský won his title at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of the witch, published a brochure
The women declared in Burkina Faso have several common characters.
Rather, they belong to the older generation, they cannot join in the work for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
The one who becomes witch is sent to isolation, not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Men's fate will rarely come."
"The young healthy women don't move away because they help to work and give birth to children," describes the orderly sister who is in the capital of the West African state, Burkina Faso, an old in a special house of over a hundred women who have banished their communities from their ranks.
The local government has now decided to intervene against an unusual "social measure".
She published an information brochure to help limit the witch hunt.
It's got a catch, though.
"More than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso can't read," he pointed out to the disadvantage of written education in the Die Standard.
Charging is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, two hundred and seventy - year - old Ammy Hemmaho died last week after she was tortured by three women and two men, and they swallowed it with kerosene and burned.
The BBC server informed about the case.
The perpetrators claim it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, an oil that is used for ritual anointing was lit.
He was said to have floated after the group wanted to "outrun an evil spirit" from a woman.
The isolation of witches supports people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 21-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The eaters of human souls have always presented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the witch hunt is trying to ease the government, the president himself participated in Gambia last year.
"Gambian President Jammí, after his aunt's death, started an extensive witch hunt, which was supposed to have been involved in her death and tried to kill the president himself with black magic."
"He called on shamans from nearby Guinea, who were violently taken away by selected men and women from the Gambini village to the president's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, trapped people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and renal problems.
They didn't survive two incarcerations on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand were released into freedom.
Bakal's tenant: Tops in stoves, higher rents signed
The older grounded man stepped out of the door of the client center of the company RPG Flats "uhlobaron" Zdeňka Bakala, the largest private owner of rent apartments in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with a new lease for three dwellings: his daughter and his son, who is in the execution of the punishment.
All three have just been deregulation raised by rent.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay 2+1 for the second category of CZK 4100 from next year.
"And it is not warm water and it has to be petram (a stone for solid fuel, note red)," says a man with a finger in his son's new contract, whose signature is full of power.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half-resisted.
The citizens' association of BytyOKD.cz, which has called new rental terms "irregular and immoral," advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until 7 December when they publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But a man only has a wave of hands over it.
"One says it, the other it," he blinks.
Ostrava becomes a large laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, there is a large majority of apartments that still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic.
Currently.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laborator" personally.
The Havířov waiting room RPG is one of a total of four in Ostrava and on Tuesday morning it is already full.
There's a security guard standing right next to the door from the security agency with a trigger device.
"Five 2011" lights a special button on its touch screen.
One tap and the machine goes out with a number.
You can't even read "157" and your number is already beeping on a large screen below the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're up in half a second.
After a while, he comes to ask the older married couple, but apparently no new rental is involved in the waiting room.
Most people have come to solve common problems as usual - repair applications, insurance events and so on.
Letters with new leases in Ostrava receive most of the 44 000 apartments in the portfolio of RPG from about mid-November to the post office boxes.
RPG Flats in letters proposes an increase of between 15 and 38 percent.
The special bulkhead for new rents was opened at the client center on November 18.
"It's going on for over a week, so it's just in the run," the employee says, "after a while, when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining flats are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, he was taken loudly by the Vice-President of Parliament and the Ostrava native Lubomír Zaoralek from ČSSD, and even now the local newspapers are full of him.
"Twenty years I want a new floor after them."
"Neither they changed the board in the toilet," the man mentioned at the outset is relieved.
The most so far according to the workers come pensioners to see if they get a discount on rent if they sign on time as RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half of the discount on February rent will also be paid to other tenants who will sign the new contract by December 15.
The Havířov "deregulation" bulkhead, but the questions are definitely not absorbed.
"From last year's 360 clients, due to the rental for 2011, there were only about 40 to 50 people," they estimate the employee behind the counter.
On the web and its boardboards RPG proposes individual contractual arrangements where necessary.
However, if both parties fail to agree on the rent, they will have to be appointed by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about only a possible and fully legitimate legal procedure," points out RPG on its website.
"There will be no trial here," says one of the workers RPG Flats and the man on the street before the client center gives it partly for the truth.
"I have a 13,000 pension and I have five grand left to eat, and I have no reason to judge," he says.
The worker, however, at times, only at times.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek is telling them not to sign in the media, so they're probably waiting for people," he thinks.
Rent regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with New Year 2011 and according to RPG Flats there is an increase in economic necessity.
"The current rent still does not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Flats, that the depreciation of the housing fund, is the main reason for the increase in rents, according to home owners.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010 RPGs could invest four billion from rents, in four years from 2011 to 2014, it would be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the polated seats of the Havířov waiting room so far repeats several red-marked information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31 200 apartments, that's more than 90% of apartments RPG."
"And it will always be about CZK 7.50 per square meter and a month," he appears on screen.
Only for 400 flats from the RPG portfolio, the rent will be increased by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square metre," warns RPG.
2600 apartments will remain the same next year's rent.
RPG Beings promises that deregulation will not remove rents jump, but will be spread out in four to eight years.
In addition, he adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) will put the company back in flats, mainly in thermal savings - new windows and warming.
They're supposed to get them first by people who sign the lease increase agreement.
The offices include kindergarten, understood by architects
The Avriopoint administration building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would expect that he also hides a mini school with everything that belongs to it - with colored walls, creative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature outdoor terrace playground.
Since October last year, children of Arch.Design employees may visit her.
The project-architectonic company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important Brno buildings, calculated the space for its business mini-school from the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs almost 90 people mostly in the age of babyboom and it was up to women designers and architects to get back to work quickly.
Together with the possibility of short-term work, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers its employees under the social programme.
Stawers and architects thus have the opportunity to combine demanding work with caring for the child.
The Minischool invented its own staff of the Arch.Design and managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs with the support of the management.
The company's mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the Czech Republic's state budget.
Thanks to grant funding (a grant of CZK 2,8 million) they could purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified personnel and operations for two years.
After the exhaustion of the financial subsidy (2 years), Arch.Design has the obligation to operate a mini-school at its own costs for 3 years.
The project was prepared for one year and Economy Rating helped significantly with the grant application.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the care of children is taken care of by the nurse and the teacher of the school, so children can go to kindergarten without age limitation, yet most of them are older than 3 years.
Because it is a "mini-school", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more can be replaced during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of the position in the company.
Although this is individual education and care, the programme supplement in mini-school is comparable to the pre-school education framework programme.
Children play here not only, but also provide quality teaching - from basic knowledge to training to school benches, English is also taught.
Class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and avoid stress situations with delay in picking up children from kindergartens away from their parents’ workplace.
Parents use working time more productively.
No wonder the employee's naturally loyal relationship is created here.
Arch.Design has become a member of Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and have strengthened personnel marketing through this program.
The bone house is even fascinating after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a right-wing lizard, a stairwell resembles the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are open to the fish mouth.
This is the Casa Batlló house in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From locals, thanks to his organic shapes, he earned a nickname for the House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, façade resembling scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house plays out dream lines, tender colors and textures that resemble nature and animals.
During the detailed observation, you can see geometricity, rhythm and precisely thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, it is lit up so that the impression of the shine of colors is still strong.
The quilting and twisting of shapes is also found in the interior.
The tree in the waves copies the window frames, rails, decorative elements of the door, cuckoo and rails.
The Batlló House, which stands in the Eixample district on the busy Passeig de Grácia 43 shopping street, was rebuilt by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese in 1877.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing an old building and building a completely new one, but soon he accepted Gaudí's idea for an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The Casa Batlló Chinahouse but Antoni Gaudí did not design himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol cooperated with him.
It was on his design board that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the owner of the property as well as the use of the mosaic on the facade.
Many other artists and artists also worked on the facade.
Joint work on the proposals of Casa Batlló has started a successful cooperation of Juiola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá house and the Güell Park, where there are other works of Gaudí.
From locals, the house immediately to completion earned the nickname "The House of Bones" thanks to its organic shapes.
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening windows, began to call it the "gathering house".
It is also said that at the top of the building, the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia, is similar.
The hidden religious motifs also contain other sculpture elements of the building.
Gaudí do house designed for his time a unique central heating system with vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem their 40-degree slope.
In the work of Gaud, he did not respect the building regulations at that time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the building, though he obtained a building permit from the city, the above data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, the city council was reinstated and asked for a remedy.
For example, the council did not mind that the construction involved the pillars and the public pavement.
There has never been a correction, on the contrary: only 15 days after the call of the city part, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent two top floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon and on the third floor of the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented by the jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is intertwined by a stairwell that can be built up to the roof terrace itself.
The basic elements of the reconstruction were the removal of all right angles and direct lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be completely interconnected with the opening of the living room door and the larger society can communicate comfortably without preserving the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facade, Gaudí's house also gained an unconventional roofing and two extra floors.
Gaudí's play with light, blue and white glazed tiles is also impressive, which includes an inner yard and lights.
The game of two colors provides maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply to bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs sun rays on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló house, which was assigned to the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and precious apartment made available to the public.
The owners decided for this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the hundred and fifty anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They insisted on the tour as they found that it was a very advantageous business and, in addition, the tours spread over common and subterranean spaces, including roof terraces.
The entrance to the monument is certainly not negligible, it amounts to EUR 16.50 and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The sum is well above the price of entry into other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you need to make friends with one of the residents of the apartment and visit him right at home.
How to choose mattresses and grates: Women have different requirements than men
Not the homing frame of the bed, but the quality of the beds, i.e. mattresses and grates, give the basis of a really good bed.
However, they must be complementary in order to suit a particular user.
When choosing, he decides a lot of things, ranging from weight, height, age, health and the sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which mattresses and grates are purchased.
A typical example?
For example, the weekend cottages, where they don't drown regularly, are not suitable latex mattresses because they slow down "heat up".
In addition, they have significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
In so doing, it is necessary to rotate them regularly.
If they don't have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they're still lying on a solid plate, they're holding moisture: there could also be mold below them.
The custom also decides when choosing.
Anyone who has spent longer time abroad, where a very high mattress with a softening layer is often used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
"I think all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they wouldn't sleep here."
"On their broken shoulders, heels and hips, they needed a mattress with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"This is also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they mistaking "information" from their joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamchiková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hokeers, but also other customers, were looking for a mattress with lazy foam years ago.
"Today it's cool, the suitable mattress has for example Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL boy to appreciate lazy foam.
This "sight" works easy.
Optimises its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
There's nothing pushing you, you're not going to turn around like you're having a tough fight at night.
You're just gonna sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against the beds.
When selecting the size of a mattress, add a foot length to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in a double bed, which is 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example, for singles, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back you should have your hands comfortably slightly shrunk in the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, a feature of the Cech of upholstery and decorators, who has devoted themselves to the issue of healthy sleeping and ergonomics of furniture for many years and has presented it at the vocational schools.
For a double bed, every one needs its own grate and mattresses, but here beware when purchasing to adjust the heights of mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing other than putting grates in different heights, but it does not have to happen for each frame of bed.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the shapeing and turret layer.
"When touching a hand or sitting on a mattress, you must not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Full-seamed beds, where mattresses and bases are like grown siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are bad, their covers cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat in the night, it is clear that after five to seven years of mattresses, one large (and clogged) sieve will begin to resembling.
Therefore, experts refuse advertising slogans for mattress life for up to 25 years or even life guarantees.
But everything has its own.
Therefore, the advice from the sellers: for mattresses with a width of 120 cm or 140 cm of hygiene and work, do not give up the detectable coating, but rather add a mattress guard that can be easily removed and washed.
Even though the covers of mattresses are commonly produced today, all over the circuit, so that after the opening we get two parts (for washing and washing size very important!), however, the manipulation of larger types (and at one person) could be a reminder of the battle of light scales in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a board in your bed instead of a grate?
Never!
Maximum bed for one night visits.
However, you will provide the board (if it does not already have it) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring bone and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (with it).Taschenfederkern) and a turret layer.
Polyurethane mattresses don't belong on that basis.
For non-silver lavender with 14 to 18 lameles, suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (for example a combination of latex and coconut), but you can always pay for grates with more lamel, 28 or more, where lameles in the bed area are doubled and can be regulated by their fat.
The positioning lamel grate does not include a spring bone mattress, because they do not react to the positioning.
In addition to setting the rigid lamel, the so-called shoulder cradle can also be enjoyed.
It's a special fixation that allows you to push, or even bend alamela so that your shoulder sleeps "slip".
For men who have "arms over their backs", it's definitely an important thing.
Even the producers of mattresses, who began to use a softening zone in the area of their shoulders, remember it.
Women also remember - they give softer surfaces to them in places of hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed for wings or board grates with so-called multitorsal feathers.
The pressure is distributed to more points and the voltage is reduced.
However, as soon as you use the right mattress and grate the wrong pillow (big and "inflated"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and tip only interfere with the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
50 x 60 cm are recommended as suitable size, which is preferred in Scandinavia for example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be evened (with the shoulder column of the grate or softened zone in the mattress) with the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with original straws filled with grass.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least straits.
There's just a trend in bio mattresses.
Oil raw materials produced from polyurethane foam are substituted with natural oils, such as jump and soya.
Soybean is now being used by all known producers.
"Bio at mattresses means that the core is made of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsules to relax the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There is a division for men and women.
While a man "cools" a plant extract from the birch to absorb heat from the mattress and cools the body, to women the covers of "heats".
The extract from red peppers increases blood circulation, making it weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
The mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cell structure, it is more breathtaking than regular polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
By combining various rigid cold foams and "line" foams, multi-zone mattresses are created, which know exactly where the head, back and heel are supposed to be.
You will pay seven thousand crowns for high quality mattresses.
Those who meet health parameters have a lower VAT rate are taken as health aids.
He was the first to reach this advantage in the Czech Republic, Gumotex.
Saving on mattresses and grate is not easy.
Sometimes it is possible to use actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with a full memory foam Memory for 11 990 crowns.
The second can be purchased free of charge.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density launched Tempur's "cosmic" pace material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA, because astronauts were exposed to enormous overload at the launch.
The temperature in the heat is soft, on the other hand, it is hardened in the cold.
The heat of the human body adapts perfectly and spreads its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of beds, but also to increase comfort while sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for medical products, for special pillows under the feet that lighten the leg and venous system.
For example, domestic producers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and so on.
People want more and more parents to watch, so they want to keep their children alive.
Fear of your own child brings more and more people into the idea of GPS care.
The system originally created for the search for cars can also monitor the movement of people and thus help, for example, in cases such as the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anika Janatková.
The device is about as big as a matchbox so far, soon but it can only be as big as a watch.
A number of people spooked the case of the missing Anička and began to feed on the means to protect their children better.
Even at the price of disturbing their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not a spy, but another means to reduce the likelihood of some tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of monitoring equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases such devices may be used, for example, when they are put in a bag by someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't met this case yet."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," said Pilin.
According to him, the child should always know the purpose of the box and how it is used in an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková warns that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like that, he'll just get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose some things if they don't want to be under control."
"The big expectations were earlier triggered by cell phones for parents, but they can be switched off as well as these tracking devices," says Bočková.
According to her, it is also disputed whether it would actually help such a device in the event of an attack.
"When it comes to a planned kidnapping, the offender will practically always make sure that the child does not have any electronics to reveal his location."
"Now it's a phone."
"When the tracking devices begin to expand, they will also be looking for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by a massive advertisement."
"In that case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says a psychologist.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech, RC Monitoring, which offers monitoring services for both cars and people, even if the monitoring device is destroyed immediately, his presence can help.
"The arrangement can be set to send the position regularly after a certain period of time."
"If any damage occurs, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The more expensive devices also have colonometers built-in, so even if a person slips and stays motionlessly lying, the device will immediately send a warning with the indication of the position," says the Czech Republic.
According to him, smart mobile phones with navigation can also be used for recording special software.
The problem of current tracking units is that they are either devices similar to the sizes of matchboxes or smaller mobile phones.
They're always at risk of losing them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, therefore, it is now testing devices that look like a normal digital watch.
"This will have the greatest advantage in knowing that a possible aggressor may not recognize a tracking device at all."
"Or do they know them after a while and it can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking devices develop into bracelets or trailers, they will still be using the same technology as they are used to watch cars.
This is a combination of GPS tracking (which use common auto navigation) and mobile phone functions that report the current position of the car.
The army has a cord that it would tangle the Czech Republic, but it will only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of ropes that set off explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence has added 224 kilometres of rope to the warehouses.
The military has a supply of 225 years.
The problem is the durability of the cord is two or four years at most.
The army bought the cords from the STV Group, a. s. for CZK 40 million.
In order to justify the purchase of such a huge amount of MF DNES, the General Staff wrote that soldiers use 60 kilometers of lighters a year in training.
However, it follows from the calculations of military bomb squads that the DNES MF addressed, that all generals, military command officers, secretaries, and cleaners would have to undergo a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
The Minister of Defense Alexander Vondra and the commander of the army Vlastimil Pick do not matter.
Only then would the military’s annual consumption be justified by 60 kilometers of arson.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, military supplies would have been enough for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it would be sufficient to train each new professional at least two metres of hotlines, as experts say, the army has secured fresh purchases - even with increased consumption of genian or special units - supplies on mentioned 225 years.
The soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no bullets to their handguns, so shootings are also limited due to the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It also doesn't take my head to buy so many lighters from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and I'm sure they know what they're up to."
"For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we are trying as merchants," says STV Group manager Jan Děcký.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometres of lines bought even by the military having supplies of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from STV Group only talks about the four-year life of the measles and police or military bomb squad even for two years.
"When it's perfect storage, it could be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, doesn't want to publish his name because of the military's criticism.
After life, each munitions must be carefully tested whether it is yet reliable and does not threaten soldiers to live.
But these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry is a quantitative discount of 445 kilometres of ignition.
"We were 60 percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty miles," interpreter Pejsek said.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of bomb squads of police bomb squads that destroy ammunition from World War II or the Soviet army, has not been in excess of 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police are always ordering just enough to use this ammo before the lifetime is over.
It was proven to be a good thing for the safety of the bomb squad, and it can also be more flexible to get more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence is already having considerable difficulties in the destruction of tens of thousands of tons of ammo from the days of the Warsaw Treaty, when the Czechoslovakian Army prepared to go to the Rhine.
According to the Czech bomb squad, which the IMF DNES has addressed, the same problem awaits in a few years: it will destroy hundreds of kilometres of old incinerators, which today "lacino" is buying.
To this day I draw from the contacts that I gained thanks to the competition
The winning place in the Živnostník of the Year helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec became the winner of last year's Živnostník of the Year.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And he realized in a foreign country that Liberec lacks quality accommodation at reasonable prices.
From savings from foreign brigades and using a bank loan, he bought a semi-decomposited house with five apartments.
For a third grade student back then, that was a lot of courage.
"The then ratio between quality and price of accommodation in our house did not give me anything to do," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to rent to foreign workers.
All the profits he invested back into the house, which gradually converted into a guest house with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years of business he gradually opened four guesthouses in Liberec, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently a four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, another quality added to it.
"We've just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrove near Tisá, where we sold our franchiseing concept and other interested in the franchise of Pytloun hotels," says last year's tradesman number one.
"And on this sale license to operate the hotel was very much involved in the victory in the Živnostník of the Year competition," he admits.
The victory brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me extra, and I must say it was pleasant," she recalls.
Participation in the competition definitely recommends to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win, any visibility is good.
He says he's still drawing on contacts and connections he might not have gotten to.
"I started to trade regularly with some of the contests I met."
The glory associated with success, according to him, came to a bit for every employee.
And he's got 'em around 70s.
"I see greater loyalty and pride in their participation in something that has gained general recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had in Farmet.
Euphoria from victory quickly changed the impact of the crisis.
However, thanks to the winner's purpose, Farmet has worse times in progress.
For the prize for the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Company of the year, the owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský came to his place last year in Slovanské House.
The jury then appreciated the efforts that it built from a small tool shop in the Czech Skalica company with a hundred million turnover.
"I can say that the award encouraged not only me, but all my colleagues and increased our confidence in the fight against competition," says the winner of last year.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered to father Karl Žďárský to rent a small workshop as compensation for the communists' seized property, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in the company where he worked, and with his friends they set up a company for plastic baths with his dad.
Soon thereafter they began to specialize in foxes of vegetable oil.
After 18 years, they became the largest producer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among the non-professional public came to the firm after success in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers began to notice the brand Farmet significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they were working with a company that had achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, he was not only in the sign of euphoria of victory in Farmet.
The valuation was based on the company’s economic results by 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And just in 2009, it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering goods.
The crisis has peaked, which has not yet touched citizens, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and have begun to limit purchases of new machinery and technology.
"This situation, of course, has not avoided us either."
"The sales dropped by 40 percent, we had to limit the production and let it go," explains Karel Žďárský.
A living company has to be able to sometimes take such unpopular measures.
But they managed the situation and kept the company in profit, although less than before the crisis.
However, what they did not discount in Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We have built a research and training centre with subsidies, we have strengthened the presentation at international fairs, we have received the main awards in home exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The sales are growing again and the number of new employees with them.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," said Karel Žďárský.
A Web site that removes nonsense
The desire for the year is the fourth part of the business worship.
Some senseless regulations have already been repealed.
An unfamiliar winner of the next year's Absurdita poll has become an obligation to carry documents that are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the four thousand voters decided to do so.
For example, social security administration required a paper extract from the business register, even if an official can get it with two mouse clicks.
It'll change thanks to the poll.
"Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register of Insurancepayers' checks," said the spokesperson, ČSZ Jana Buraňová.
To shine on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and these senseless cancels are the meaning of the Absurdita Year competition.
This year is the fourth part of the farm newspaper's business worship, and among the public, it is becoming increasingly popular.
If there were about 3,000 voters in the vote last year, there were almost four thousand of them this year.
And there is no wonder, a variety of legal obligations that serve only to delay business is still enough and enough.
"We are at the top of the world in the number of lejsters for tax returns," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurship in recent years has become the declared objective of all governments.
However, compared to the world, the situation does not improve particularly in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, in terms of business conditions, the Czech Republic has placed at 74th position, which is eight places worse than last year.
Absurdita of the year was first declared in 2006 and is held annually according to the same scenario.
An administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can be logged in every year from April to the end of September when the competition is closed.
The website address www.firmarocu.cz Then the organizer will select seven candidates for "anticene" and let the public vote on it during October at www.firmarocu.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Absurdita that gets the most votes wins.
This year's survey has been filed more than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations missing meaning.
The tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by trade unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, there was a requirement among the nominees that cars to maintain motorways and speed roads should pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets should paint every two years.
This year's list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which regularly participates in political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, President of the Czech Chamber of Economics, assisted by Eva Svobodová.
"The economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws businesses under their feet, so it is my goal to cancel every year at least three tens of paragraphs, which today only make business unnecessary," Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade, said.
Trying to break a senseless order doesn't sound empty.
In 2007, the company’s obligation to report three days forward to the Trade Office was most affected by the need for a permanent establishment, an exhibition stand or a pilgrimage.
This obligation has been removed by the amendment of the trade law.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was declared the office of employment for its foreign employee in the range of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called green card law.
And to the third of all good.
Absurdite in 2009 has become a regulation for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two weightings in the office.
This year, the Department of Health decree was eased - the obligation to have a refrigerator has passed.
New category appreciates socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are evaluated.
This year, the fifth year of the Competition of Economic Newspapers is the category called Responsible Company of 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the proclamator and guarantor of the competition as well as in the competition for the rebel of the year.
By this year's first year of this special sub-category of the main competition Vodafone Company of the year 2010, companies for which there is no success in the business of the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would publish a separate article.
Although the object of one of the two activities is diametrically different, aid and consideration can be considered as common denominators for their efforts.
In one case, for example, it concerns people with disabilities and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
For example, a Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who participate in a number of tournaments in various sports, took part in the finalists.
Another example of the company responsible from the Pardubicky Region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor for 17 years of the foundation fund of the sponsoring hendipated children.
The Poděbrad paper room, which has more than 70 percent of them, is responsible for its disabled employees, and has thus won the title of Responsible companies of the Central Bohemian Region and in the Vodafone Company of the Year was placed in the region as a third.
In Olomouc, the company MiRyz Soft won, which introduced a flexible working time, even reduced to an average of 35 hours a week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded the title for buying from Czech producers, supporting civil activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our businesses and administrations have as little environmental impact as possible," explains Miluš Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústecky Region is thinking about the health of its employees and has provided them with ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each notebook, supporting their work from home and using catering services provided by the local protected workshop at their corporate events.
"In addition, we support the Human Foundation in distress, which is helping the local Roma community in particular," says the representative of the company Ondrej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Praní and cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their employees in the form of superstandard bonuses in their pension provision.
"We are giving food, transport, higher qualifications and recreation to us again," says Josef Strapač from the Brno construction company Time, winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year were automatically registered to the category of the Responsible Company of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
The wrong or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were then eliminated by the organiser from the evaluation.
"If the competitors' representatives did not answer questions, they could not participate in the competition Responsible Company of the Year, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year."
"A separate entry into this competition is not possible because it is a sub-category of the main competition Company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, police arrested in a competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, anti-corruption police arrested the last few days.
Iron detectives set up a local businessman in the media sector and a businessman with real estate Luboshi G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public competition to settle the restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition is given a specific interest.
Luboshi G. was supposed to pay half a million crowns for this.
"In the meantime, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for a misdemeanor in public procurement and in a competition," said the President of the Plzeň State Office's Law, Antonie Zelena, saying that further details with regard to the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
Sixty-year-old businessmen were released after 24 hours.
With regard to the minimum of official information, there is only speculation on how the competition could have influenced the public.
The spokesperson of the Lubomír Černá Land Fund, at the request of the Law, stated that policemen actually arrested during the competition at the separated workplace in Pilsen.
"It was about a client, not our employee," she said.
According to the Public Competition, the right name is "Call for the offer of claims to transfer land under the Land Act" and takes place where more legitimate applicants are interested in the offered land.
"These persons in the call offer higher value to their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of the acquirers shall be determined and the Land Fund shall then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the spokesperson of the Fund explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information who applied for the call, and because he himself is also a legitimate person, because he bought a number of restitution claims, he offered the interested parties the property that he would not participate in the competition.
Apparently, he was withdrawing his cleavage.
That would explain he had so much money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had more than standard contacts with PF in Pilsen already in the past.
He was involved in the case of former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing land in the replacement restitution, which had already been decided on the location of the building.
That's when Luboš G. received land from the fund, for example, for the construction of public communications, namely in the place where the arrival bus was to be built into the industrial zone Borská pole.
Later, it was very conveniently converted with a bus station for a house in the historic centre of the city, which had valued much higher.
The town hall had to take it then, otherwise, by blocking the land, it would have compromised the construction.
Residential housing benefits hundreds of a month
From January, households will have to pay for not only all kinds of energy, but also water and rolling, the supply of heat, and where to rent.
So families will have to pull more than one hundred crowns a month from January.
Electricity will travel up to 4.6 per cent, gas will be about 2 per cent more expensive, until you have to pay a tenth for the supply of water in some cities, and many times will also increase the supply of central heat.
Electricity recovery should be a year for households in flats to go out with a hundred-coron of gravity than now.
Power prices have all been reduced by the main suppliers, so there is a significant increase in the promotion of renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaics.
Although the gas will heal slightly, at a time when people are the most drowning and have the highest consumption.
So they must also count on hundreds of crowns each year.
While electricity and gas travels all over the Republic, the change in central heating prices differs from place to place.
Increases in prices are planned mainly by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about CZK 50 a month from January for central heating, with more than CZK 1000 a year paying for families in Liberec.
On the other hand, Prague’s residents are at risk that more than 9 percent of the city’s rents will be increased by water and rolling.
If the rent doesn't change, they'll pay 6.8 percent to the Roasted.
However, the price in Prague will still be in the whole-public comparison between the lower one.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, it has a watery and concise irritation of 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices may rise significantly in 450 000 rental apartments, where regulation ends from January.
For example, CPI Apartments, which owns around 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase rent by up to 100 percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new lease are going to put the company in court.
Regulated rents, which people in approximately 300 000 apartments pay, could increase by up to 10% next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is fashioned, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks that are usually left in the care of a doctor who has not been drunk for 15 years.
The exception is not children who have been treated repeatedly from monkeys in the hospital.
This comes from the experience of physicians who encounter similar cases in hospital wards' incomes.
"Some beers or wines are completely inconvenient because it takes you long to get drunk with them."
"Trend is certainly hard alcohol," said Ludek Pelikán, the primary of the children's department of Hospital Hořovice in Central Bohemia.
"If they can get a bottle of that bottle out of their dad's closet, it's about whiskey, but it's all over the fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of pouring it into its juice and not feeling so much of it," the chief explained.
And the spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital, Motol Eva Jurin, gives him the truth.
"Most often it's fernet or rum."
"This is the modern alcohol particularly at primary schools today."
"In some cases it was the slivovice that they brought from home," Jurinová said.
According to Prime Minister Pelican, there are 13 or 14 - year - old drunks on hospital income quite a common phenomenon.
In front of Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he has worked for ten years on paediatrics in Motola, where ambulances binddered schoolers from a wide area.
"One girl was in our house about four times."
"She started her career at twelve years when they brought her to us with 3.5 millilitres of alcohol in the blood in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at a show in Holesovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that her mother didn't find it odd that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the chief surprised him.
It is not the interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drink their own offspring that is considered to be the main cause of increasing child drunkenness.
However, addiction in the right sense is not possible for children to be spoken of by experts.
"The term alcoholic means a multi-year chronic alcohol addiction with all the phenomena that belong to it, and that's not in children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is a rather significant lack of family-social background," explained Prime Minister Pelikán.
According to spokesperson, Jurin's paediatric clinic in Motole was hospitalized by approximately 40 drunk children by mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication that must have remained in the hospital will enter the statistics.
Child drunkards who, after the outpatient treatment, take their parents home or bring them home by the police don't count.
In addition to having children sit down after school and drink a bottle of shells, there are three seasonal fluctuations according to Pelican that can be relied on: witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"That's either they're drinking grief from the wrong testimony or they're celebrating the start of the holiday."
"I have experienced seven child drunks all at once on the witch," said Pelikán.
The monkey who spends the night with detoxication under the supervision of physicians is paradoxically at the advantage of the one who has suffered an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
In fact, the morning headache caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will cause flooding infusions with glucose and nutrients that are missing.
"They're actually better off because they've had a good night's experience and nothing hurts."
"Only they are confused about where they are" admitted Pelikán, saying that sometimes they spoil patients' pleasant mood at least by counting the costs they have incurred.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will also be worth tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used it as an upbringing tool at times when I was counting on the children's visions how much their drunkenness was and that they could also spend all summer on the brigade to earn the one party," Pelikán added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not proceed to regression procedures in which after parents would enforce treatment costs in cases of child drunks.
Two L-159 aircraft are in Spanish for the first time in foreign hands
Two L-159 aircraft of the total five units for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft on Tuesday, flew to Sevilla, Spain, where the plane manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time that machines of this type appeared owned by someone other than the Czech Army.
In the foreign world, they have only been on exercises or demonstrations.
It is a two-digit version of the L-159T1 which still operated by the Czech army and which were aerospace.
The remaining three machines are single L-159.
They are so far being reserved in Aer Vodochody and the trade broker - Omnipol - took over last week.
According to Jan Pejšek, when the aircraft are physically dispatched from Vodochod, it is not known yet from the press department of defence.
"The L-159 aircraft for exchange were excluded from long-term aircraft, without further deposits and investments by the Ministry's Ministry's Ministry."
"Two-digit L-159T1 has been changed in the current state and form," said Pejšek Law.
He added that the army would not be left without two aircraft, because the Ministry in May 2009 signed a contract with Aer Vodochody worth 200 million crowns for the reconstruction of four unnecessary machines L-159 for two two-digit machines.
One new aircraft took over the army in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejsek, the EADS has committed to beaming planes into the arms of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the customer of L-159 aircraft is EADS and will serve to train pilots from NATO."
"There is therefore the matter of the customer how he will implement this matter," Pejšek said.
The business newspaper said some time ago that, for example, the Spanish army about L-159 was not interested.
The exchange of five L-159 for one plane Casa and the purchase of another three aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved by the government of Mirk Topolánek last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not write on the purchase of the tender and addressed directly to the EADS.
The defenses then argued that the exchange would support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army has bought 72 machines from Aera and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft will probably have a court-martial.
The European Commission was sued by the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court because it was intended to choose aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender rather than by addressing one producer.
The army has already taken over three planes of Casa, the last one should arrive at the Kbely Airport in Prague within 14 days.
Longer pointer than a ring marks a lower risk of cancer
Men with index marks longer than a ring finger are at a lower risk of being sick by prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion of the study published by the British Cancer Magazine on Wednesday.
It may be related to the level of male testosterone hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under the age of 60," said the co-author of the study by Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The breast could thus help to identify who men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, provided Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 prostate cancer patients and at the same time over 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had an index finger on the right hand than a ring finger.
She was paying the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
However, for those who had an indicator longer than a ring, this risk decreased by 33 percent for men to 60, it was even 87 percent for men.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers - formed in the prenatal period - seems to reflect the different levels of sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Recent research has shown that testosterone is the one that promotes increased prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes for the CTK said that he knew of this study continuously, but he said that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer was "fully proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and pavements are mostly driven snow, roaders in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89. and 93. km in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of freight and passenger cars and is also standing at Brno in the direction of Prague.
News told the dispatcher of the Central Motor Club (UAMK).
There was a truck crash on the 91 km, two trucks collided for 93 km, and the accident required an injury.
Several cars have also ended up in the ditch.
The problems are also on highway D1 to 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two lorries collided there.
Drivers should drive just outside Brno on 190 km or ride over Brno and then ride 182 km in Kyvalka.
There's a few-mile-meter column there.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway right on arrival in Prague.
In Prague there is a multi-inch layer of snow, thermometers show negative seven degrees Fahrenheit.
Car colons are formed for example on Prosek, and Štěrboholská is also clogged.
The most secure means of transport is the subway.
Tramvaje drives late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and the Square of Peace.
At 8 a.m., the Prague Crisis Team is to be reinstated.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech railways had to cancel seven speed connections because of the snow.
For example, the problem has a line from Prague to Kralub or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně was closed from Wednesday 11 o'clock at night to 5 am.
Most roads in South Moravia are already downhill, but only with increased caution.
In Vyškovsk there are three side roads, in Brno the places are made up of snow languages and in Blanensko they are necessary to overcome some of the communications in the above places of snow chains.
The most affected places were Vyškovsko.
There are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milesovice.
They're going to have to wear a haircut until they're stretched.
When they are cleared, it is not yet possible to estimate.
Caution in the area of White Carpathians is required in Hodoninland.
On the roads, which are kept there for nature protection only by an inert spray, lies up to a five-inch layer of snow, said ČTK.
From two to ten centimeters of snow in the Czech Republic, the most fallen in the northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region about 15 centimeters of snow came in.
The snowfall in the Czech Republic gradually stops.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army has set up a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the code name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
A new weapon is like a small superstitious cannon.
Because her projectiles run a laser with accuracy over a few meters.
Special charges of 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing a high explosive explosive, actually function as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only when impacting the target, but at any point in their ballistic pathways.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind some obstacle, behind a wall or in a ditch.
It is usually not protected from above, and when the murderous rain of steel shards endures, it can remove it from the fight.
According to Richard Audet, who was involved in the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first gun for infantry that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier essentially treats it by finding the target, sends a laser beam, which determines the distance, so he gets a precise point of intent, adjusts the meter and squeezes the trigger."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"If you pull the trigger, the gun will charge and launch a missile at a distance of 543 meters plus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs will be transferred
Fujitsu will move his branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their post in July next year from the existing administration building at Marienbader-town in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As he told the giant in the field on Wednesday, specializing in computers and their maintenance, he moved 400 men and women from the previous administrative building on Marienbader-městí in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year, which is a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in Frankfurt, called Niederrad.
According to the spokesperson of Fujet, there should be, in due course, a further 100 jobs of the group, which are yet to be divided in the region.
The rental offer was said to be very attractive and the large space office in Astro Park is said to be more suited to the working method of staff.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only in rent.
The competent executive Bernd Wagner said, "We found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure in Frankfurt-Nederrad."
Excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important business within the region brought joy to the winners yesterday and disappointment to the losers.
The manager of the economic referent in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this has succeeded in getting a "global player".
I hear it's a "fantastic expression of confidence in this locality".
Fujitsu is said to fit in with the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korvisi (Greening), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed in good time by the management of the company of its intention.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
However, friends' contacts could not change the troubles of the computer manufacturer with the realtor of the property at Marienbader-městí.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now this is to prevent a long vacancy at such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The house on Rathaus-městí, which has so far been used by Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" belonged with other buildings on Marienbader-městí, to the most discussed construction projects of the spa town.
Between the station and the town hall was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer called city entree, which was also criticized because of the massive construction of the areas that previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001 a company of investment advice and credit rating Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and a producer of Fujitsu's computers, which was still associated with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid after a year.
Fujitsu-concern from Tokyo is referred to as the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers, for example, computer and server companies available and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhine and Mohan region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu's employees are in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions, another subsidiary in this location, will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building Astro Park it was rented for this purpose 7000 square meters.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the starry plan, which is twenty years old, is also located among other parts of the central association of electrical and electronic industries.
Amazon turns off the server - threats against Assangem
Wikileaks is getting close.
Amazon Internet Service has turned off the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this took place on the political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic deficits.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, US prominent Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is led by the list sought by Interpol, is to be delayed according to one newspaper contribution in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the activists told Twitter on Wednesday (local time) to publish short news.
A short time ago, Amazon's Internet company downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic depots to handle a large number of documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained to this step: "Fine - our dollars are now spent by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, "then they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using its Wikileaks servers after Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers had made a search, published CNN TV stations on the basis of information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate House Defence Committee threatened by Amazon boycott, informed the British Guardian.
"I wish that Amazon had taken this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," the Senator said.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for a platform in other countries to prevent the use of servers.
"Wikileaks act illegally, obnoxiously and carelessly and thus our national security is exposed to dangers and threatens life on the whole planet," said one of the statements of an impartial senator.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should help Wikileaks expand stolen material in their efforts."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
According to a report in London's "The Independent" newspaper, 39-year-old Australian in the UK is being held back, Scotland Yard is also known for its exact location.
The Internet activist has always referred to an investigation in Sweden as an intrigue to his opponents.
spokesman Wikileaks Kristin Hrfnsson in London said there were also threats.
"Eventually, the calls for the murder of Julian Assang."
That's why Assange is rightly worried about his safety, said Hrfnsson.
Therefore the founder Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrfnsson apparently responded to the statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked the former Republican governor of Arkansas, to be responsible for publishing Wikileaks for treason and execution.
In Canada, one advisor to government leader Stephen Harper said on television - apparently ironic, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use "target aircraft".
Meanwhile, there was a verbal shootout between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, spokesperson, called it "conspiracy and absurd" that Assange asked the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Hillary Clinton to resign if she was responsible for recently published espionage challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not exactly sure why we're interested in one person's opinion with websites," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than his website."
The U.S. government is now in an extensive search of the security of its databases.
The Deputy Director of the Centre for Antiterrorism, Russell Travers, has been appointed as Special Agent.
Travers became responsible for the development of "necessary reforms in the structure" which are necessary after the publication of messages from the embassy on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to explore ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should get in danger of publishing on Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said spokesperson Philip Crowley of the Foreign Office.
"We are prepared to protect them if necessary."
University of Ice Cream
At Gelato University in Bologna, ice-cream confectioners are being prepared for a better season of the year.
The basic course for future ice creammakers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where's the ice cream coming from?
From Gelatere and Gelataio.
Gelatere, Czech a bit obsolete ice creamman, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio removes ice cream from the cooling box, wipes it into the wafer and sells it.
To find out this, you don't have to go to Anzol dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But who wants to learn even more about ice cream will not avoid the Italian company Carpigiani's "Gelato-University".
In 2003, a manufacturer of ice cream machines set up an ice cream university to make ice cream from his machines fit all over the high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
There are also special courses for chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream shop.
Someone wants a new career in Midlife-Crisis, others go to the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves to move Slow-Food and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industry Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One male from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian woman in Julia's household arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
The Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training at the southern and patriotic cherry on the cake: "The Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a significant dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then they turn on the machine with a tap and leak pasteurized white base cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice creams.
The professor is immediately covered with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can you experiment on your own?
Luciano's warning me to be taken by the spirit of time to the unknown.
Who talks about ice cream "only of natural ingredients", probably also used stabilisers - mostly natural product such as guar flour made of guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilisers, but they must be sold during one day, otherwise they collide and the customer eats all ice grains.
Certain variations in basic matter are holidays.
It'll be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes with the taste of ice cream according to ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit section or in the candy section.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The suppliers will try to force you on a lot of aromatic ingredients."
"You should be simply experimenting."
Be with the fruit sorbet with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or ice cream from white base matter that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa to the basis for allyed chocolate temptation.
Now they're taking the course for ice cream machines.
Luciano always lets them produce four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and ice creams - either with or without eggs in basic matter, with more or less vanilla aromas or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will also be carried out with fruit ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruity puree - given the taste it is not always better.
Nutmeg ice cream doesn't have to taste more peanuts when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream will produce a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when a balanced mixture raises the correct taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerous task: If peach pure with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Extra sugar is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano removes the apparatus to determine the sugar content of the fruit (the vines measure must from the grapes).
Fortunately, tables ease numbers.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as it used to be.
It does not only help the machine to produce basic matter automatically.
There is also a device that simultaneously washes into cream and cools to a minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will soil himself and also his colleagues from top to bottom with fruity puree when he gets out of control by a huge mixer.
"In each course," said Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time when something like this happens."
Double-light revisioners
Efsa's European Food Authority is linked to an industry that is experimenting with genetic plants.
This charge has now been made by a group of experts in Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute to estimate the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we did document it well," said the chief of Testbiotech Christoph Then on Wednesday at Munich.
Head of the Efsa Group of Experts for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts have had a contract with the Ilsi lobbyist union for several years.
It is financed by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated decisively in the control regulations of Efsa for genetic plants and thus stood in a clear conflict of interest, criticising Then.
Efsa's rules are said to be consistent with Ilsa's documents in all paragraphs and thus bear a copy of the industry which should be checked by the Italian Parliament's office.
It's the second time Testbiotech has pointed out that there's a conflict of interest.
Recently, a high-level manager from Efsa had passed without additions or transitional time to the Swiss agrarian group Syngent - thus changing the parties.
The Central Germany radio (MDR) has recently revealed the EU-EU Office's personnel link to the industrial lobby, which has raised interest both the Ministry of the Environment and the Members of the EU.
In the meantime, Efsa can't recognize a conflict of interest.
He works with all serious data, including those from industry, if they are of high quality, is mentioned in one statement.
Experts working for Efs are not required to have contact with the industry.
They have to be documented.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It is referred to itself as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - among other things, to assess the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that at present there are genetically changed plants in animals without any attempt to feed, and that genetic plant reactions to environmental impacts are not tested.
"We want to know what a genetically changed corn will do in the field," says Then.
Current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If there are no risks, how would it be possible to find them?" He asks Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The researcher has been studying the genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the University of Technology in Zurich.
In this area industry, as in the US, is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe as well.
That is why there are almost no scientists who would not be linked to the companies.
Most studies that are critical to companies are not published.
"The industry controls security research," said Hilbeck.
Track of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing outside the Stuttgart station, tubing on his back.
She was a demonstration.
It's snowing.
The story is well known: In September the swamps arrived and began to tear a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, billion-dollar reduction of the station.
When the construction stopped, most of the wings were in the wreckage.
It's broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The limestone from Crailsheim, the soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured several of these pieces.
"These stones are a relic."
"He can't disappear."
It reads, "The hard and poor stone, the simple and the original."
When he cut one, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What's he gonna do with those pieces he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
So is Uli Gsell.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen to the former French army ammo depository, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all of them that occurred during the crash in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they broke apart on a gravel or disappeared on a depository", he says in his office, a wooden booth that was a house that was previously a watchman.
He tells us that he was being cursed and threatened when in September all the papers said he bought the remains of the northern wing from a company that was running the demolishion.
But he's been talking to S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he wasn't responsible for the destruction at all.
And now that it's happening, it's the most reasonable thing to do with the stones.
Then they took about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 pounds heavy block, price for piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also hope to return it when it is re-enacted.
Rongen bought 500 tons, cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest of it's been sold.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They came from every corner and pulled out what was in the trunk and the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long turned into "salts" or as the edges of the beds with herbs.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political plug."
He's getting into his field car and he's going for a ride in his 20 hectares kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted study, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
And a stone lover.
It's got 40,000 tons of stones in it.
He appreciates his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest businessman with old stones in the Republic.
He's shivering.
In the snow lies artistically worked sandstone.
"One of them belonged on the Marien Bridge in Dresden," he says.
The sandstone from the Elbe, yellow, warm, is thrilled.
"My favorite stone."
We're on our way up through the woods.
Point to the pile: red sandstone, earlier part of Karlsruhe station.
Come on.
"Nice travertine."
Once they belonged to the Neckarstadion Tribune in Stuttgart.
There are rocks and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, red garnet from the Sankt Blasien temple, tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What kind of work, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how they used to hand-broken stones and move through simple pulleys and bull wagons, he becomes a total honorable one.
"It would be a scandal if something like this got crushed."
He didn't become rich, very rich at all.
A stone dealer today employs 14 people and in addition, stoners, one statuer, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says one who evaluates the remains.
He must go to Cologne in due time.
There will also be stones to save.
Fighting talent for high-potentials
There's a lot of people at the refreshments.
16 students are pushing at breads with salmon, tomato soups and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the engineering and design students to the workshop.
Together with the developers of VW here they are to talk about the car of the future - and just, by the way, to meet Volkswagen.
Many companies try to race for the smartest heads, like VW, to succeed and bet on co-operation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible recruiting the most gifted graduates in the audiences, before they get to the labour market and will be interested in others.
Since universities do not issue any lists of the successes of their students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in practical projects and to obtain them.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive company tries to get the talents the next day.
A young lady from the department is handing out pens, rubber teddy bears and VW logos.
He tells hopeful young people about programs for practice, student jobs, and shows them the way to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with the VW.
They see advantages for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and get experience."
"The VW can meet students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would be useful as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is he's fighting so openly for the students.
"Otherwise, he was more of a professional project," said Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors companies can no longer choose their employees from long crowds of candidates.
On the contrary, they must strive and try to attract particularly highly qualified workforce.
In particular, graduates of engineering have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the VDI Union of German engineers, 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI predictions, the so-called engineering shortage will grow.
Roman Dykta is a talent hunter for the audit and consultancy firm KPMG.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company is planning to send eight promising US students next year.
Participants can also see KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
Before that, he will decide on two rounds who will take part.
Only Crème de la Crème will fly from many interested parties to the USA.
In the fight for High Potentials at universities they will apply more and more laws according to the Dictionary.
"We want to distinguish with our Race from the others."
"The one-leaf trip to the sailboat was too little for us."
Seems like Dicta's talent hunter is lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants in a similar event last year."
"Some will soon complete their study and plan to apply for a job with us," he says.
In addition to direct contact on campus, small and medium-sized companies are presented in the labour markets.
"We're trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"As for example at Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, head of personnel department of solar technology producer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1,500 employees in Germany.
Sübe knows the issue with young workers.
Currently 35 positions are posted on the company's website.
"Now it's just complicated to take seats."
"It's a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, e.g. Freiberg University.
"Professors inform us that it is possible for us to do practice or write a diploma thesis."
Solar specialist does not organize any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Big companies are often unable to offer it", says the head of the personal department of Stübe.
Money has long not played a major role in searching for work.
Flexible working hours, child care or good procedures are other crucial factors.
Solarworld took over one study at the Great Place Institute to Work 55. place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, co-workers are asked how satisfied they are with their work and the working environment and follow the staff framework.
The head of the personal department of Stübe hopes to bring her points of interest to work.
"I believe that interested parties are particularly informed about the external evaluations of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through his own employees", he says.
This is called Internal Employer Branding, i.e. the establishment of an employer on the market within its own employees.
"The satisfied employees are the best emissaries."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise themselves to their employer between friends and acquaintances.
"That's like a game of rope," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil wells
During the following years, no new oil wells will emerge in the Gulf of Mexico in front of the U.S. Federal State of Florida.
The Washington government has issued a corresponding ban, thereby abolishing its previous plans with final effect.
New wells are also forbidden before the Atlantic coast.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar said Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban, which should be valid for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the drilling tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this disaster, which cost eleven workers their lives and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new wells in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
This seeks to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign oil supplies.
To date, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The centre of criticism is the British Energy Group BP, which is confronted by billions of requests.
The Committee of Investigation, which Obama commissioned, should present the results during December.
In October, Minister Ken Salazar canceled the drilling ban that he had paid since the explosion.
They subsequently submitted various oil companies to apply for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters with more stringent controls and strict security regulations.
At present, the Audit Office is fundamentally reforming, which has highlighted many corruption charges.
At the same time Obama announced that he would cancel the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas companies.
Industry now warns openly that more stringent regulation will significantly reduce the volume of oil in the Gulf.
"The government plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the gas and oil industry", is the result of a current survey in the field of consultancy company BDO - before the ban of drilling on Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance still complains of uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what regulation will change."
Investments in new mining projects are moving until appeal - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of avoided oil destroyed nature in the Ogoni region in Nigeria.
People feed on stealing, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," calms the environmental activists: "You'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
A 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who roams his breasts with water that surrounds the smudges: the scene works in a water gloss with rainbow colors almost nicely.
You can't see that there's a brown oil clot under the surface.
She used to collect enough gernals in the vessels, telling Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetta River.
Meanwhile, slowly flowing water became dead.
Five years ago, it spilled into a huge bottled area from a broken management of a large amount of oil.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to get into waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, which is located in the heart of the Niger delta, belongs to one of the most polluted areas in the world.
On the way across the river, mangrove swamps with lots of side lines are only known for the entire range of the trigger.
The boat engine cooks a brown mash instead of light water, and whoever dips his hand into the water will pull out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves are applied from the ground as black poles of licorice, rarely occurring palm trees leave their leaves sadly hanging.
We are in vain looking for flocks of birds that are commonly found in wet areas: Once the engine is quieted on the boat, it will be engulfed in the former paradise, where it smells like a pump, scary silence.
"What is happening here is the ecological leadership of the war," says sadly Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
The comparison with the war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battle field where it has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe joined here, here in the 1980s formed the first resistance with a later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiva, here he had to stop his production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while it is used daily from the entire Delta area with three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometres of lead more than two million barrels of black gold, there is an oil field in the Ogoni region, for the group it is too unstable.
Each several hundred meters is drawn from the water of the steel structure as bizarre statues: Christmas trees, so the heads of drilling holes are called very tenderly.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusty.
Akpobari tells, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters per 50 years have leaked into the ecosystem in the delta: each year, the amount of oil that has leaked into the sea in Alaska during the crash of "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes that continue to be responsible for environmental disasters.
While Shell refers to sabotage and organised oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists refer to cracking well heads and leaks as the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than it is in the world custom, said the US-American scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only the amount of failures in leadership is said to be "sometimes higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks far away like a deserted, oil-stained workshop under the wide sky, it emerges from the mangroves of the figure: they are completely naked and up to their necks from the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected by guidance, partly scattered on the ground, burns fire: illegal small refineries.
Oil is heating up over the fire for hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, it leaks from the line to the capture pot of gasoline, then drops at the end of the kerosin line and finally oil.
In this way, Michael and his four coworkers make up to four barrels of 300 liters a day: "We make 34.000 Naira" - around $22.
Delta inhabitants are taking advantage of a chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in black Africa.
Nigeria only owns one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of 40 cents euro for a litre of petroleum can still overwhelm illegal producers: because they have free raw material.
It comes from "bunkers", which connect to leading everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of oil daily in the entire area of Niger delta.
But only a negligent small part of the temporary storage of raw materials is depleted illegally: the largest proportion of the organised criminal networks to which politicians and senior military leaders are to belong, to tankers and sell them on the world market.
The debate, whether the population has caused the disaster and its interventions or lax production, considers the Akpobari activist purely academic.
"If oil companies hadn't considered themselves intruders and if they hadn't completely destroyed the life of fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell is so damaged that it only involves leaving the group: "Maybe other nations like the Chinese will show up as better."
Michael's gonna upset you.
"The highest time for you to disappear," says the muscular manufacturer.
Soldiers can come any minute.
If a special military unit found them, they wouldn't risk jail, but a painful bribe.
Also soldiers who mostly come from the north country - like all Nigerians - want to benefit from raw material.
"That cursed thing got our country all the way down," says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction error in the engines A380
A380 apparently has a major safety malfunction.
The investigators discovered a possible mistake that could lead to a "catastrophal engine failure" during the search.
The air carrier Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas' airbus passengers probably had more luck at an emergency landing at the beginning of November than has been known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has found a major safety failure on the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
Maybe there should be serious consequences: there could be cracks due to wear on one oil connection, this Thursday in the published statement to the ATSB.
This could lead to a catastrophy of the engine.
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft series A380.
Among them is also the airbus of Qantas, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It gave reasons for the action at the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal action against this company.
Qantas' boss Alan Joyce said his company would request compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
The parts were released during the engine fire, and they damaged the bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce referred to as the cause of damage to burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further security tests with giant aeroplanes equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said spokesperson at the ATSB Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline left its A380 fleet for several weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its 11 A380 on a transitory basis.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with a safety measure for one A380.
Two-story aircraft is the largest passenger plane in the world.
National snowfalls create chaos in transport
Germany all in white: almost all over the country snowed overnight.
There's chaos in many roads, train connections, and planes are disturbed.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: almost the entire republic fell on Thursday night at freezing temperatures of snow - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, it lies in some places up to 15 centimeters of snow.
There are strong traffic on several motorways and many roads.
On A7 at Flensburg, the road service was still in place, but it was not able to handle the newly hot snow.
There was still a strong impact wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Office (BSH) awaits the Baltic Sea coast in Schlesvik-Holstein in the morning a stormy flood with a water state of 1.2 metres above normal.
Snow wills have caused considerable problems in Saxony on motorways and public roads.
According to the bad weather center Meteomedia was therefore the highest degree of violet in Saxony Switzerland.
From a part of there, it attacked 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused the winds.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left there last night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, police authorities reported major road troubles.
The wind and snow caused slow traffic and congestion to A2.
In Durynsk, there was trouble due to snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Durinland and Northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken top lines and switches.
In Saxony, the remote traffic must have stopped from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In Saalfeld, Durin, he had to stop an ICE from Munich.
165 passengers received wool blankets, food and drink on the train from firemen and rescuers.
The snowy wind is going down the road.
Many flights were cancelled at large German airports because of the snow winds.
According to the spokesperson, flight information has already been reported from Munich's cancelled flights.
In Frankfurt nach Mohanem, according to spokesperson Fraport, for 40 years.
Road maintenance is in constant deployment.
There are only a few passengers left at the airport, but 400 field beds are ready for them.
On many roads, there were accidents on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
There was a similar accident due to the snowy road near Nuremberg: there was also a truck caught at the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayereuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the morning.
And to that end, a 30-year-old woman died after she and her car turned to a slick road at Aschaffenburg.
Meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain light, and therefore will rise even with light winds.
But the wind will weaken.
Only by the Baltic Sea will the rapid winds of the wind force.
But it's going to be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for doubles towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say good-bye to her sign: according to one newspaper paper, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in Frankfurt's headquarters.
Property could be up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just refurbished its headquarters of the group: the towers in the Frankfurt bank district have upgraded; in the meantime, bankers have been allowed to re-emergence for their old jobs.
Now, however, apparently wants the financial group to renovate again - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, as reported by "The Final Times Deutschland" with an appeal to the spokesperson.
The spokesman did not name the reasons why the sale was planned.
"We are constantly examining whether the property is more meaningful to own or sell and then rent again," he said.
In this way, the largest credit institution in Germany is relinquishing its registered office after a short time.
The Bank took over the towers and doubles only in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investors of the own fund and then cost-renovated them.
Energy reconstruction swallowed around EUR 200 million according to data.
A lot of money would probably bring to the bank.
According to the newspaper text, experts estimate the value of the later renamed towers to the "Greenovers" for a price of around 500 million euros.
The spokesperson said it was not decided whether the building was to be sold again to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for dead miners
More than 10,000 people respected the memory of buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
It is still not possible to free the dead because the security situation is still complicated in the shaft.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a strong explosion in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were flooded in the mines below.
The shaft where there was a disaster was launched, but it did not reveal any sign of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces were unable to descend due to safety.
Second, a strong detonation was based on authorities and experts that miners no longer had a chance of survival.
Still couldn't free the dead.
Now they have respected the memory of dead relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people gathered in sunny weather on the southern island of New Zealand.
They shut up for two minutes.
29 tables, helmets, lamps, and miners’ names were built in honor of the memory of the buried miners.
Also pictures and personal things, such as clothes and surfboards have found their place here.
There were flags in state government buildings in the middle of a joke.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come out again from the "holy land" to the surface, said Minister John Key to the participants of the memorial event.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was killed in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the related victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the event.
During the explosion on November 19th, British and South African miners were also killed.
The rescuers began by extinguishing the fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as toxic gases are dissolved, it starts to cool down high temperatures inside the mine, said Police President Gary Knowles to the journalism.
To hell, warriors!
Is a horror fit for an art movie?
Director Nicolas Lifting Refn is attempting to conquer the old border with his battle epos "Walla Rising".
What kind of audience did the Danish director Nicolas Lifting Refn think of when he was filming "Walla Rising"?
The captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will free himself from his masters and kill in the great with almost supernatural strength of his opponent - it sounds ideal for young men looking for bloodthirsty action because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and even the guts of his enemies live when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One-Eyed, as it is actually called, will not say a word during the entire film, and the other characters will send at most one or two sentences, or they will be torn down to grueling dying screams.
Otherwise, they remain silent and rot in the horrificly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is more ideal for grown-up fans of cinemas with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It's a good thing if the movie has more target groups, it's just a shame if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantin, but it is hard to prevent his works from getting closer to either more humor in the main stream or less brutal to the artistic audience.
Most of the supporters of the artistic cinema seem to be discouraged by the pulverizing brain and intestines everywhere.
The beneficiaries of action films shall be bored at the latest when the One-Eyed will be released for reasons that are freely explained with a group of violent Christian missionaries to Jerusalem and will remain hanging forever in the wind and fog before the team can sail into America and remain silent there.
There is no wonder, then, that in Germany "Walla Rising" did not go to the movies and now it has only been released on DVD.
It's a shame, mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because, behind the individual facade, places to the broken blood, it hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this film, it's not about dialogues or the exact story, it's all about the atmosphere, the hot dream that became a movie.
And it's not for the viewer to escape.
Refn won't give him a moment of release and suffocate him slowly with its frozen images and a cloud hypnotic soundtrack, especially with the indelible hatred that plucks from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who helps the One-Eye keep something like innocence, everyone else is driven by evil.
Of all the most one-eyed hero, whose motives will never be explained, which will become a time for enemies and transient warriors from hell, perhaps an emissary of the devil.
He creates destruction, perhaps only for the corrupt ones.
"Walla Rising" is a mysterious movie that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
An experience.
Mysterious earthwork
The Office for Nuclear Energy IAEA has a new warning of the secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the countries are prevented from expressing themselves - and they are not even allowed to check.
Around midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007 at least four Israeli fighter aircraft F-15 I will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the bank of Euphrate; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometres away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Nuclear Energy Office (IAEA), it appears its name when it is a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in the valley that turns from the current.
On the basis of a message from the U.S. U.S. foreign secret service to the CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby village el-Kibar, would have been well suited for the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
A 50-year technique is no good for anything else.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
With computer animation, she explained where the reactor components could have been before destruction, this is a reduced copy of the North Korean Yongbyon nuclear center model.
In addition, there were still photographs that showed the building close to or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been shortly before its launch, but without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years of bombing, they don't know much more than they did at that time, even the puzzles got bigger in time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that the CIA was very certain before the attack that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but it did not basically have evidence that there was a "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some secret service rapporteurs in Europe are even more careful and speak only of a 'student reactor', even though the CIA presentation considers it 'controversial'.
They lack clear evidence, just like the IAEA.
When asked how confident he is that he has a reactor in front of him, he answered the UN's high diplomat in summer, the IAEA says he has "a lack of material to ask questions".
The suture of allegedly "unused military buildings" was quickly removed and also properly offset the terrain.
Still, in June 2008, the IAEA team managed by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar to find traces of uranium that was produced by humans.
In addition, via a Member State, the UAEA received satellite photographs of commercial sellers from the time after the attack, which should be more specific than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market because they exclusively bought by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a nuclear secret program and has not built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, he expressed himself to Damascus.
However, that was rejected by the UAEA after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss matters as well as satellite images.
In addition, it prohibited the revisions of the second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed buildings.
But Israel also keeps quiet.
"We will never comment," confirmed recently the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at that time.
The investigation of this case has been ongoing since June 2008 and "he is growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office", as admitted by the high Western diplomat at the head office of the IAEA in Vienna - it is after all a serious breach of the contract on the ban of nuclear weapons, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers it the key to progress in the case of another three devices to be "in a functional link" with the alleged reactor - and unlike it still exists.
The auditors have not so far listed, or what equipment it is or what function they have or why they are suspected.
According to information from the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAA internally referred to as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
An independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a complex of buildings on the satellite imagery, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is apparently located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely why Syria refuses to access these three places.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the UAEA would be a pre-deposited US to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence and satellite images that the material was transported here and there between these three places and the square at Euphrate.
In Vienna, he said a high Western diplomat that at least one ordered should be "in connection with fuel production".
But there are no "sensitivity evidence", i.e. to enrich uranium and reprocessing; the processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium came from and where plutonium should later be deciphered on the bomb, there are only likely estimates for these central questions.
It is also unknown whether ruins that could hide important traces are kept in these three places.
As if they had disappeared from the surface of the earth hundreds of costs of trucks, no one seems to have any information on where the rubble went.
Only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, and on the other side of Euphratu, the salt mine al-Tibni, which had Syria checked in 1998 as an appropriate storage facility for radioactive waste, considers the UAEA unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put him in touch with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, the images from the universe show that, after the UAEA requested access, Syria carried out earthwork in all suspicious places and removed large containers.
It may have been a coincidence, but it didn't help to clarify the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles speak of the fact that the UAEA has spent many months drawing up a revision plan that would allow Syria to maintain possible military secrets - only the effort shows how much interest of the auditors is.
Damascus has, in the meantime, rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna had calmed down a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, and that's why this thing is not burning, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about the so-called special inspections, which is one of the toughest means that the Vienna nuclear office has to impose controls for several months.
The head of IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have had to suggest an inspection, has already talked about "the possibilities to which I am in the future," but he is still hesitated.
This choice presents a great risk: On the one hand, the majority of the IAEA’s Governing Board is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, how does one diplomat point out: "What happens if they find nothing?"
Love at a time of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on a still nameless directorial primacy in summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote a script herself, it's the love story of a woman from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There's not much more to know yet - but it's causing restlessness.
There is constant talk of the fact that the woman who is Muslim will fall in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosen women’s associations protested immediately, so the planned shooting from Sarajevo to Hungary was quickly moved.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasevic of the Women's War Victims Organization wrote through the UN-organization to help refugees UNHCR Jolie and asked for an actress meeting, now informed Bosnia's newspaper - Jolie is also the ambassador of the UN-organization to help refugees.
She's not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the camps where there was rape, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victims reveals a lot of the script.
Thus, her organization recommended the UN-organization to assist refugees to release Jolie as Ambassador, informs the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write the scenes?
The Bosen Ministry of Culture, which was given to read its script, allowed smaller tahanics in Sarajevo to film - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author emphasises that there is no political intention in her film that she has devoted herself to the conflict in Yugoslavia with great efforts to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give room to all the parties involved.
Due to its content, it remains vague.
There is another version of the film on the Internet that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the war began and will again meet when it is like a bossian Muslim encamped in a Serbian camp where he serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds a little different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his guarantor."
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war - it's true.
Jolie claims that there is a pressure on her that "is not fair and based on incorrect information".
Now they can free her from Hollywood: By publishing illegally on the Internet her script, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone.
It's good for the Irish once again tonight.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates power significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans are screaming for the sound of loud music, butt-legged.
Bailey-Pub in Southair Cork boiling because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and hit.
"The beer pong" is called the bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning premium and to do so tickets to Las Vegas World Cup in beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shouted-out beer game and a brazen computerist, it doesn't fit well.
Yet, a 26-year-old man tries to have fun, to respond from the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not playing passion in Las Vegas, he's going to New Zealand interview in January.
"I have this weird feeling," he says.
"It's so far away, and I don't have a job there."
Yet: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "as soon as she got her dream job as Eventman, maybe it's a good sign", says a young man and smiles.
Two of the three Tanner siblings have tried their happiness abroad because of the wrong prospects at home.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT advisor in London.
The boys are leaving: Just like the Tanners, it looks in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people leave the country in the short term, predict experts from the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of ESRI in Dublin.
They even count until 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small land with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar migratory wave suffered by Ireland in the 1980 ’ s.
After decades of prosperity brought to the Irish, the dissatisfaction is now growing again.
The economic crisis is mainly marked by the young, educated Irish, who have so far experienced only a rise.
Loss of employment and social downturn seemed ridiculous these years.
Everyone needed it. Money was too much.
In the meantime, there are three out of ten men and women under 30 without work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters of readers complaining: "It's all going downhill in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - who can, he goes away and our country loses the whole generation."
"Please turn off the last one."
Leanne Caulfield's law student, the president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black, because the government only deceives and offers young people no prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs", says 20-year-old.
She observes how her classmates move from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move out alone in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the subject in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAgoodExpo", an exhibition that offers general service on the subject of work abroad.
"For beginners in the labour market there is an excellent chance of working abroad," says the manager.
On his website are photographs of surfers in Australia and skiers on the snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
He's known about what it's like to build something else for six months, Sean O'Donovan.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues at the construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he's working on extra shifts so he can pay home loan.
"Sometimes the situation is really a little crazy," she says, "when the first time after a long time it crosses the threshold of its own house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm basically not in at all."
He laughs and walks through cold rooms.
A small house is situated in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, large expensive cars parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for €300,000 - 100% funded by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions," she says.
Is he afraid it wouldn't have to go well with the loan?
O'Donovan's thinking for a while, pours down hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The construction engineer doesn't like the moaning he hears so often.
"No one needs to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, it's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who left for the last economic crisis in England.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep an open future and simply wait for life to develop elsewhere.
He's also been working in London for several years, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand too?
But there's one more thing he's been very concerned about these days: his 27th birthday party in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might turn into a bachelor party.
"No emotion at all," he says, "and he'll have a nice beer.
"Bye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a celebration of leaving, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Normal practice of democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing as well as the promotion of private business.
Criminal activity raises more concerns than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more powerful than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current survey Latinobarómetro, which took place in 18 countries and came out exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been regularly held since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the whole area.
This year's survey, which took place in September and early October, dominates two related issues.
The first is that Latin America is in a pretty happy mood.
The second is the increase in stability towards democracy and its key institutions.
The promotion of democracy in several countries at the edge of the Pacific Ocean in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth is on average 6% per year since 2002, the support for democracy increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
She also grew up in Mexico, where economics recovered after a deep decrease in production last year.
But only about half of those questioned in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are the beliefs of the Democrats, which withdraws the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the whole area have expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, it is the same number as last year, but compared to the year 2001 when it was 25%, it is a big increase (graph 3).
About 34% said they trust the House in their country and 45% trust the government, again it's the same numbers as last year, but it's a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, it undermined democracy in Latin America's economic crisis.
The aid was created during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, a stronger social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and that this year again decreased to 32%.)
However, the mood is changing in a wide range from country to country (see Chart 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President Luiz Inácia Luly da Silva is reflected in the broad sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where recession was more serious and the state of violent crime worsened.
Only the second time since surveys began, they see more respondents across Latin America as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but that is a decrease compared to the 38% of last year's data and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private business and the market economy: around 71% of respondents across the whole area say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% of 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system allowing their country to develop, this percentage increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% are in favour of private business), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a country with leadership in the area, as 19% of respondents mentioned (compared to 18% last year) followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered to be the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and in most parts of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised elections
No one expected the general elections to Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were much worse than the outsiders who were trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
The elections meant filling urns and repeated votes, voting tickets scattered over channels, broken electoral rooms and intimidation.
The election room is open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many moved out due to the January earthquake, roamed around and tried to find out where they could vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a number of presupposed candidates, shouted that it was fraud and called after the election was cancelled.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
Yet, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, stated that "in many respects it was a pretty good choice."
Observers from the American Organization of States and the Caribbean Community carefully said that "they do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily have to cancel the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are bound by René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martella, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former First Lady, resigned from their original call to declare the vote invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has small or negligible support between voters, will be identified by the electoral committee for reaching a decisive battle.
The cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people who were still living in states after the earthquake were concerned that the electoral participation would be low.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the disorganization they were prevented.
About 250 000 identity cards that are necessary for the vote have remained undivided shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so it is clear that the Haitians will blame themselves.
After the tip to the center
In the weeks when she suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, benefited from the sympathy of the public, when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Nevertheless, the conversion of this success in a successful campaign for the second term of office in elections next year may depend on the disparity of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on these marks, everything will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued his economic policy even after his wife was a successful president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
That allowed the first couple to spend more revenue at their will.
Mrs Fernández's government lost most in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized at Mr. Kirchner's death for a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of Peronist’s ruling political movement joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (which resulted in the falsification and accusation of the government of corruption), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for next year, with the President spending more space as he pleases.
The economy is overheating: growth is likely to rise to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 1.1%, but many private estimates and trade unions are talking about numbers that are close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the Bureau in 2003, when Argentina was suing economic collapse, set priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for the control of inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector and purged the INDEC, a statistical agency that entered into the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
She called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And her officials say they want to cut wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy has been supported by the rise in world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández knows that she wants to restore Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government set up an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused a debt restructuring that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
She now faces President Fernández's deal with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be supervised by the IMF as usual.
But last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" in order to propose a new national consumer-price index that would remind the introduction to clean up INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after her term of office when her husband is no longer with her.
If he wants to stay, he needs a middle class support that is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of the Argentines' return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If he wants to win another election, he will have to decide whether it will be necessary to turn down the many opinions that her husband held in politics quietly.
Half Encouragement to China
Taiwan's voters are closer to land.
What does Taiwan think of their big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those entitled, voted on 27 November by the mayors and councils of the city in the five districts, which may be considered as a wider evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail to the land and have a strong establishment in business relations, including a partially free trade agreement, in the greatest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but only close.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended the victory of three of the five mayors, she could not win most of the votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has won nearly 50% of all votes against the KMT side.
If this was a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of his party's vote has decreased by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP side was together with KMT in city councils.
The elections took place as a majority of the Taiwanese elections, which include loud election trucks and mass gatherings with flags with savings from the girls.
A secret assassination attempt was even a part of it.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was agitated for KMT candidates on the eve of the elections.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien cleanly through his face, hurt him and killed the viewer.
It was not deduced whether the armsman intended to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, suspected falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Perhaps China was the only great campaign winner.
It was remarkable how the question of land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates were involved in the plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
KMT therefore tends to avoid ties to the Government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also dropped out of arousing anti-China attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and the awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, confirmed that China's policy was acceptable to most Taiwan.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue in commercial bribery, together with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the flock.
China did not waste its time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
I'm sure they'd like to see political integration, but first things first.
That would be better to wait for the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was on the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on the basis of corruption charges.
President in 2000-08 was a rebel and advocate of clear independence.
But under Mrs. Tsai's leadership, a new generation has evolved, which is moderate and DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate to the president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their actions can take place without prior conditions.
Mrs. Tsai informs the Thai public that her party is a "trustible alternative" to Mr. Ma's accelerated approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In the declaration issued from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better off insisting that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's evaluation was bad, despite the excessive pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
His disapproval seems to be based, in particular, on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
KMT spokesperson says he will reorganise his cabinet, as well as local branches.
The strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan for establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration to be inevitable with China.
According to Antonia Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has passed."
Nomination at the Grammy Prize: The Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
A speech at the request of the President and the people must observe the law.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer, whom President Obama chose to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, is referred to as one of Grammy Prize Surprises this year with nominations in the category of the best new artist.
Since Spalding was a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came out a little late, but it is in accordance with Grammy rules, when the artist must not publish more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is determined."
Its 2010 ambitious album "Chamber Music Society" certainly recorded a step forward and thanks to its carefree vocal style and playful hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success that was recorded in 2003 by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent to the voter in Grammy, who have been looking for a similar jazz work in this category over the last years.
In other cases, Grammy judges rightly appreciate Vijay Iyer Trio's album "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing album ride that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of experienced saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a crispy favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest on HBO "Trem" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise favored to Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
The Wild band Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of the Steampunk gained several well-deserved recognitions in the category of large files, when the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble stood in competition and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octa "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bass player could have his free hand as a band player.
Nomination Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in the category of classical music
The nominees for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards.
The head of the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with the number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with the number of three points.
The Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles" appeared among the nominees in Southern California, a work that was ordered through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer, based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto, also has a chance of awarding.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, operatic, choir and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producer of the year has five nominees, such as Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificum - the Art of the Castroti" introducing various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As regards the category of the opera, nominated are Berg and Lulu by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and Marc Antonio e Cleopatra from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saaria and L'Amour de Loin from Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Family Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are nominated at Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonen.
Approximately 30 minutes' work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and Mandolin Concerto were nominated for the instrumental performance of the soloist with the orchestra.
The L.A. composer stated that he wrote a 15-minute work especially for the mandoline artist Avi Avitala, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"I wrote it with the help of notes from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in category for orchestral performance, for leading the Chicago Symphony during recording the work of Stravinsky.
The instrumental soloists who received the nomination include Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists, only women were represented this year, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Viviana Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic transition, soprano Jessye Norman won the nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Planned mosques in Temecula are approved by the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecula has received unanimous support from the local planning committee for more than five hours often by passionate public testimony.
The critics attacked a project that promoted terrorism and would lead to a suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center was consistent with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"These who are opposed are screaming loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The meeting started at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost midnight, when most of the time they discussed with people who were for or against the center. These voices were evenly divided, says Press-Enterprises.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no America anymore," one comment appeared.
"We are a planet of monkeys with the statue of freedom fell into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also triggered protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the places of tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001 when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community, which was about 135 families, had been living in Riverside County for years without an incident, wanted a bigger and more suitable space than the storage space he rented with the filter system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24 943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
She should take up a place of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometres east of Chaparral High School.
The opponents can still refer to the city council about the project.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the space to search for new forms of life on Earth and perhaps further.
Scientists have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has possibilities that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and fundamental so far.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"Can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very special, but it is not evidence that it is some form of truly 'immorious' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, coauthor of the report, which appeared on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
Long was considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California are able to continue to grow after the arsenic replaces phosphorus.
"You will begin to wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, coauthor of the news.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life can look, said Anbar.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this news published in order to discuss it, which did not reveal details of the finding, has caused widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not that.
The discovery of 'reports that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' need not be so necessary for life," explains Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arzen and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so it considered that a microb, which is exposed to both elements, may be able to replace one after another.
"Arsen is toxic mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can hardly separate these elements from each other."
"However, the arsenic is so different that it does not work like phosphorus. When it gets into the organism, it will start working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists gather bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic that are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better with phosphorus, but given that they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility of a life-form that uses arsenics can appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant to microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced with phosphorus, is not new, but never an example on which this fact would be proven.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that he could have used his early life forms.
"This suggests that there could have been other ways of creating life, not just the way it was created in the early period of Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The other two of the four show dogs that were stolen from Bellflower's motel were found, reported to the Los Angeles Sheriff on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two akits and a large pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, told the authorities.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs were later on Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, spokesperson of the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found in what locality they had found, nor did he share detailed information on their finding.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," said Whitmore.
"We follow the rules."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught to comment on the case.
They were very pleased to find their two akits at a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's representatives found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old Trace dog, and a 10-month-old bitch Didi, were unharmed, told the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek breed, who were planning to participate this week in regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unfounded until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they were planning to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions planned on the days before the exhibition AKC/Eukanuba show, said Peek daily The Times on Wednesday.
South California is only one stop for almost a month's travel of a couple after dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered to the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took with them three dogs - a boxer puppy, Parson Russell Terrier and a British fireman - who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a little bit so the dogs would have enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car theft at 6:00 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who led them to missing dogs.
Thursday, it was unclear whether the prizes would be awarded.
Lion is ready to scream again now that the restructuring of the MGM is receiving final approval from the court
After 18 months of quake and uncertainty, MGM finally got green so that it could start again.
On Thursday, the federal insolvency judge in New York officially blessed the "pre-packed" creditors' plan to settle about $5 billion of debt and clear the way for a 86-year-old entertainment company focusing on film production and television shows.
The fourth return, that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy rules, leaves no legal obstacles to the MGM to relaunch the founders of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the leading leaders of the degraded studio.
The number of employees will fall to approximately 320 of the original more than 400.
MGM will not suddenly emerge from Chapter 11, until JPMorgan Chase has agreed on the planned financial resources allowing a loan of $500 million to finance the new operations and production of MGM.
Now it's a merger with an investment bank that needs $75 million on its own, and funding is expected around half of December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009 when Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to solve its finances, as management fought to afford interest payments of $300 million per year.
On that August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and a turnover expert, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelise and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After a few months of discussion, the parties agreed to give the company a sale at the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several candidates, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the finances requested by the creditors.
In the spring of this year everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements the plan was finally approved by the creditor at the end of October.
When MGM officially rises from the audition in the following weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received 1.2 million dollars, will receive a $ 9.5 million payment.
Cooper's companies, which collect $375,000 a month for their services, will receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restore production in MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will come out at the beginning of 2012.
They are also planning to participate in the financing of two films, the book "Hobit" will be presented together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of these two films directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debts, sought to merge the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, which is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technology toys that will keep your budget on gifts in balance
The leading candidate for this year is the most amazing toy of iPad followed by the video game system. In both cases, however, this is a significant intervention in the budget for gifts.
Consider that at the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX wheels for $99 and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 coral boulders or approximately 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ'sWholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law worked; this year's technological toys have much more energy, at the same prices, if not a little lower, than in previous years.
While relatively less new toys appeared with affiliated websites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increased as well as toys with battery charging.
Here are some recommendations.
(All listed prices are from Toyota "R" Us, except in cases which are otherwise marked.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their belly.
At one touch, the animal will release a tone and the second press will start to make a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: You can't stop as soon as you're makin'.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60$, from 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed a 14 inch animator doll on Elmo Live Technology, which can play the game Simon Says and also manages a monthly walk thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel blocking.
The kids are testing Mickey's dance instructor toy, although their parents complain about lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the 1980s, you might remember the Alpha, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, 40$, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn car ride into a fun job with a self-correct, funny workbook.
If you're snooping around the smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
In Tech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years old) it is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboard, although the games do not have such an effective lesson as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years old), the first major leapster change from Leapfrog series, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years old) uses iTunes-like to introduce games and e-books and has a slot on a SD card that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a set of five cubes that are not larger than a matchbox, each has a LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing cubes in a row before the time runs out; it is great for competing in improvising words.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two toys were represented in the toys Webkinz and Club Penguin.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2. Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5$, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains a coin with hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credit at Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or Puffle animals.
A little bigger than your toothbrush's brush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years old), the latest of a series of microrobots on a button battery.
The bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's funny if you make a maze out of the cubes and watch if he can find a way out.
He's also very resistant.
Ours was able to fall with the kitchen table and even spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
Implementing Finer Police Control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked across the square, strictly controlled his orders and gave orders half-armed with military authority.
He wanted women's members - Chinese brave enforcers of urban order, feared and despised for their hard actions and a taste in violence - to convey a certain impression on the fools around them.
Stand up straight!
"Come on!"
Show them, whispering quietly, "what nice girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood out.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as according to the ruler.
Four headgear fit perfectly on hair that are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"I personally think they look mediocre," said Mr. Tang, blatantly.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered new goalkeepers to have higher education.
Guangdong Province has changed gray-green uniforms to supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan replaced the strong armaments in Central China: in 2009 there was a report that 50 officers encircled an inextricably cart with snacks and looked at the owners, after half an hour of packing and leaving.
Xindu, a city district with 680 000 people in Chengdu chose surgery as the main image.
Since 2003, the county has supplemented its city police with 13 women, who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, dimensionality and young age.
The goal is to show, in addition to the gross side of the police, a finer woman's side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese city groups.
The critics would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce a city decree, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media tend to capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei beat an unparticipating viewer to death after using his cell phone to shoot as they started in the procedure for protesting the dump.
Last year, police training took place in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual included a description of how to beat up the perpetrators effectively without any signs of blood.
This year, a melon peddler in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered injured left side of his brain.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded on the Internet depicts Chinese policemen attacking street dealers.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, lamented last year after another discussion about tactics.
The paper said "really thoroughly cleaned."
The skeptics say that this approach is not enough.
After the district advertised in October interest in eight new female policemen, the opening of The Beijing Evening News addressed whether women have real responsibilities or are merely distractions.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The county required female candidates from 18 to 22 years old with a good figure and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have heights higher than the average - which is more than 1.6 metres.
Service at 26 is compulsory.
The shareholders claim that work is mentally too difficult for women over 25.
"Her image is an important thing," said one unappointed police officer at Rednet.com, as if government websites.
"The candidates must first demonstrate external quality, which then determine others, include height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the character and "internal quality".
Women are like flower vases, said and added, "Besides that they will be vases, they will also have different responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district management, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that the requirements for height are also common in China for other positions of employment, both sexes.
As well as a request for dimensional features of the face.
Which means that the question of good thinking is the subject of discussion between the Chinese.
I'm sure the disability or mutilation will not apply.
"He cannot allow a chrome or brittle man to serve with us," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps watch in Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like apples and gently shaped mouth.
She doesn't think that the emphasis on her appearance could have a sexist character, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-workers with downs, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our job is to represent the city image."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they have said because their career ambitions are greater than just to drive traders into alleys where they can perform their activities.
Every morning, there is a group against more than ten marketers who run on foot or on bikes and try to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu before they are banished.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We have told you many times!" said Miss Xu when the marketer started running, and for a while left his bike with a noodles cart.
Policemen describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day it's basically the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies his marketing day off.
"Big routine."
One reason is that female policemen do not have the powers as their male counterparts to entertain the goods of the seller.
They can only threaten to report this fact to their male leader.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rebelled after false rumors about cops killing dealers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night; 14 government vehicles were knocked over or lit.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street that morning patrolled the police officer.
The police confiscated the motorcycle, which was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The bike owner could have cried like he wanted.
A 15-minute distance from the police officers, looking angry, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to a male group, remained behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 who already have only a auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintenance and coalizing image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li in effect.
"Mostly it's the public who's gonna start this."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges concerning his affairs with his former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, announced to the senator on Wednesday.
The decision ended with the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, the Republic of Nevada, faced and which, up to the time of the scandal, was regarded as a possible Republican candidate for president for 2012.
Mr Ensign's office said that he was a decision that followed almost a year's investigation "rejoiced."
The senator could still face the disciplinary proceedings of the Senate's ethical committee.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that it is not planned to press charges against him on this matter."
The Justice Department has refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr Ensign prepared a violation of the ban on federal lobbying.
The interviews, e-mails and other documents that were published in October 2009 at New York Times reported that Mr Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure the lucrative lobby that would lead to Mr. Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a cashier in Ensign's campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after he was hired to lobby for them, so much are the documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was until recently an assistant to Mr Ensign, he was excluded from the law of lobbying his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethical experts say that the unusual settlement of Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were before the affair of friends, appeared contrary to the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that was published "it came out that this is a clear case of preparation for the violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Justice Department refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the matter of Senator Ensign, Mr Brand and other lawyers specialising in ethics said that the Ministry is careful with regard to political actions, after a large number of failures, including last year's decision to suspend the lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens in the middle of a charge of doubting the State's attorney.
Federal prosecutors "have clearly hidden their weapons", said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of the Civilian Organization in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a legal group that has filed several complaints against Mr Ensign on this case.
"It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not subject to laws," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr Ensign's chief lawyer, told him in an interview that he was called by the D.A. of Justice on Monday and then the next day, and he told him that the Ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr Ensign's defense team is working with the prosecutors in an effort to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in the Wednesday declaration, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments which he forwarded to the State's representatives.
"I do not like to list the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decisions," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to suspend the investigation of a separate complaint in which the ethical group filed the charge that Ensign Hampton's parents' payment of $96,000 had violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Board stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a gift.
One company Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find the lobbying work was NV Energy, the main company in Nevada, which has been supporting the senator for a long time.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started acting as a lobbyist in the company, the head of Mr. Ensign's staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "buffed" to the Ministry of Interior about the subject discussed.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton for the lobbyist work.
When last year's report on the matter first appeared, Mr Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned as the fourth Republican head of the Senate.
After many months of stagnation, Mr Ensign told the reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third term of the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign no longer aims at investigating the crime, his spokesperson Jennifer Cooper stated that the senator hoped that the ethical commission would follow the Ministry of Justice quickly and end the investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the Nevada people," she continued.
The challenge of the village of Cheshire is to Twitter
Half a dozen were written in the ranks of the courtroom.
After a minute, they sent word of a terrible testimony over Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter reports were concerned with rape and child bonding in a house that was lit up.
On Thursday, there was a trial by Steven J. Hayes, who was sentenced to kill three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, and it was due to end with the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed an appeal with applications and arguments that the court would probably employ for years.
One of the most provocative of all is that intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter of the main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with incitement details then introduced a jury in a decision in the sense of affecting public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to address the question of whether new rules in the courtroom would also be required to take on board new technologies.
"As I have seen in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ulmann, Chief Defendant of Mr Hayes.
The judge of the given trial Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State briefly rejected the claim concerning the proceeds from last week and the fact that the media were "respected" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted under public influence.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognised that intelligence of notorious cases can raise questions about the justice of the trial.
In the 1966 order of the Supreme Court of the United States, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the trial was "carnival atmosphere" because of the media means.
Some are convinced that this crime was the inspiration of a TV show and a film called "A fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeal courts which examined Hayes' judgment half a century later might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary to establish a way of communication from the courtrooms, which was unimaginable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, a law professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty at Connecticut and wrote a report saying that it was performed freely.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be interested in the idea that restricting direct communication from the courtrooms may make the process more fair.
The case of Twitter is only one of Mr Hayes' many pictured lawyers who would be able to argue for years to put an end to the execution of the sentence.
For example, defense attorneys also claim that in the case of Mr. Hayes, it may be a predicament when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential judges by showing them criminal photos of horror when choosing a jury.
Some of the judges reported that they were horrified by the photos of the victims that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The defenses argue that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge has wrongly appealed to a judge who was critical of the state representatives and that he has misplaced his decision to impose more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think on the weekend.
The judges were not separated.
But their arguments on the impact of the scope of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They raised an objection to the verdict of last month that the case dominated the Connecticut reports and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media kept blowing up the flames of emotion in this case.
"The day-to-day media, cameras and reporters in court," wrote a lawyer, "there was something that had not yet been seen here in New Haven, and it may also be a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists claimed that the immediate reporting was more upsetting than the reports reported later, and from their point of view, the judicial police should manage the field of application of other processes.
But some lawyers have requested appeal courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation of courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in the case of Dr. Sheppard, on the basis of the wide range of proceedings, and they wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "presents the Sheppard case versus the 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the abyss?
This week, a small amount of courtesy appeared in Washington, following a campaign that was remarkable in its insults and negativeism.
Is this the first flag of true cooperation between two political parties or just an illusional moment before a quick return to a party fight in the capital?
On Tuesday's meeting with President Obama and the parliamentary leaders, there have been no major discoveries regarding the fundamental issues to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of the party's party.
The Wednesday public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close synergies for a few months have built up mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological gap that still divides the members.
And it's kind of hard to say that she started a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in the trial period - they are studying each other signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and the electoral patience towards the renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday's negotiations and subsequent evaluation of participants were also carried out with minimum requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too extensive and too deep to propose a rapid change in the circumstances that have been in place here for the last two years.
Whether it's a question of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are a mile away.
However, the November elections prepared Washington at least quickly.
"It is not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"You are inevitable after the elections.
The election was aroused by the strainers' emotions, and then they shut up.
It's okay."
In a few questions, especially those to discuss at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding solutions.
Bush’s tax reduction expired at the end of the year and no one considers it favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Like a likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because the Republicans cannot look at how they support tax reductions for property while the unemployed reject unemployment aid.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is already greater optimism about the possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new opening treaty.
But William Galston of Brookings Institute points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between two political parties when the 112th Congress calls on January.
Rather, there is a likely period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing things that need to be done, psychology in a short perspective will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism - which is largely widespread - in order that courtesy leads to real cooperation.
"I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The reasoning is to a large extent related to the compilation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of tea parties who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, know that they must behave according to their promises and must reduce government spending and repeal the new law on health care.
These reference lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reform of the tax Code and increase of certain taxes, increase of retirement age and decrease of expenditure.
The joint presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, have put pressure on the issue of deficits for the public programme in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus to fight as close as possible.
The greatest opposition is among elected officials in the jury who propose that, in the case of financial issues, we have, at least today, small foundations or wills for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first one will start in the form of party conflicts next year, when Republicans will call on Obama to address budget, taxation and health care, when there will be a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is much evidence that, despite partying in the last elections, most Americans want to continue to see the two sides that work together.
If it could turn to the heel, as was the case in 1995, then both parties will closely monitor the public response.
Whoever threatens to reduce the votes, will likely change the course and seek a compromise.
That could be an optimistic view of the matter.
Stranicity and direction are now greater than that of the mid-1990s, and it appears that there is a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Parliamentary Republicans than was the case with the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a foreplay for more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, a lot of Americans would be welcomed by the courtesy that appeared this week.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
The revealed American document depicts Moscow as a refuge in corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and it continues to be part of the bribes and bribes for protection that come on the way to Kremlin, stated the American embassy in Russia on February.
Police and the Federal Security Service have largely held protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal trades but also from organised criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical office" - takes his own when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The recording sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at the time when Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor and blames him for a large share of corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only see minimal changes in purity.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have constantly denied corruption charges for many years, and won several charges for perjury for such claims.
In September he said to the Russian television station, when he was asked about the proven testimony of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's crap."
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their society is corrupt, it will show up for the vote.
It is unusual, however, to meet with such details as spoken in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
"The government of Moscow and its connection with the criminal elements some have led to call it 'dysfunctioning,' and confirm that the government works more like kleptocrat than a government," says the report.
"Criminal elements are enjoying the so-called 'Krisha' (the term of the world of crime and the mafia, which literally means 'the roof' or protection), which is provided by the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior and the Office of State Prosecutor, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of Moscow.
"Analytics have identified and three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is on top."
"Federal security service, Department of Interior and Militia are second-degree."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are common criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill empty places in certain areas, as the city does not provide services."
The report says that the FSB takes money from the biggest companies and the police focuses on smaller businesses.
One source said, "The owners of trade in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Interior (more than from organised crime groups) because they do not have only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, criminal gang protection is no longer so on course."
The record says that while the money selection is complex, protection itself can already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who don't pay fast enough, their business under various pretexts is closed.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he had only made little progress.
The embassy report is talking about men taking bags, probably stuffed with cash, to Kremlin himself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow research team indem.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because there are no political classes in Russia anymore."
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates Russia's worldwide corruption costs over $300 billion a year.
The countries are ranked 154th place in a recent survey on global perception of corruption by NGOs Transparency International (the countries are classified from at least to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the American embassy report, which appeared in Moscow in late evening hours, certainly did not create enthusiasm for the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be charged for Moscow’s shortcomings, it could be a possibility for Kremlin to argue on the issue of solving the problem.
In an interview for CNN with Larry King Putin, he said that the documents WikiLeaks published could have been counterfeiting and had an angry reaction to the statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvede Robin.
"The truth about the whole matter is that it is our mutual interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical."
Veterans of the Red Khmers are forced to deal with the past
In a savings-lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "cutchhiker" for his rawness during the Government of the Red Khmers, the commander remains in this remote Red Khmer holding in northwest Cambodia popular, where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers have given up the government, there is also a long-lasting loyalty in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims at the forum of truth and reconciliation were allowed to publicly confront those who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks explaining the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers for the first time.
And in July together, the UN and the Cambodia Court of First Conviction of the former Red Khmers, the execution of the sentence of the former leader, the notorious violence association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With each such progress, there was an increase of unrest among the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, which makes efforts to reconcile and their attempts to rejoin the Cambodian society.
"My former Red Khmers is a grudge and fear, but they are helpless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life among the Red Khmers was beautiful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Government of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, it was estimated that 1.7 million people were executed or starved, to sickness or to reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowd the Government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled on the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There they began a rebellion that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sara were driving guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok was cultivating supporters in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of Red Khmer fighters began to move to a government that culminated in the surrenders of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured by government forces in nearby Dangrek mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Red Khmer warriors have fallen into the ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefit from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which leads public forums all over Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by utopian agrarian ideologies of the regime."
"They were raised without any idea of making trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who entered the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settled as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"That mok has fed everyone."
"But now life is hard, because we have to make sure of everything ourselves."
The current court of the Red Khmers also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Khmers.
The Court of First Instance has a mandate to prosecute the leaders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases in question.
It was little to calm the fears of Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, which was a regional leader in the Bantea Meanchey province during the Red Khmer regime at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
Last night Im Chaem and Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and the shadows appeared through the drenched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Red Khmers.
If the court called her over, she'd refuse to go.
"Peace reigns in Cambodia and is stable," she said.
"If there's any more criminal prosecutions, there'll be war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ran over from the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought out other suspects, although experts and historians disagreed with it.
"The Kamboda must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia has to do for moving forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer conditions means blinding broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The Centre published the first textbook approved by the Government on the Red Khmers, has 75 pages and the name "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Red Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew very little details about the Red Khmers, despite the links between the city and the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said that a new textbook helps students understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents responded sceptically when he took home the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be prosecuted."
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, textbooks, and court are beginning to influence, he said further.
The Red Khmers still have a strong spell here.
Upstairs in the Dangrek Mountains is a weed-covered road with pruned plastic bags that leads to a rectangle made of black soot covered with rusty metal roofs.
The body of Pol Pota was burned here at a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, mobile salesman on the edge of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at that place.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea was her birthday, and she was planning to visit Pol Pota's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas hoping it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees that it appears to its stock of uranium-based weapons
In a surprising victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they would give up their stock of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The Agreement was published in a joint declaration, issued following the Security Summit of Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government has tried to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have hit the rock last spring.
But the U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months a couple of classified operations had been carried out with Belarus to remove £187 from the Uranium Research Facility.
This prepared the ground for the Wednesday agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately £500, according to the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was apparently a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent 2012 summit.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the summit on nuclear safety 2012."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group supporting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all their stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's summit on nuclear safety, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our commodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes only, that's all."
However, Belarus acceded to the United States a few months ago and showed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove the Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, announced by officials.
It was loaded on a special train, which traveled more than 1 300 miles to the Russian storage and disposal facility, said officials.
The second operation was closed on Monday and it was carried out by air, said the officials.
The US government spent $13 million on the program, most of it on delivering less enriched uranium to the Belarusian research institute, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"All things were coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust", which led to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Beniawski, an official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Three Reduction.
This year, James Martin Center for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to a joint declaration, strive to remove its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, especially because of Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But the Wednesday statement suggests a possibility of gradual melting.
"We welcome the progress made on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognised that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and this is essential for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government has not worked with the flights of the CIA
The Spanish Government has not done any valuables regarding flights by the CIA to the Taliban and Al-Qaida to Guantánama through Spanish territory, as expressed in its telegram by the United States ambassador to Madrid.
This follows from documents provided by Wikileaks daily El País, where it also says that the first Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández, de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed and "could thus show that it has adequate oversight of foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, a meeting took place between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega in which dozens of countries were charged, including Spain for their involvement in human rights violations, following a communication by the Council of Europe, which was held.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the message of the Council of Europe "disbarred Zapater's government from the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide on this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with flying secret services through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "not caught", reports Aguirre in one of the documents.
Also, then Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos suggested to the US ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible outline, but by the fact that this matter was in the hands of the judges, had limited possibilities of influence".
In February 2007, D.A. Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as it is concerned, he did not intend to block the initiative of the Judge to request the declassification of documents from the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating component or any sensitive information", explained the Embassy after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US has expressed its concerns because of"obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than because CNI or the Ministry of Defence information was declassified.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to deal with this case discreetly between governments", regrets Aguirre.
On the occasion of lunch at the U.S. Ambassador and Minister of Interior Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, the ambassador told the ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they will consider appropriate", he had already instructed his colleagues to "do away with indignant comments with the intention of reducing tension".
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the political party Party Party Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - note) in this matter.
"In spite of her general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Party of the Popular will not hesitate to take advantage of any indication that Zapatera's government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as potentially human rights violations, even if such disclosure could have negative consequences for the United States government", he notes.
The mother-killer's admitted complained on the network on the mother's "old age"
A young woman was talking about a baby when she was already dead, and she had her blog, "Terror in Galician."
Mónica Juanateyová Fernández calls herself "Muki".
She communicated with her cousin and at least one friend, both of whom are Noia, in the area of La Coruňa, from which the young woman originates.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life, which the ABC daily reconstructs with the help of witnessing her family members.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with an industrialist named Ivan Túnez in 1998.
They dated for one year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
A man wanted to know if his newborn child was his, but his ex-girlfriend never let DNA test.
Soon she found a new acquaintance.
Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame, was the chosen one.
Their co-existence took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner who even came to see her for a week in Palma.
However, from the content of its communication, it is evident that the relationship has collapsed.
She's alone in Menorca in March 2008 and writes, "Alberto's upset that I left for work."
"When I told him, he seemed fine, but now he realizes that he has to be with a little guy all day, and he can't do whatever he wants."
Then she's talking about the text message she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address to send you a baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving a baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
in May he talks about his return to his residence: "I'm going to go there this week, but I'm only going to stay until the 19th because 20th time I have to go to work so I don't miss this place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll take his son to his place.
"He will be with whom he is to be with me, and he will never again be able to leave him with anyone other than my mother," a questionable intention given her bad relationships.
There's another post in July.
When he breaks this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and probably was murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"César is happy on the one hand, but on the other hand he is not."
"On the one hand, he's with me, and he likes it here, but on the other hand, almost every day he goes to school."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"She's going to go to summer school, "so I'm going to save some money for the nanny."
The 17th greetings and complaints.
"A big mouth from Caesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you no email videos, look how he wants, he'll meet with me, sex is needed."
On the 30th, another report: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one report about Víctor, the current partner: "He's giving me money."
On the Internet, the Monies' contributions are made on the scars dedicated to anime and manza.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she had her name called "Muki ex-con."
"Terror in Galician (motto)."
The last man she lived with, the guardian, expresses her pity and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Last night, Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma, where she arrived from the detention center in Menorca.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maced, said that the defendant doesn't remember how everything happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one."
She admitted earlier, however, that she drowned César in the tub and put his body in the trunk.
The defense and the D.A. are demanding psychiatric examination.
People would get 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 mandates.
with the results of 28 November, the party of the PP could have the main word at city halls in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in the votes received and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan Party (Catalan Party) already has an idea of general elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the national elections is usually one of these than the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan people received 610.473 votes in the general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, this figure was only 316.422.
Last Sunday, the PPC (Calyst Party) received 384.091 votes.
If this tendency to increase, which has been supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the voters of the PP, analysts of this party have calculated that if the general elections are held, the PPC could obtain 12 Members in the House against the existing 8, the CiU (Convergencia i Unió, Czech Convergencia and Union) would also have obtained 4 mandates (now has 10) and the PSC would have lost at least 9 chairs (now has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of crucial importance to the parties of PP and PSOE (Spain Socialist Party).
According to this analysis of the people, the ERC (the Levic Republic Party of Catalonia) would lose one MP - now has 3 - while the ICV (the Green Initiative for Catalonia - noted) would continue to have one mandate or would have obtained another.
However, according to the election calendar, the nearest meeting will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where the people could also have a decisive impact on the end of the domination of socialists in four major provincial cities, as well as on changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest budget forecast - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree with the possibility that PSC could lose City Halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not receive the majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
In view of the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona Council - as at least 5% of the votes must be obtained.
The PP side increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists believe that they could play a major role in the turn in Tarragon, where they ruled together with the party of PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP won only 500 votes more than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
People have also won other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
Currently, PP has a representation at 34 City Halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al-Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, three more were arrested in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and one Nigerians who were arrested by agents of the General Information Commissioners in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which established passports for the various groups of Al Qaeda, among which were "Tigs of the liberation of Tamil Ílam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", the second group being the author of the assassinations in Bombay, where 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, it aims to ensure the weakening of the Al-Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at international level and to "restrict its operational abilities".
The investigators estimate that this cell could send thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years it was active in Catalonia, where they were then counterfeited and then supplied to groups forming the criminal galaxy of Al-Qaeda so that their "fighters" could travel unpunishedly across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active one that had the jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units participated in such investigations besides Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that in the following days there will not be similar interventions in other European countries, such as last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In connection with this operation (when Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqure Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigeria Babatunde Agunbiade) further developed in Thailand, where Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were captured.
It was these men who were driving from Bangkok a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, the part of which was liquidated in 2009, especially stole passports for tourists that met Islamists' requirements.
That means that the documents had to have belonged to men aged 25 to 45, had to be valid for several years, and had to be visa-free.
The investigation documents point out that there are no facts yet known that link the captured from Catalonia with the assassination in Bombay, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination was sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency of about a thousand dollars that were "introduced" to purchase cards into mobile phones that were later used by members of the "comanda" that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PP) demands Mas to stop the fiscal agreement
The president of the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchez-Camachová, yesterday, had the opportunity to personally present to Arthur Mas his terms and conditions under which he is willing to support his appointment as President Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is the recovery of the economy and the waiver of risky businesses such as the economic agreement which the nationalist leader wants to propose during his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples has come to a meeting with Arthur Mas with a certainty of 18 parliamentary chairs received in the elections last Sunday, which is more than satisfactory for obtaining the popularity, so the candidate CiU needs at least one of the formations forming the opposition to abstain from voting on his deployment to the office.
The possible compliance with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists in the House would like to maintain when the general elections are held, but so far the talks that are held in Mas these days with the rest of political leaders are held in the Catalan spirit.
As for President PP, in order to get her support for putting her into office, "he will have to end all sovereign and liberating speeches", as well as with an economic agreement - similar to the one from Basque - which the leader CiU even wanted to vote on in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to depreciate the overflowed political apparatus of autonomous governance and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Masov’s introduction to the function will be addressed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
He met with Joaquin Najd (PSC), who promised a hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Director of the Geriatric Facility shall ensure that deaths have not occurred as a result of a "resistance of measures"
The presentation of Olot Center does not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The head of the La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) geriatric centre yesterday provided a press conference to show what damage caused the institution of the criminal behaviour of Joan Villa Dilmé, a caregiver who, while being employed here, killed at least 11 seniors who were in charge.
The head of this home for seniors Joan Sala has appeared with the lawyer of the facility, lawyer Joan Canada, and has announced that "the wish of La Caritat's home would be able to press charges against the culprit responsible for killing, but "the law and responsibility oblige us to leave this trial to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because it has not revealed the criminal activities of the caregiver in good time, the La Caritat home now poses a great threat to the material compensation requirements already calculated by legal representatives of the families of the deceased.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had already occurred in August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing since then
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight clients of a home for seniors suspected that in many cases the deceased did not examine any doctor personally, but that - given the age and poor health condition of patients - everything was handled on the phone.
La Caritat resolutely rejected this extreme yesterday through her director and stressed that "the lack of measures could in no way have been the cause of what had happened".
La Caritat's attorney added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party would have committed doubt except for the defendant's own indictment".
A man now named "An angel of death" confessed yesterday 11 deaths and specified that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killed the second elder a month and a half later.
in this case, death caused by the administration of too high a dose of insulin, as opposed to the first case when it used a mixture of reassurant tablets.
Director La Caritat added that it is complicated to control staff access to medicines.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were probably in six cases out of nine the means used by the caregiver to kill patients in their efforts to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analysis now in the laboratory should show whether Vila does not lie and actually seek less cruel death for his first victims, or he killed them by giving a log, as he has already admitted to three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not believe in health claims and do not rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than he admitted to and justify his behavior in various versions, which He gave to the Court knowing that he had to change his actions when eight people were found to have been killed.
That is why they say that they want to be available to justice in order to illuminate the full extent of this matter.
The European Central Bank is in danger
Yesterday, investors reacted violently to the threat of President Trichet of the European Central Bank yesterday, pointing out that "markets should not underestimate our ability to respond".
The marginal differentials have been closed by force and shares by the European bank have fallen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be wrong - the euro has just increased beyond its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an liquid market, which, although falling, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
The investor will take some time to lose his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as bringing the liquidity back today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan for the redemption of sovereign debt for the inefficiencies and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within a period of time and leave unlimited access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate of the forecast 'minimum until March' and keep the three-month auction with unlimited access to the end of this trimester in order to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and that they will even announce its intensification.
If it does not meet the expectations created, it will restore the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to withdraw the liquidity levels, God is with us!
It was the same at a convention in May where they claimed that they did not even consider buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - tomorrow history could happen again.
The European Central Bank must be credible and sustainable.
In May, the armored fist announced on Monday, and on Wednesday, she said that she had bought many of them, causing another market collapse.
Last night's bonding was very poor for one year in Portugal.
El Tesoro only issued 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Therefore, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting the change in the mood of the market followed by Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures represent the losses of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent approximately 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, and by February they have a chance of becoming private capital, otherwise they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the problem did not reveal stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the auxiliary plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to get the approval of the new budget by Parliament and it still does not have sufficient support, so that Ireland continues to have uncertainty.
Angela Merkel reduced the tone of her speech to release the tensions in the face of the next EU summit held on 14 December, where there is a political compromise to show that we are the Union and we are all on the same ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven's Ode for joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of action approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, employment recovery measures - to investors' ears sounds like a four-year period from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange increased by 4.5%, twice as much as the other European stock exchange.
Unlike February, the response of the government and the Spanish National Banks was quick and convincing - we seem to have a surprise effect.
Today we have here a key bond auction for three years, which will be favoured by the Trichet effect, which, we hope, will be a great demand for it, which will help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
To ask for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They'd give us the cash we don't need - there's 40,000 million in cash in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - even higher rates and market access would be closed down to a sin die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use Cesar's woman's strategy - "not only to be it, but also to seem it".
We can do this.
The President of the Eulen Group will attack Vega Sicilia's negotiations requested by his children
The storm in an open conflict in the family of Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, remains silent.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack him after he has taken him for "almost irrelevant", the legal proceedings of El Enebro planned for 16 this month and the requested five of his seven descendants, on which these should try to force their majority and be taken up with the administration of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons, Jesús David and María José, are adhering the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest company service holding company does not seem to be willing to quench in his dispute over membership in the ruling authorities of El Enebro.
five of their seven descendants, who were appointed leaders during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January this year and whose objections were raised in the Commercial Register.
El Enebro's proceedings scheduled for the 16th of this month, which was convened by Commercial Court official number 2 in Madrid, have restored the thunder in the womb of the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is, until the dispute is resolved, the only legal means which guarantees the convocation of the committee.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of the Álvarez Mezquiriz considered David Álvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving through judicial ruse and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the negotiations of 18 January, which was completely invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal assault of this conduct as 'a completely irrelevant one'.
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, tried to convene the court in June without success.
In El Enebro, a group that owns beside other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Álvarez's 100% capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder requires 51% of the capital to be used.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when dealing with the question of judicial assault, and the date of this trial has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software proposes improvements in real-time vehicles.
Since Red Bull came into Formula 1 series in 2004, his history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this new incoming team, and despite the rising trend in recent times, they all settled on the Ferrari Fernanda Alonsa triumph.
Without wanting to reduce the riding skills of the champion, Sebastian Vettel's German, or Renault's ability to drive his car, the legend "secret weapon" was born in Formula 1 world, which Multinational Siemens put into Red Bull's hands to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software that simulating marches which the German company put on the market in 2007 for the purposes of a very remote car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines at production plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or to simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and spending.
The PLM has facilitated the development of Canon, Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this software device allowed Red Bull to perform "over a few hours, in almost real time" modification and improvement, which otherwise detects during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992 the stables employed on average 10 technicians who were able to perform no more than three or four improvements in one period.
Today, Red Bull is working on 180 highly qualified young professionals equipped with powerful information technology who analyze and suggest any type of modification of racing vehicles.
The manager of Siemens explained that PLM is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles except for the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are being modified.
It is possible to convert changes from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using lasers and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical capacity is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has established a race 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings, which are restricted to visiting - especially to journalists.
Everything that's going on here is considered a "big secret."
The list of participants includes 580 people, including two pilots - the Vettela Champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is in Formula 1 without doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, other protagonists whose aid is priceless and unknown are hiding behind the immeasurable technological means that the brand of energy drinks has placed in their participation in racing circuits.
The head of production technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in research and development of vehicles contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was the merit of the riders.
Currently, this ratio has changed and technology is worth the successes of 85%, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology because they are "unforeseeable gladiators".
HP will set up 20 own shops within two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with her business partner Pont Reyes opened her first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
The company will be the first of the network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 which the multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
Spanish vice president HP Helena Herrer described as an example of a newly redesigned market at Gran Vía, Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, who has been working with HP for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan for the establishment of 200 sales points in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is the third.
Herrer didn't want to reveal where other stores would be opened, but she admitted that Madrid might be one of the following.
Herrerová, who also runs HP personnel systems, ensured that the philosophy of opening shops will still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises with exclusive design of sales equipment (with products that can be interactively tested) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with the provision of staff for business.
Helena Herrer denied the fact that it was a franchising, stressing that the exclusive sales network aims to "improve customer service, services for small and medium-sized enterprises when purchasing, operating, after-sales service and even packaging".
Trade in Barcelona is part of a pilot pioneer program at global level to solve possible problems with computer devices in the guarantee.
Online service is linked to a technical centre based in Maastricht (Nizoland).
"So we'll be able to solve problems within 10 minutes, which can take up to two days."
"This system is especially designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and regular customers, given that large companies already have contract technical assistance services", said Helena Herrer yesterday.
Sabadell's betting that he's going to steal a million clients within three years of his competitors.
Optimist than other bosses, seconded member of the Board of Bank Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a difficult year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of a passive war.
Nevertheless, it is calculated by reducing interest rates, which will try to compensate for the reduction in bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to get a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell has found a way to take advantage of the next three years and the power to survive in difficult economic conditions.
In 2011, the Bank will launch a new strategic plan with effect for three years.
The aim is, in addition to survival without the need to address public aid in FROB, to gain market share by capture of a million new private clients - respectively 700,000, if those who, if any, leave the bank - because until now and also the Institute rather pampered small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses rather than small clients.
This year the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 companies.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while it is more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or it is also possible to say sobriety, with the aim of reducing the costs that the bank will present when it presents results over the period.
At this time, few banking institutions dare set their targets and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of global banking.
Sabadell will close his Optima programme, set up four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension for the next period.
Clients who leave savings will be their main target group.
At the meeting held by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "heavy and very important".
Indeed, he feels that the way out of the crisis in Spain will be "suffering".
In addition, in two or three years' time "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although they believe that the passive war - which reduces the margins - is relinquishing, the price of premiums for the risks that banks and savings are paying for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thus offsetting the reduction of margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will represent a pressure factor on loans".
"We haven't closed the trigger yet, but the differentials are very high", admitted Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued his network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of November 22 and November 27.
He also recognised that the tendency in banking "now is a reduction of commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
The Bank’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "they will demand larger size".
"The next year there will be no stone left," he assured.
It confirms that the capital needs are "well reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions enter among the red numbers.
It points out that the FROB can complement the gathering of funds on the market before the new capital measures.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it continues to pose a serious problem of what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it is not possible to issue but, unlike what was in June, to receive short-term financing by means of repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of mergers of savings
CECA Director-General refused yesterday that a further wave of savings mergers should be created, and again he insisted on the speed with which the reorganisation of the sector is carried out.
When he started the process of grouping Spanish savings, there were several institutions that ensured that this first stage would not participate and would wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should be created.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, incorporating Cajasol into the Banca Cívic Group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening are conventions".
"Most of them are completely done; instead of 17 constitutions, we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which worked very well on this matter", noted the director.
In his statements to the ADEA meeting (The Association of Leaders and Executive Officers of Aragon - note:) Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration is being carried out "at the highest possible rate and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the instalments, which had appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank", he stressed.
"Go from 45 savings with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% so that these are larger and thus, in accordance with the Basel Treaty, underlines.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are many not very happy views on the slowness of the process", which show "the lack of seriousity and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank does is to remind us that we must be before the end of the year in due time".
yesterday, CEO of CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta assured that Spain has the most stringent financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and that those who question this have acknowledged "the lack of knowledge".
The director noted that, in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" with regard to financial institutions and also the system that managed the "very important" process of concentration and which continues with "the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking industry was very well based on the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and Red German Line
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro but has set conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets provoked a twofold government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, through regulation of private intermediation agencies or cancellation of EUR 426 for unemployed persons without benefits, to privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spain airports and air traffic management - notes), the airport manager Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felip González, has, on the other hand, joined the critics to Chancellor Angela Merkel's address for her responsibility for starting the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
It will be said in advance that Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what his future should be, which reflects the idea of respecting the old traditions that many other members hold.
Faced with European opposition, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible routes from the crisis.
The first one represents a strong euro area, which would be part of Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, for example, while the southern states would leave the monetary zone.
The second is a return to the market - although it may now appear like a scif, this version has broad public support, close to 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to the German proposals, to rework the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary tightness, fines for the guilty states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and the extension of possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time now, so there is no room for rakes now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged deficits in 2009, the German constitutional reform brought out of hand the German government to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of contradiction between what Germany considered to be right (the plans for fiscal severity and stability of public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second showed this Central European country when Merkel was painfully stretching decisions on the rescue of Greece.
It was already the subject of acute criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion which was also published were strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October Merkel appeared again with a clear opinion when it required reforming the European Union's Convention in order to allow the rescue of a Member State and, at the same time, to have a private creditor's duty to bear part of the cost.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European, as it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal has been approved in a somewhat mild form, and in the coming months we should follow the Union reform process, which should allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has identified a red line that it will not cross.
And it tells us to all of us that although there is now a need to take measures that apparently do not agree too much, the old euro will be over from this date.
The year 2013 will represent the birth of a new monetary zone in which countries that violate the rules will be severely fined and may be forced to declare the deferral of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the cost.
Germany suggests that we need to make a strict growth path with an increase in savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments that Spain’s growth boom ruled during the years, simply does not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not only about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much harder.
And the worst part is, under these conditions, we might be wrong.
I hope these current turbulences replace greater peace.
And to take advantage of the opportunity they're giving us until spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his dual statement (reforms promised after meeting with the big businesses from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) gives him the sense that through criticisms at Merkel's address, the way of thinking that things need to be put right.
However, the red line that Germany has set out is here, and it does not seem to want to move with it.
And from the options that can be considered, there is no way to leave the euro area full of too few serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circumvention
Finty's demonstrations of Alonso and Ramos in the fight with Ajax show the wit not the intention to escape the punishment.
The supposed exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alons and Sergia Ramos) in the League of Champions against Ajax on November 23 has caused that the sea of ink has been released, whether this is or is not a non-sport behaviour, and whether UEFA should eventually not punish both footballers.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which had their team clearly won) appointed players one by one deliberately wasted time in the moment when the foul was supposed to play to provoke the barrel, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfil the prescribed penalty in the following match against Auxerre - while Real Madrid will end up in its group at the head - and will be able, freed from the cards, to continue to the next stage.
Finally, UEFA Disciplinary Commission granted Coach José Mourinh a penalty for two matches and guilty players received a fine of money.
The provocation of the yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, i.e. rules that are unsanctioned, but watchful.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was a Real Madrid team (who boasts nobility and honor in his anthem, who has already repented for similar acts of his player) and, as it seems, also thanks to the drama led by Mourinh, who thus adds to his long history a comedian and provocative of another episode.
in any case, the debate is about whether this kind of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is a circumvention of law in these acts; indeed, it is an action that respects sports rules, the sense of which, however, seems to be trying to circumvent.
The type of damage caused by such actions is solved in a sporting spirit.
One of the elements of sport behavior is the physical inviolability of opponents who have not been violated in these cases, or have not been a violent game.
Another of these features characterized by a pure game is to avoid that players, thanks to their misdemeanor, have an advantage towards the team's opponent - which also did not happen here.
Thus, paradoxical at the action of players of Real Madrid is the fact that what we do not normally characterise as a ruse or circumvention of the law, there is no hidden breach of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour should be as visible as possible in order to receive the penalty.
They waited and liked to get punished.
But the next question is, what advantage will the guilty have of their intentional misdemeanor?
Here, it must be noted that the opponent is not in a disadvantaged position and that he will not achieve any benefit in the current game, as the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club won't be able to count on these players.
The advantage is clearly that players will begin the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardise their participation in the future game.
However, this is an advantage from the long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. the team can be eliminated at first sight, and in addition to this, the players will be punished, and they will switch to the second round of cards in which one card less than in round one is sufficient to exclude.
So as the wheels continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, and well, these actions do not go against the sport spirit, which is part of making strategic decisions that will allow for maximum benefit under the rules.
in the case of which we are dealing here, the players did not aim to avoid being punished (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather to choose when to be subject to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or running away from punishment.
Although the line between wit and circumvention is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly an ingenuity.
It seems to me that the polemics arise for two reasons: because they were two self-exclusives and because of the way in which the instructions for their conduct was transmitted.
The damage to sports principles by these events is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
Dictate calendar concentrates this year on the avalanche of reservations on 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations covered by employees themselves are rapidly increasing, wanting to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, the arrival of December comes again for Christmas parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis they have resulted in a fight to obtain clients by reducing prices: almost everyone wants to spend EUR 20 to 30 for food, the enquiries of entrepreneurs and associations from this sector.
In order to complete the complications of the numbers, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas came on Friday) applications for a week from 13 December, resulting in an avalanche of reservations for days in the peak (16th and 17th), while in the previous week there was almost no operation.
As has been happening since the beginning of thin years since 2008, there are many companies that have canceled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to leave the tradition, many employees pay their spending at parties from their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demand price at the limit of capacity, says the President of the Gremi de Restaurantació de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patron of the restaurant facilities is not at this time to predict what celebrations will be this month.
"People will change their minds before making reservations."
"They want to get along, but when it comes to price themes, they're careful," he adds.
Businesses will go well to those "who will offer quality and good service at a favourable price", she says and recalls that due to the crisis customers tend to go down and most of the customer wants to spend around 25 euros now.
Examination in various facilities shows that the biggest strain of booking requests is on the evening of 17 December.
Soteras Group reports a real boom reservation this Friday, with the most requirements for spending up to 30 euros, which has adapted the menu offered, with total prices of between 25 and 30 euros.
In another important company, which is Andilana, which reads 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of this year's calendar has brought more early reservations since the beginning of November.
"We made it possible and impossible to keep the prices from last year, and our menus, each of which should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euro", state.
In AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, the groups remain optimistic after they have seen a profit increase since the second half and have quite solid prospects for Christmas sales.
The sources of this company point out that December 18 will also be a busy day, as there will be pre-night celebrations among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 Euros or more, because they recorded a trend of spending 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spain sparkling wine - note.).
They have also noticed that companies are already showing up, which are again inviting their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
Fecasarm’s vice-president (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centers in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he begins to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "revived", although clients "contract to the maximum".
Even during Christmas celebrations, this impression did not give up, no matter who pays.
Pakistan’s nuclear program has caused great restlessness in the USA
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a faster pace than any other country.
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published by the Wikileaks portal, confirms the extraordinary unrest that the Pakistani nuclear program is inspiring in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details that offer regarding the content of communication and ideas of the North American diplomacy representatives in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear security instead of increasing, "is at retreat" and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored after parts to make their destruction difficult in the event of attack - represents one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is what the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, calculates in one report prior to the visit of the National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear equipment to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The increased number of nuclear arsenals associated with the missiles programme is no longer observed only by the US, but also by Russia, as a spreading and representing reason to be on the lookout.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with strict religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; because of the decline in education and culture levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs or missile-controlled programs", said the expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with their counterparts from the USA.
The biggest new documentation published by Julian Assange is increasingly the lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear weapons proliferation and an increased rate of Pakistani production of these weapons.
Depese issued by the embassy in May, which qualifys for communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", says: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain unrestrained or rejected".
in the next report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, states that, despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world."
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington, during his visit to General Ashfaq Kayani's army, "very well explained" that "Pakistanian army must end with silent support for terrorist groups".
Hon at the head of Wikileaks
Obama calls a high-ranking worker responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol issues a "red call" to track and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assang is a complicated labyrinth where it is hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday "an emergency call", the so-called red note, to "location and monitoring movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates back to November 20.
And he has no business dealing with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but the sexual abuse charges that Australia is facing in Sweden.
In addition, the attorney assures the creator of Wikileaks Mark Stephens that "police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
It was November 20, when the congregation of international police, based in Lyon, issued this order at the request of Sweden, did not, however, publish it until yesterday, when he received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange "with a view to establishing temporary ties and issuing them".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of the person concerned by the red call, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the so-called red notice as allowing arrest to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national police component - especially if the States have a bilateral agreement on the issuing of detainees, such as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be found.
This step was made worse by Assenge’s lawyers, who published writing yesterday, claiming that the ninety-year-old founder Wikileaks was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities through videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which compares with the legendary Lavrentij Pavlovič Berija, Head of Security of Stalin.
"This is a hunt and not a legal persecution," says the letter.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, but does not silence.
On Monday, through Skype, he gave an unfamiliar interview to the chief editor of Time magazine - in this interview he demanded the demise of the Foreign Secretary of the United States Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to carry out espionages in the United Nations and to break international conventions that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion yesterday was rejected by the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for demise as "senseful and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should care about the individual's view of the website," he said to CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking worker responsible for combating terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The idea of President Barack Obama's spokesperson to stop adding Assang to the importance is contrasting with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are now declaring these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be chairing the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber from January, asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organizations, "that anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance could be intervened and prosecuted".
Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange should "be killed", which he then had to call off.
"Obama should give him a reward or use an unmanned plane or something like that."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist priest, the former Governor of Arkansas and a possible candidate for president.
"Whoever in the government is responsible for leaking information has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too mild," said Fox Station.
Puigcercós is looking at the ERC calm "swamping" on Caroda's attachment
The Republican leader will allow the secret party to vote on its duration.
Huguet proposes more plural enforcement and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós has apparently found a recipe for how to fight the already several internal revolution in the ERC (Levic Republic of Catalonia) series, which has failed due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture regarding demise seems to be insufficient to support former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weak as its leader, and that he cannot do absolutely as much as he had with other lost currents.
That's why the leader of the Left will try to get new criticisms using winking to help him get into municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to speak secretly for his office.
By using voting tickets, not by lifting your hand.
If Carod's followers wish to give the chairman a criminal vote, they will be able to do so without fear of retribution.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid dissolution and subjection to his own person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half a vote and one additional vote, but added without specifying the percentage that he would also not be a good result of "in Bulgaria".
Carod's supporters demand more from the President than to give their function at their disposal - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcercos controls at conventions the largest authority.
But given that they do not have the majority to enforce demise, they will try to make an executive reminder of the plan from now on until May.
They therefore expect to participate in the drafting of a strategic reorientation document, which will be voted by the National Council on 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to move the Congress already in autumn 2011.
The ERC leader stated that "multiplying" is damaging stability, and that its aim is for the organization to be able, once and for all, to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems to be a remarkable article signed by current advisor Josep Huguet on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcercós' ideologist, this innovation adviser took the finished thing that the leader would be confirmed by "exchange for several purposes".
And he appointed them five, two of whom stand out.
The first is the "overcompilation" of the enforcement to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means including new faces that are in the Carod sector.
The second goal can be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should complete its meeting as a mechanism of operation.
And so it fights for reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates chosen by votes.
The completion of the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction at the last two conventions.
However, the 2008 convulsive Assembly decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special congress on the reform of the Statutes.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the Party has discouraged the resolution of this issue.
Now, without the lagging critical sectors, it might be a good time to rethink this matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November 2010; 390 in 2010
According to the journal MILENIO, Mexico had a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, as reported by the daily MILENIO.
There's three women's cases of murder, and a couple of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
There are 390 killings in Mexico, probably related to organised crime, in the past month of the year.
Among the cases stands out the finding of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitulán, in Toluca County.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, then a blow from grace to the head, and had arms and legs bound by rope.
The next day a body was found in a trunk which was stored in the luggage space of the vehicle above Mixtecas street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Soon on Thursday, November 4th, cooperatives discovered a body carrying signs of torture and at least three deadly shots to the chest at Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal in the section of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body there was a report signed probably by a criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was killed by eight shots after he came out of his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two victims were killed in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony in Ecatepec County in the head.
in Chalco there was found dead body of a man shot in the forehead on a remote road in El Naranjo colony, and shells of a caliber weapon were found under the body 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in a sewer of wastewater in the Playa Golondrin colony.
The rescuers carried out a thorough search for other parts of it, but they did not find them.
Residents of the Tepotozotlan reported finding a body with their hands tied back and wrapped head on the spot of Pen Colorado.
A man had a gunshot wound in the back.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage area of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the Atizapán de Zaragoza district was reported, and reports of death were also found in the victims.
A day later, she was found in Valle de los Reyes, Los Reyes La Paz, a cardboard box containing a human head.
In the nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in a bed linen in the village of Zoquiapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, a dead man was found killed in a yellow-core sheet, who was preliminarily identified as Mario Ríos, according to the report left by the killers in his body.
Ixtapaluca was found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla without signs of life with two wounds to the back.
A tattoo of sacred Santa Muerte was discovered on the skin of a woman (sacred death, literally) and necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group was found dead in Zinacantec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found, who had their head wrapped in tape, and there was also a message in the village of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In the victim, the report was probably written one of the criminal organizations in which it said, "This will happen to those who do not adapt".
two bodies were found in Ecatepec, carrying signs of torture and bound limbs, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Centre of Justice in the colony of San Agustín.
The last day of the month were found remains of two men in Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl counties.
The first one was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and left behind a message; while the other was tortured and found in a plastic packaging in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, there were agents and a note with the news.
China is respecting its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
At the UN COP16 climate change conference16, the representative of this country assured that its country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon footprints, and specified that it insists on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, a representative of the country at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public address at the 16th Conference of the Contracting Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said his countries have already invested 245 million dollars in trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the last four years.
But he made it clear that China will not change its objectives and will continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He reported that the Chinese climate change strategy was divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been made, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
In addition, he stressed that the federal authorities cooperated in China in coordination with the provincial and local authorities in order to achieve their targets for energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Furthermore, as he has reported, they are in progress or various multiannual plans have already been completed, which are financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, it is, as stated by the Programme for the effective use of energy that has been introduced over the last five years and which has received investments from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
There is also a provincial project of climate change, as well as a project to exchange bulbs for savings bulbs and a project to mitigate and adapt.
Martin Krol, the country’s specialist climate change advisor, assured the same table that China’s efforts were greater than it was generally thought.
For example, he indicated that greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts to use energy - for example, it has increased 20% energy efficiency over the last five years and expects to make further progress by 2020.
Exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party) stated that the former chairman of this party is entitled to demand a request from the National Order Committee of his law.
The national president of the PAN, César Nav Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was prohibited, and that the former chairman of this party was entitled to address the National Order Committee and claim his right.
in an interview which was received prior to the statement of opposition by the State Governor of the State of Gabon Cué Monteagude, he said that the exclusion of Espin was in any case a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to appeal to the National Council's Order Committee in order to act on a decision taken by the competent authority", he added.
He further explained that it is now not time to think about 2012 and that it was never at the negotiating table on the presidential candidateship of the alliance.
Mr Vázquez expressed his conviction that the PAN would come out of the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor would be elected, to be strengthened.
"This (alance in 2012) is a topic that has never been to the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, was a intention for a local election that was successful and fulfilled its purpose", he commented.
The President of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue is behind him, and therefore "we are not moved by internal competition, we are being burdened and strengthened by it", he added.
He said that the committee could, without debate, elect the best chairman or chairman, who deserves to be elected for the next three years, so he will hand over the staff to the committee to whom he will determine.
"I am absolutely calm and relaxed, so I will hand over any of the five to the President's office proudly."
He foretold that the rise that the party had recorded in the last July elections will be reflected in the future clans, although there is no time to think about 2012."
"Now it is necessary to escort Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, which have roots in the alliances in Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloe, will present the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, because "the many expectations and desires are put into them, and I am sure that Gabino will meet these expectations".
When we asked him about the critics of President Felipe Caldecznik side of PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institutal, Czech Revolutionary Institution Party, notes)) because of his speeches within four years, César Nava urged the members of PRI to think about the six-year periods of former Presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If they believe in PRI that Zedilla and Salinase's governments were better than Fox's and Clade's leadership, then let them begin to defend them, let them come out of their shell," he testified.
It has been said that the Chief of Federal Executive has the right to express himself as he did during his speech in the National Auditor, since no gag or censorship is used in this country.
Obama promotes law on Twitter to support students without documents
"If you think the approval of Dream Act law is right, let your senators know and insist that they approve it", tweeted the American president on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today contributed to his personal social network account Twitter joined the national mobilisation to support the Dream Act, which should legalise students without documents.
"If you think the approval of Dream Act law is right, let your senators know and insist that they approve it", tweet Obama.
His brief report draws attention to the Internet reference to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to contact the senators without delay, as the vote on this law is coming.
"As soon as the vote is expected to take place, now is the time to let your opinion shine," he points.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless an extension of the Bush era tax reduction and government financing has been approved.
Such blocking, which was announced by letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could influence the vote on Dream Act and other projects, such as ratification of the new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesperson expressed that he believed that once the fiscal theme was resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects would be possible.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we can reach an agreement on this matter and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters", he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of Chamber Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he will ask for a "voting for a discussion" on Dream Act law, so that the proposal for legalisation of students without documents could be voted in the Chamber from next Thursday, although it is more likely next week.
The Senator's approval of Dream Act, or "American Dream" law, would legalize approximately 800 000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country during the last five years and were admitted to a higher education institution or to the army.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve the proposal, so that they need the help of several Republicans, so that the organisations of its supporters carry out intensive agitators to ensure the approval of this law.
The Democrats most of whom Dream Act supports have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, stated that he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, had expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act project need to obtain several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators who are most engaged in the negotiations are the senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the outgoing senator from Florida George Lemieux, who added the term of office of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they have declared that they will no longer support it.
The other Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed itself.
Although the House of Representatives is resorting to another version, according to most analysts, Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature insert their finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put the finger into the wound" is a parallel of the Czech "to strike the nail on the head - note.)
The second round of the Enjoyment cycle was a promenade where participants demonstrated the literary gala performance
"This is what I understand about Sex in the language, but... The first in the morning? What is awaited of me?", the writer Luisa Valenzuel asked, who was invited to start the second round of Enjoyment from the language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitling (at another trade fair, they devoted themselves to the subject of Sex in the language round table, explained).
In the morning, "us brings us to the narrow", the Argentine writer told the audience, composed mainly of young people, who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, to hear this debate at the Roundtable, moderated Marisol Schultz and the participation of Valenzuel, Sergia Ramírez, Mayra Monterrey and Luis García Monter.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that Gonzalu gave Celori and which Schultz later referred to as a great story in which Luisa appeared in the first person as a protagonist, who goes from a doctor to a doctor who does not get her answer although the traces of the same story do.
The infectologist is leaving convinced that "the patience is not my strong side, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, he explained that the wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the morning represents a truly open and symbolic scar".
The protagonist took a light breath and concluded that "the wound was only able to learn so much that it was really open and that it did not exist", but acquired the belief that the pleasure and ramifications in the language must go hand in hand together.
Writer Valenzuel played both.
Nikaragujec Sergio Ramirez also performed with a charming story called the Praise Invention, in which the finger is not appointed in the wound, but at one point appears.
with the elements of magical realism, she tells of the famous witch who played the clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or fixed the integrity which one virgin lost, this story which then turned out to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning his own chroniclers who told it did not miss it, and is quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the exorbitant in the story of the conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all (a writer), mocked with a fake testimony that was presented in stories as real, but in another way never managed to tell the story of America with such an imagery that lacked even a student."
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have a greater fantasy" and just where reality and a lie come together, where they no longer know what the story belongs to one group and, as far as the other, achieves the fictional literature of its peak.
That is indeed what the Cervantian tradition calls it.
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Mayra Monter then stressed and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with its first chair made possible in the morning.
The Cuban-portorian writer showed her finger at a great blow to social violence that passes through her countries - and it is shared by Latin America - and is the result of commercial disputes and drug trafficking.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs make a silent compromise which is not intended, of course", said she after she said that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
In the evening, he closed a Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also put the emphasis "on this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and control of consciousness, which overwhelms dogmatism, he forgets that "it is not small behind every approach, and for every denial it is also small yes".
"To be masters of our thoughts and reality we must color: and to dye means to put a finger in the wound many times and to harass those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, black and white, in fixed eggs and without dye, and also to harass the authorities that prefer this black and white world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes to his first title
Rubén Omar Romano lists three defeats in the final, experienced both good and bad during his career, but he has already achieved three occasions on the decisive series.
in Santos Laguna and Monterrey's duel in the finals, two different styles will meet with their own techniques, teams that have a clear difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano is counting three defeats in the finals, he experienced both good and bad during his career, but he was able to achieve a decisive series on three occasions, but up to now he left with the unscrupulous one, and that is why this opportunity is extraordinary for him.
Argentinian had to settle for the silver medal, remained a step behind the winners, and performed the following finale with the same team.
As a coach, the Santist strategist got into his first final in the Apertura 2002 tournament when he had in his hands a Morelia club, with which he fell overall 4-2 against Toluce; then again in the clausura 2003 he advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with Santos Laguna in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010 tournament, again against the "The Devils" from Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Senaries" (another nickname of Deportivo Toluca) after 210 minutes of the game indisputably 2-2, after a series of shootings he got to the advantage of three on one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but in the end his three players passed from 11 steps and the team suffered a turn to 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the Red Devils of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and rid himself of the curse, and so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says he is the most important institution to him.
"I want to come out as a winner, I do not want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passions I owe, and the title would be for me, of course, but the first one is the most important", said the coach when he was asked about the numbers that speak in the finals against him.
in the living memory has the previous final, in which, as confirmed, he learned a lot, "we learned that until the referee whistles the end, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for the action, as well as the players, because the last two penalts, we were ready to go out to celebrate, and I think we have learned in this until the game is over, we cannot celebrate."
He is not concerned that this series might decide in criminal shootings, he believes his players: "You never try to reach a series of criminal kicks, you try to end up in the normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and we need to be ready for it, in the last tournament we were prepared, unfortunately, but fate has prepared us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, it left something in us and hopefully this time something like this will not happen."
Romano has a chance in his hand to stop being the other man and to taste the first glory they bring in titles.
The United States amends the rules on the issuance of visas
People will have to contact the Services Centres for Visas before interviewing the Consular Department; costs will be lower and waiting time will be reduced.
The process of discussing visas to the United States Embassy and consulates will change from 10 January 2011.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the visa applicant's centre (in short of English ASC) before the interview at the Consular Department.
The staff of the ASC shall receive biometric information from the applicant and shall be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total costs of processing the visa will be lower, the fee for agreeing the meeting will no longer be payable, the second for processing the application and the other for delivery of the transport service document.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current tariff remains unchanged: an amount corresponding to 140 dollars per tourist visa, $150 per visa cases with applications (including temporary staff visas) and $390 per visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to have an interview with a consular officer, but will only turn to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Given that biometric information will be received in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with the Consultary Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Similarly, those who will apply for a visa at the consultants in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee for a 26-dollar service.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
An American space agency called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in finding an alien life.
The National Aviation and Space Office (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that can confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock by experts in astrobiology, science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, dissemination and future of life in the universe, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured her that she would introduce "a discovery that will cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life", which has stimulated speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures, living in inhospitable conditions that have been considered uninhabitable, and who could represent the possibility that they will one day become intelligent creatures such as humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
It seems to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Create in some way arsenic uses for its life and it is this that its ability increases the probability that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have an atmosphere like that on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another form of life, different from that we know".
The Space Agency will announce the true scope of the discovery at the press conference tomorrow.
The conference will be attended by geologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who explore Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón produce the opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the coming of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period has not yet started when the opposition block was created in Congress, led by MPs of the parties of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democratica, Czech "Shoda" and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvem, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to the House.
Before the opening of the 60th parliamentary period Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo "smoothed" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it excludes them.
With this reform, they repeated, starting with "bapartism", because now it will be two of the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilarova, the Head of the PRD Party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit from the PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - note.) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca in the function of Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally form a political marginality from the impulse of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario institutional, Czech "Revolutional Institution Party") and PAN.
He specified that during the following days he would speak with representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme based on political will, and if these do not have it, they would be subjected again by these two parties, thereby ending the opposition coalition.
"When I came here (the opposition coalition), I look at it because we are disbarred from any decision, even they are not willing to consider the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergencia stated that they were in line with PRD, PT and Patron and therefore would form a plurality group.
It is not possible to allow, to continue Congress after it was monopolistic, it is now "dual".
It is not the aspirator of law reform that there will be endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and her members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza by PT explained that at present Congress has become the "presence" of two - in an objection to the PAN and PRI pages.
"Secondly, only one party ruled it, two sides divide it today."
Patrón Montalvo asked for respect for the Member's personality to be given a seat at the table.
"For the five of us Members, who are likely to be nine now, but right now they see us at five, not left behind because of the skewed agreements, everyone else in another fact, we have united ourselves to find a place at the table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and agreed, we are standing outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
Another 200,000 pesos for "contractor" is issued.
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay another check discussed to the owner of the company supplying electromaterial.
Another check for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent to Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos by the city hall.
This sum paid in this second half of the company owner supplying electromaterial will climb to 1.200,000 pesos.
According to the City Hall's transparency website, this last check was sent on November 16th this year, it was exposed to an amount of 200.144,56 pesos and, as its subject, it was referred to "the compensation of outstanding payments".
Penitentiary Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay to this supplier, which was followed by the Supreme Audit Office for the sale at high prices, another charge.
What hasn't been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many more checks will be sent to Camach Palazuelos.
"There was nothing bought now, only what we owed her, as did other suppliers," he said in one interview.
The last checks "revealed" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last on November 16.
Although this business has not yet been published in the Government's letter, as it states in the case of companies audited by the State Audit Office to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the cashier assured that the City Hall has not again used the services of the contractor.
in the past, after 25 July, he published a journal of Noroeste review of checks issued by the city hall to his suppliers, which revealed that during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camach Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos by 42 cheques in March 2008 to 9 July 2010.
It also carried out transactions with Jumaada, where it collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places necessarily need maintenance
Tourist managers complain in connection with an accident by a foreign tourist due to the poor state of the Sánchez Taboada estate in Mazatlán.
After the fall of the foreign tourists into the depths of Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlán is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places in poor condition and thus do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zone Dorada Traders Association, recalled that they repeatedly asked to care for the impression of the destination, and the bad that tourists find here to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He stated that the bad status of the streets and pavements is affecting tourists who are walking and seeing a mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"The politicians don't know what it's like to shut down the business for one day, and they have no idea about the sales they're missing, otherwise they wouldn't be dealing with these things for so long and without proper planning."
Hoteliér José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city hall.
"The directive will have to take responsibility and prevent such a repetition from happening, it will have to focus on preventive maintenance, not just correct existing defects", he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean town, because not only is it that we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, for even as residents we deserve a clean home, the town hall should change its strategy of urban maintenance".
There are other places that look neglected and pathetic, such as the Mazatan Emblém and El Venadito.
"Today, to arrive tourists, no matter only about promotion, we need to offer a good product, i.e. a city flowing with the purity of its beaches and streets, where permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out", he said.
"There was no need for attention, and these facts emphasize something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is missing.
He talked about a number of places that need to be arranged in cooperation with the City Hall, saying that the priority must be to keep the city clean and orderly, to be attractive because it has a tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a secretary of Tourist Promotion, has said that saving tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space, but it will be necessary first to make these places more attractive and to list them in the list that we have to promote this destination."
IP requests Congress's results
Eduardo Davalos, president of the CCE, would like Members to take great responsibility by setting an example in finding a better Sinaloy, in the various challenges facing the state.
The parliamentary period full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive requires the business sector in Mazatlán, because Sinaloa is being thrown in convulsions and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, composed of seven political forces, 19 MPs of PRI, 13 of PAN, three from the Party of Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the Convergencia side and the last from the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from new members of Congress is that they are able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party's and peternalist partners will not be repeated.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordination Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 Members of Congress take great responsibility and set an example on the way for the better Sinaloou in the various challenges it faces.
"We expect Members to exercise their right, without any agreement between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
He therefore referred to the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary overlap that would move the ruling forward in accordance with the order.
"We want them to do decent work and to be committed primarily to companies and sectors, because they were the people of Sinaloy who gave them their vote in past elections of trust".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to collect all the strengths to achieve the country's economic growth, because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is to encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way support job creation".
As regards tourism, he asked new legislators to give him greater weight in the framework of the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that this is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, which brings value and investment, which in addition directly competes with agriculture".
In addition, in order to spend the funds on tourist projects, Congress should help to provide the State with certainty and help with a law on alcohol that has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
The Three Kings Looking for
The dolls, cars and bicycles are together with other toys on the children's wish list in the Coronada Valenzuel family.
Their parents will find it difficult to fulfill their ideas about the coming festival of three kings, as their household is precisely 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them toys and clothes that they desire so much.
The family lives in a modest residence in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor circumstances, as the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes we're having a hard time, because our husband's not lucky, but we're selling Mandarins and potatoes... I'm going out this afternoon with the "stupids" on the street selling on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuel, Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wishes a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like Barbie's doll.
As for the 10-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesús would have wanted Cayethan's clothes of size for one year.
"I told me (José Alfredo) 'I would like this monster car', but I said to him 'I'll see my son because it was very expensive', recalls Cayetan's sorrow.
For older children who were just in school, it would be ideal for clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, has a size of 12, 10-year-old Isaacs size 10, whereas 8-year-old Miguel wears a size of 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan is missing his sneakers, so he could use a five-and-a-half-six couple.
To help fulfill the dreams of children of the Coronada Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Three Kings Looking for", and at the reception of Noroeste daily bring a gift or money in cash.
14 suspected drug dealers who have been arrested
The dozens of tours were carried out in Estonia, on Wednesday, in the course of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
Tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places that served to produce drugs.
"approximately 750 beds of Indian cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson in Quebec.
Eleven men and three women were arrested in total, of which both supposed bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Arrested persons must have come to Sherbrook's judicial palace after their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, holding it with the aim of trading it, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These tours took place following a long-term investigation, which took almost a year.
"It was information we received from the public and which enabled us to proceed to these arrests", said M. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers in the regional police department of the city of Estrie State Police of Quebec, the State Police in Sherbrook and the Sherbrook Police Administration of Memphrémagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The Conservatives Act, which, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships imposed by illegal immigrants, is clearly overcome, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday have reported that they cannot support it.
"I am leaning on the Chart by a significant measure."
"I stand straight on the side, which built a gall under your feet," said the liberal chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a week's meeting of the weekly du caucus.
The liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, would be in violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for up to one year.
The chief of the Quebeck Block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill because he was headed for the wrong goal.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," said M. Duceppe.
Critic of the NPD on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected critics who want her side not strong enough for illegal immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree to take measures against illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be the carrier of another bill, C-35", said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives Act because it blames refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year", explained Mrs Chow.
The Minister for Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties.
"Canadas are publicly telling Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that they're taking to Canada and they're treating it like some kind of stickling. "
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, to respond to Minister Kenney.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence in its draft law, which could lead the country to the elections leading to its rejection.
One Conservative told the QMI that the government will request a vote to have every Member who is opposed answer from his position in front of his voters.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the notification of the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public investigation committee on the issue.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, strives not to forget this idea: Québec intends to consult with the Department of Investment from New York on this issue in January next year.
Metropole has a permanent anti-corruption unit at its disposal since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcements of some of us were surprised.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Police Council in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was also present.
There was no need for a public security critic, PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to evaluate this announcement as "the mole pulled out of the hat" and "a amateur solution to be blown on the knee".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"He will be satisfied with the confirmation: you will see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public hearing witness hearing.
"Mr. Charest confirms that he does not want to create this investigation committee, and people think, like you and I, he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the establishment of an investigation committee is by demissioning Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of High State Officials.
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposed Quebek to grant a special mandate to the general inspector to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the term of office of the General Inspector," he decided.
He also considers that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners, who are allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in Charest's files.
Quebec would also change the Criminal Code after Ottawa so that it would be better adapted for this type of crime.
This requirement would be based on the Agent for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), which informed the Minister for Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the caselaw of this type of investigation is not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some amendments linked to this file.
During the Spring 2001 operation, which hit a group of bikers, although the Criminal Code had not yet been regulated, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gang Act.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several water flows have been under strict control due to heavy precipitations which have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, in Shawinigan, Mauritius, there was a landslide.
Two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's shifting.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening several regions hit a strong rainfall, i.e. it rained from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 further millimetres were not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sections in the north of the river and the Outauais valley were hit most.
It could drop up to 100 millimetres in there.
If we add up these snowfalls accumulated in some sectors, we may be afraid of floods in some water streams.
Quebek's rescue service announced a flood warning on Wednesday night for the river Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have become the subject of flood emergency and continuous control.
In the de Lanaudière area, strong declines in the distribution of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, as a result of heavy rains, one provisional bridge was removed.
Two residences must have been evacuated.
In Outaouais pouring out some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Rescue service has an emergency to oversee the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebeck Water Prophecy Center has issued a warning on Wednesday against strong floods for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamoval
Quebecký radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered partial failure in front of the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial comments on social assistance and Haitians and, as well as due to gross expression during the broadcast.
The Radio and Television Council considers that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "unexplained information on social assistance and inappropriately negative statements by the Haitians of gross expression which did not correspond to the broadcast broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussions on suicide, including the transmission of the names of the two people who took their lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Council received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Joint Front of the beneficiaries of the social support to Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts stated on the broadcast were imprecise.
The moderators must submit reliable information, not deceptive.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont believed that suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most of the members of the Commission concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission considers that the contested episodes of the broadcast of the "Dupont's midday news" have come across a delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate way."
No excuses have been brought against him.
The last dispute concerned the statement followed by the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort went into a media shootout that caused a lot of reactions.
The moderator CHOI stated that he had not sent any gift to help the Haitians, because we cannot be sure that the need will actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriately negative picture of the Haitians.
"I've already forgiven my three-day delay."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross speeches on the broadcast.
Anyway, CHOI-FM's radio broadcast was "over-the-counter"
For stations which, inter alia, have to notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung fuvà Montreal.
The Montreal population, originating in Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special course.
The athlete, which stands out in "Sanda" (ung-fu "full contact"), enters the dads and ringes of the world in Kickbox and Thai box, looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explaining to Zemmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches a little everywhere because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, there are rare competitions in North America."
Recently, this person who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS has just provided his opponents with bad news when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from October 23 to October 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the kickbox category full connect and the Thai box, he said."
"I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in San Shou."
"They were invited by rivals who ended up in the first four at the last World Cup in every category."
"In Toronto in 2009, I won a bronze."
"In 2005, I ended up eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China, I finished the tournament on the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third, delivered."
"It's interesting that I made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or this year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where punches with fists and legs, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
The matches are traditionally played on the platform and rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of struggle, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
While Nacer Zemmal has only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a nice guy."
"It's kind of equivalent to the Stade Lumpinee (most stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before he suffered a loss in the finals.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four rivals for the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The semi-finals will meet in the finale of their category."
"Then the winners of every category will meet so that the only champion, king of kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million without public competitions
Hydro-Québec agreed to 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this avalanche, more than 100 contracts are the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor Groupe, which has received the most significant contract, a contract to manage the entire project amounting to $295 million without a competition.
This consortium, on behalf of Énergie gérance, was in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for managing this significant hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005 the "Énergie gérance" consortium obtained a lucrative contract without any notice of the competition.
For the Quebec party, a complaint about a consortium of businesses is facing a serious ethical problem that risks preventing competition and causing price increases.
"It's a new way to implement collusion and eliminate competition."
"This means that people, who no longer make side agreements, are already making them openly today," said PQ Sylvain Simard yesterday at the press conference.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because it says it has a heavy bearing on how the public interest can be sold like this.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected this afternoon, irrefutably denying that it would be a collusion contract.
"I have my own path," she thundered and claimed that PQ was "respectful" and "deprived accuracy".
She said that "that would be the least of it" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice around the world.
It is usually an alliance, limited in time, which will allow two or more companies to group their mutual experts so that they can respond to the call for proposals for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complicated with regard to the complexity of the work.
The construction is already running and has to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; it was a trade.
It must also be acknowledged that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, a form of consortia in the field of engineering consulting is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we fly at the speed of the quebeck business register, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanently created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; let us name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are tens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
As regards the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the land of La Baie James is typical of the special dynamics of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), provided an explanation that will force us to throw our head over the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you're going to a contest and if there's not enough participants in the tender competition, your prices may be higher."
"You have two choices: that is, you'll pick up the people who stand in that contract as participants in the competition, and you'll say, "Let's make a deal that's satisfactory and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that it is not a price, but the competence of the people", confirmed Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Énergie Gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for over $50,000 received by the Quebek Party.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification of Le Devoir, 109 contracts for advice in the field of engineering concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular laboratories carrying out soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin sum of 22 contracts, of which Génivar obtained 16 of them, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a share in the "Énergie gérance".
All contracts have been concluded.
The total count is $449 783 344, including a contract with Énergie gérance at $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard indicated that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor Group) are "very good known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau released a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "finance" before she specified that it was rather her managers.
The barometer responsible consumption - "green" label does not give rise to trust
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebecký consumer very little trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as the 'unbiased' brands and environmental certification, in order to be guided in the selection of products.
Worst of all, although we buy in the media universe, which insists on us and encourages us to socially more responsible consumption, this media universe urges us to lack of reliable information, a failure to fulfil the duties that it qualifys even as a brake for its commitment, states the Baroque responsible consumption, the first article of which came out yesterday.
Although consumption of socially responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec who are trying to sell it have too much faith in them.
Two-thirds of us actually say that they don't believe the promises of companies dealing with the environment, simply because the green advertising of companies is finding the measuring tool that the Observatory has developed for responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates, attributed to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands, which are referred to as environmentally responsible, states Barometers.
In the same way, the policy debate on this subject is adopted as a serious mere 14.6% of the people of Quebec.
However, the responsible consumption information seems to be a priority in stimulating this consumption site, which is currently being brought to life by almost a third of the Quebetic consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would ease the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Baromètre at a higher price of these products.
After all, a third of the people of Quebekus are distrustful about the data we provide on products or the "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of the consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, change the brand of one or more products, thus responding to their beliefs.
61% of them preferred purchases from their district traders and preferred to purchase food from their region, says Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - the Homo consummus Québek likes to present himself as a king of recycling, which seeks the least possible environmental impact by caring for animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained outside their car, says Baromètre: in 2010, only 28% of the people of Quebec said they are using public transport or recommending the use of a car to drive at least two people, in order to protect nature.
The walk and the bike also supported 39.1% of the participants of this extensive survey of behavior that used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which we have asked for financial participation in the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a donation of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture to buy out the cinematographic complex on the Saint-Laurenta boulevard and which demonstrated its mission as a lover of film art, did not receive what she required.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose above would be lower, some was the original expectation that could lay the basis for viable solutions under favourable conditions and with resources coming from the State.
The first action plan and the requirement for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebek in spring last year, but the applications were revised to reduce.
The proposal and action plan were sent by Minister St-Pierre, President of the Society for Business Development in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's opposition came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of the gift from the State must really be rejected.
To remind us that the Association of Cinematographic Centers in Quebec was opposed to direct investment by the State in order to support the redemption of eXcentris, considering that the Minister of Culture is not to finance a real estate project when he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the debate requested substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, was given to his cinemas within ten years of financing the construction of the complex, which could have been a reason for a change by the State Financial Council.
The lack of halls for independent films is screaming in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to get a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, manages the campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will cut 700 000 dollars to push acquisition.
Since spring 2009, the only of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on 27 February next year and to show the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remind Le Devoir, and so he ignores himself, he and his group thought about the proposals for the reduction that he has been doing to him.
Raised curtain to Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic American springs mentioned in the knowledge through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of less valuable Canadians to Americans, but the same blow reveals their sense of superiority to Canada.
The US diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voters are at the heart of Canadian-American relations when they go to vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the conservative government to adopt its 2009 budget!
Four new messages, among which were the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday exclaimed to the public, provide additional sensitive details to get them "under the skin".
The Communication of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details how the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great amazement of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides a number of explanations for this situation.
"Canadian complex of underprices, almost stuck, mentions possible political leaders to talk about internal bets instead of realizing that these elections also concern the United States (as in the campaign on free trade in 1988) ", writes.
"The united states are therefore", concluded, "the proverbial elephant in these elections: all-inclusive, but potentially too threatening, rather than speaking of them."
The Ambassador understands this "absorbing silence" less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or even better leader of the party to manage these important relationships should be a key factor for voters to think about when they go to elections."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in the report, sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Brees, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government remains in the vote on trust at the beginning of February, relating to the federal budget to which Canada will publicly admit its first deficit in more than ten years, due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," writes M. Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to postpone Parliament's pre-Wealth meetings in order to avoid being defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties are subject to their survival by the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of an increasingly negative image that is being cast on the United States by the dramatic series broadcast on the CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O broadcasts, which can be observed not too sensitivistic references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or kidnappings for the purposes of violent interrogations at the CIA.
Another report reports that during their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some prisoners from Guantánam.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but based on the "case from the case" principle.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, a state secret."
"The Secrets accepted that the file would be revised."
Let us finally note that the people concerned by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, former advisor to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "destructed".
It was reported and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World Light Recovery Plan
Yesterday in Cancún, the UN proposed a plan to restore home lighting, lighting trades and industrial space in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse effect (GES), which is equivalent to almost one third of the further restriction to achieve the stability of the planet from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of the major specific projects that the UN wants to enforce in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-realised reduction commitments on the part of industrialised countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, if hot bulbs that monopolate 50 to 70% of the market, we replace fluo with compact light bulbs or, even better, light-emitting diode bulbs (DEL or LEDs) with a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would break down.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's the equivalent of 70% of the car fleet emissions on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, have taken part in voluntary reduction plans, which should allow the decrease of global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt will need to be deducted from this balance in order to achieve the stabilisation of climate heating to 2 degrees Fahrenheit by 2020, so that it can be ruled out that it will not get out of control.
In hot bulbs 95% of the energy is distributed in the form of heat and the rest is 5%, the product of light.
With the fluo compact bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new DEL bulbs, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluo compact bulbs last on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL light bulbs, which he put into Philips' production this week - this company reportedly participated in the UN study - have an estimated lifetime of 25,000 hours and consumes 80% less energy than a hot bulb, which gives us an idea of possible savings with a replacement plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new light bulbs can also work with the reostats and radiate less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed their reservations to fluo compact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, as long as the producers set up collections.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a compact fluo light bulb, but rather a thermal coal power plant that releases much mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in hot bulbs.
Only in the United States these headquarters put 25 000 tonnes of mercury into circulation per year.
The report also details the profits that each country would receive from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars per year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to 3,5 thermal power plants, which would cost 2.5 billion
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the results of the elections.
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadline set.
"The Secretary-General emphasises the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and immediately announce preliminary results, stressed the spokesperson of the United Nations."
"He asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the notification of the provisional results."
Despite the pressures of some foreign governments, the electoral commission had left the shortest date - Wednesday midnight - without publication, three days after Sunday's crucifixion.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI on TV confirmed that the committee was "going on to work" so that it could declare the results.
In the middle of the world, challenges were multiplied to finally declare the name of the winner of the second round, between Laurent Gbagbo and the member of the opposition of Alaska Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is relying on the cancellation of the Constitutional Council for a "successful" vote in the north, managed by the former insurgents of the New Army (FN) from the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters practiced by FN (New Army) in the north of the country have discouraged the supporters of President of Côte d'Ivoire from voting.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, the opponents of President Gbagbo consider that the supreme court of the country is not neutral because Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo, is running it.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who dementes any connection with the former insurgents, condemned the delay in the announcement of the results as "inadmissible" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, because he knows that he has suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to lodge a complaint to the Constitutional Council after he has prevented the electoral committee from broadcasting the results.
The second round of presidential elections, which took place on Sunday, was considered the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations pointed out in the middle of the political faction of Côte d'Ivoire that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, on October 31, as a winner with 38% of votes compared to 32% for Alaskan Ouattaru, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in the third quarter of France.
The unemployment rate in France under the words of the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas) as shown by the provisional data with the correction of seasonal deviations (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has reached 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year the unemployment rate is increased by 0.1 points.
In the wider picture, 3.4 million people in the metropolitan France are not working in the third quarter but would like to work, whether they are available or not in two weeks to work, and whether they are looking for or not.
The current situation of young people on the labour market was still rising with a new rise in unemployment rates of 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points per year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, there were 637 000 young people aged between 15 and 24.
As far as seniors are concerned, they recorded a slight rise in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months as per year), 482,000 people from 50 years above and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population benefitted from unemployment stability to 8.3% in the metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following the polemics of its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, is continuing to produce monthly statistics and announced a level of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) on Tuesday after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and held in custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the heads of the waste management companies and a brother of the PS Board of Administration Bouches-du-Rhône, was accused and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public procurement, presumably received.
Alexandre Guérini has been accused of abuse of the company's assets, abuse of public funds and public assets, covertization, provision of bribes, receipt of bribes to influence the office and possession of ammunition, states his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions he intends to ask him and not any delusions."
"It is easy to persecute him for many punishable reasons, but the other thing is to prove them," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, before questioning his client.
Mr Guérini stated through his lawyers that he had sent the judge a brief message before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but ensure that he was running the puzzle he was supposed to manage.
As regards the award of contracts or the destination of funds linked to their operation, he never knew anything about such a thing, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of Aubagne Agglomeration, was charged on Wednesday for the abuse of public funds and the compilation, and left him free, under judicial supervision with a ban on meeting, protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client was able to explain all the facts that were mentioned to him."
"The investigating judge looks into it and leaves it at large," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four more people were charged and released at night from Tuesday night on Wednesday, with the fact that they are under judicial supervision for two of them, said Deputy D.A. Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for receiving bribes in order to influence the Bureau and for passive corruption".
Two officers from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are accused, one for "the alienation and abuse of the company's assets", the other for "complot in the exploitation of public funds".
Finally, a business associate of Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "covering the abuse of the company's assets".
Among those who have been confronted by Mr Guérini, is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been accused in the parallel case of fraudulent public contracts concerning Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company that they helped to launder money from a vast gangsterry.
The investigation is conducted in several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public contracts, in particular on waste.
From the source of the near investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the Marseille city community (MPM).
The Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysian Palace exaggerated Syria's mediation
Over more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the allocation of the company's young researcher who was arrested in Iran for "spionage", united opinions in France, introduced diplomacy into a combat emergency and stressed the relations between Paris and Tehran.
All these diplomats from the United States have been closely monitored.
American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée Palace explained its strategy to Americans, while going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of young French women was not a compensation against the release for the freedom of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France and wanted American justice for the long-term trafficking of materials in favour of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they are subjected to sharp light by the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Clotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for it.
Diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris has a headline: "Iran:French comments on the way to solve hostages".
The advisor from the Elysian Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is speaking with the representative of American diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They recommend Americans to do just as much to bring their own nationals back to their country by violence detained in Iran.
"Do the noise," they say, "keep on saying "the words "the fundamental rights of man" in the media, "the innocence," "the immediate deliverance."
The Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, needs to be brought into difficulty.
"Do more than that, the more they ask you to stop."
Because attempts have been made to negotiate through discreet channels, "it solves nothing," the Iranians are "masters on evasive maneuvers".
Mr. Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "Iranian family tactics: taking hostages for "political blackmail".
It announces that the release of Klatilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, on the day of the French Embassy's refuge) "will request payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (a deposit of EUR 230 000).
And they're going to announce that the Elysei Palace's anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that's going to grow.
The Iranians could "take up more than 1,800 French people living in Iran in the future," he says.
August 28, 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
The information is spread: Iran Majid Kakavand, of which the United States claims to have been banished for illicit trafficking in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released for freedom in Paris on the basis of a decision of the judge.
As well as many observers, the US Embassy is asking about this worrying consensus.
For Washington, who pursues illegal Iranian networks to obtain nuclear material, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
France acceded to a contract?
Liberation of Iran for the liberation of a young French woman?
During the next interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier assures that it is not so.
The Elysian palace, as it states, was not only "contributed by this decision" but sought the opportunity to oppose it.
"There have been talks between the President's Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court", notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakaveand is under the "mere" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The advisor to the Elysian Palace dials the phone number, hangs up the phone earphone and then informs the American diplomat that Iran is currently in the buildings of Paris administered by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of Klotilda Reiss' imprisonment in Iran, the Elysian Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communications and organised "outbreaks" to the media to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing the "significant" and "influence" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and state that manipulation bears its fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 provokes the media "blest" of French officials.
What such a level of gratitude is based on is expressed in relation to M. Assad, he asks the Embassy in Paris.
"In spite of their statements, the French officials in private recognize that they only have vague ideas of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons which forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "directs President Sarkozy's policy validation to open up Syria", he analyses.
The policy applied in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and identified as premature and undeserved".
By "how overlying the Syrian role," Paris tries "to demonstrate to Syria what praisers can earn when playing a constructive role in the area".
The aim is also "to sow the grain of dissertation between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows it from a very good source.
August 11, François Richier confessed to him: "We obviously don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But yet we thanked them."
"That should at least bring confusion and confusion between the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts her at the Elysian Palace.
In the communication, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our countrywoman".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Peciwalský", which will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, provided responsible government officials.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December in order to request companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight for persons under 16 years, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", said Jo Rin, head of the Ministry, who has a proposal for a law of concern.
On-line games will be now available from 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, to clarify.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents will ask for it, complete the responsible worker.
It will also make free programmes available to those who request it, enabling them to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "disabled" countries and the daily press regularly brings various facts associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is an undeniable champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, a face in the face of 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
Full unrest due to suspected corruption is established by Fif's Executive Committee on Thursday of the World Cup host country in 2018 and 2022, the choice of politically motivated, where fighting for influence and lobbying risk ahead of technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the Royal Fif competition in 2018 will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping that it will be able to conquer the new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the 2010 African continent premiere, or continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities to participate in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leaders of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives you the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political bets around the world.
Negotiations behind the scenes face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
It is difficult for the rest to establish hierarchy according to candidates.
According to Fif's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portugal documentation (2018) and the American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons won't have too much weight for 22 members of the executive committee at an hour to vote.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the apparition leading to suspension of two members of CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temaria et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chances of its country, the dome which so far hosted the world championship only once a year.
The BBC set it up on Monday, when they broadcast a document that "tagged on the pin" three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fif dissatisfy and bring England’s leading leader to the forefront of David Cameron.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will succeed in repeating the move led by his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 managed to obtain for London an organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new shine to her name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, since the Spanish-Portugal couple do not miss the trumpets of already prepared stadiums, its prosperity (the World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the payment eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the championship would not be transferred to Zurich and publicly declared "an inconclusive competition in the preparation of the vote", in the words of the words barely twisted to the accusations of the English press against members of the CE (European Commission).
"We're going to throw mud at them, we're going to try to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022, they appear to be the logical favorite of the United States with its extensive 1994 experience.
The highest performance of the world economy, the headquarters of Fif's main sponsors, seems to have a great lead in front of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have made a beautiful project.
But these candidacy seems premature for both countries, which together in 2002 passed the "test".
Another threat: the 2026 World Cup in China, which Fif warmly wishes, made Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar, who pulled a big ace out of his sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fif would continue her expansion to new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for TV chatty fees (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, creating the momentum for Fif.
Second mandate: clarity (certainty)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand made it appear he's weighing.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The Mandate of the Elysian Palace is calling someone else.
The current Head of State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of the secret associated with the Presidency's function.
It is therefore necessary to act as if the doubts persist.
In one way or the other.
In 2006, without believing, the friends Jacques Chiraca made their demands that the third mandate should not be excluded.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy made sure that he "decided sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As he reminds before the members of the Parliament of the UMP on Wednesday evening in the Elysian Palace, the perspective of the two mandates has soaked little fever.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year term terms to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not a statement.
It's not the first time he reminds the presidential election of such a humorous tone at such meetings.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you still have seven and a half years ahead of you with me", he passed in July 2009.
The rebellion in May 2010: "Do not think that I do not consider the next stage."
His earlier statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; he will not make him a candidate or less.
If they call for comments, it is because of double truth.
Accelerate the path to the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to the Ségolèn Royal, which is pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to arrange into combat formations rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
Firstly, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy before Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and we don't discuss the matter with the UMP," they reacted immediately and suspiciously to the nearest neighborhood of the Prime Minister.
"If they believe a possible defeat, they will not run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe that he can win," repairs Alain Juppé, balanced with the obvious.
Euro: The Central European Bank has been forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of Centrals in the year should be an opportunity to specify the conditions for removal from the crisis or, at least, a notification of the cessation of the large number of unusual monetary policy operations to be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European claims is bound by the Institute for the issuance of securities, without a doubt, cannot afford to be so categorical under the threat of a deterioration of the situation today already so tense in European securities markets.
In that case, the political price would be higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in addressing the crisis in the claims of European countries.
She did not want to say whether she thought the bank could do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners...".
In the evening before, in Brussels, in his hearing with the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear more eloquent about its intentions and satisfied that the programme for purchasing state titles in the secondary market "gos hand in hand" and that "we will see how we will decide" during the meeting held this Thursday.
One certainty: The Central European Bank will guard its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of bonds made by the Central European Bank in the last week have doubled to almost EUR 1.35 billion.
And thanks to the misunderstandings of the agreementors on the market, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have bought EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There are no doubts between the contractors on the market for the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists expect no significant change of course.
If the operations of loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the Central Bank, the latter bank shall proceed to the unlimited provision of liquidity under generous conditions and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine she'd change her program in a significant way."
"If it hadn't, it would have meant taking the risk of a short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, Economist of Commerzbank.
"The progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", explains Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To the plan of its public debt market interventions, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchasing its bonds in order to reinvigorate the weak market", adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, there is no more choice than to maintain its presence on the market.
"He needs to replace at all costs the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the insurgency of the paid performances of the states, which are among the most fragile," the major bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates take off, the countries will be more concerned about reducing their debt rather than stabilising it.
It is saving the euro for this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi's backs
After the beginning of the week for Italy’s worrying situation was a bit relaxed, yesterday with a reverse flow of bond interest for 10 years.
Back to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs of the Regions, they said that they heard Giulia Tremonti qualifying the situation as "undissolvable" and that he expected a "unforeseeable" weekend, which he then attended demented.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest reached a record of 210 basic points and the price of contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk (CDS) fell to 263 points, which caused some disruption in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the derogation with German interest was higher than 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, has declared himself "too busy" "a stormy development of markets" and a possible disease from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clear and without encryption, its problem is the absence of growth and unremarkable fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and exposes the state to the risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is expected from now on to 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the deficit of public finances will still account for 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (compared to 3.9% of the government envisaged) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From here on, the reputation of a new summary of the additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after holidays, of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new stringent measures will have to be taken", says Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For the moment, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The basic stones of her economy are fine and her calculations are correct, we repeat it for a long time", assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian member of the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, nor short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product 2011, NDLR), efforts to stabilise the required in Italy are less than the efforts required from other countries", notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the main economist of the OCDE.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face the proposal to put forward a mistrust to the Chamber of Deputies and then they could start organising elections that are expected at the end of March.
Thus, a period would begin, which is insufficient to take a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde stressed it again yesterday at the press conference in Paris: "I think Europeans demonstrated it on Sundays all day and night, clearly very solidarityful determinations, committed to defend their currency and their monetary zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion, relating to interest on European government bonds, brought water to the mill to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's Authority has announced that it could degrade the Portuguese debt record, a target that is most focused on various speculations.
"Because in May the policy is not sufficiently transparent and clear, consisting mainly of banking systems", says the economist Exane BNP Paribas.
The more that "political time runs slower than market time".
The sciences of this intermittent context and the danger that it hides are invigorating European countries to strengthen existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected, and on a broader scale with their counterparts from the G20, are developing very well.
This is due to the Eurogroup's meetings (Eurogroupe) and the Ecofin group from the beginning of next week.
The Central European Bank is meeting today.
The programme is the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Finance Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, prevented a trip to Asia on Tuesday in Singapore, with a view to informing investors from the Far East of the development of the crisis in Europe.
If this path is not aimed at raising funds, it prepares the land to achieve this objective.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, the US official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in mobilised funds by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
Countries which are primarily concerned, Portugal and Spain are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are attached to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid other than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at all costs, asking for international assistance before they apply their own budgetary corrections and decide the structural reforms necessary to regain lasting confidence.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to accelerate the process of normalisation of sovereign markets.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea of not enough EUR 750 billion to be mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to touch the stock of securities again.
The Barclays Capital economists, who is the actor of the very first trading plan with European sovereign claims, consider that an addition of around EUR 100 billion would be enough, "the council" in the form of direct financial liquidity.
The measure exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidized to this day by EUR 60 billion.
The Council, which has every chance of being tried in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and snow: 24 regions have an orange emergency.
Snow allocations still create difficulties in transport, especially on the second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that some economic activities will be disrupted.
Twenty-four counties now have an orange emergency due to the risk of snow and hunting.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, joined 20 districts already declared orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, considerable snowfalls cause problems in the north of La Gironde and Les Charentes and are weakly snowed on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and covers from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
Charente counties, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are provided.
Snowfalls are large enough to cause problems in transport and disrupt certain economic activities, predicts Météo France.
On the coast of the Côtes d'Armor, some districts banned the passage of heavy freight transport - trucks above 7.5 tonnes with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
Road traffic on the second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police officers and the police recommend driving with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some truck has been discontinued for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardia on Thursday.
No special measures are envisaged on Wednesday evening to limit freight transport.
The District Office "Calls all car drivers to the greatest possible caution on roads and to adapt the nature of the road".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights to Roissy Airport in Paris and 10% to Orly due to expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services be contacted by their companies.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport is closed until Thursday in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernization of transport at Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
We are reminding, in particular, the 23 billion to the Grand Paris Metro to build Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the State announced a subsidy of EUR 4 billion.
It is simply theoretically an amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source for the contract.
Today, we are finally getting to the first additions.
The 2010 Rectification Act on Finances, which is examined by the National Assembly Financial Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms laid down to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax on equipment and increasing tax from offices to Ile-de-France.
One, we read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The return on this interest is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the rate of office for which it already exists, "to be modernised in order to increase the income obtained from Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that take?
A delusion.
It's not defined in the text.
We're four billion away.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are linked to EUR 4 billion from the capital subsidy, which will be mobilised by the State and inserted into Société du Grand Paris according to the project", we can read in an explanation of the reasons.
This system does not seem shocking to us at SGP.
"From the moment we created income (both taxes, ndlr) we can cover studies for three years and then cram into 4 billion, it is explained."
"This will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
SGP considers that 4 billion will be attributed in 2013 only to the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the four promised billions belong to absent subscribers, riskes creating a somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be December 7th.
vengeful hackers and vindictive scouts
The WikiLeaks case has dual significance.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal, a scandal that seems to be only a scandal in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, he talks about profound changes at international level and presents the future controlled by regression.
But let's move on with the order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
"The extraordinary revelation" of Americans about the way in which Berlusconi's sex life has been reported for months what everyone has read in any newspaper (all except these two Berlusconi own), and the indiscriminate caricature profile of Kadafi has long been a theme for the cabaret artists for sketches.
The rule that classified documents may consist only of reports already known is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to the bookstore, which is devoted to esoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats (about Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Temples or Zednařich) exactly what has been written in previous works.
And that's not only because the author of the occult texts doesn't like looking for new information (not knowing where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who take care of the occult believe only what they already know and confirm what they've learned before.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same goes for classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or limited spirit) Head of Secret Service (and if he is not, he could, as I know, be a editor in the newspaper Libération), who considers it true only what he himself will admit.
Information with high secrecy about Berlusconi, which the U.S. Embassy sent to the State Ministry, was the same information Newsweek published the week before.
Why, then, have there been so much fuss about these documents around the apparition?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can telephone or fly off by plane for a joint dinner, has lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few little exercises in representation, have transformed into espionage centers.
Any viewer watching movies about the investigation is very well aware that it seems to ignore it.
However, the fact that it repeats itself in public, shameful duty of hypocrisy and casts the wrong light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most strictly classified information in the world is a hard hit, not a negligible one, for the prestige of this State Ministry.
The scandal affects both the victims and his "contractor".
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once upon a time in Orwell's day, it was possible to assume all the power, like some Big Brother, who controlled every move of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been demonstrated since, thanks to the ability to control every move through the phone, every transaction made, every hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, has become a citizen of the ultimate sacrifice of the wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now, that even the "powders" with the most classified information of the mighty cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a jogger.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker, elected as a avenger of a citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can you maintain power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is an unobtrusive secret (and the unobjective mystery will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is a truly secret, because it is drawn from the public life; but reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was unobstructed secrets, means taking away all his power.
WikiLeaks did not make a mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this wound be of such great power?
Clearly, in the future, states will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be equal to its publication on a poster on the corner of the street.
But it is also perfectly clear that with current technologies it is unnecessary to hope that you can keep your message secret on the phone.
It is not easier to find out if and when the head of the state traveled by plane and joined one of its colleagues.
How can they be kept in private and sensitive news in the future?
I know that for now my prognosis belongs to science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who carry discreetly the fulfilment of formalities on uncontrollable routes and carry only those reports that know memories or rather hide rare information in the heel of the shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in key drawers: overall, the attempt to espionage in the Watergate are less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, which means backwards.
One century after a wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Videotapes (analogs) allowed cinema lovers to take a step-by-step film, move it back and forth, and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, while now CDs (numbers) only allow them to jump through chapters, that is, macroporians.
Through the quick train, we will arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the way by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is not unusual, therefore, that policy and communication techniques will return to cars loaded with horses.
Last comment.
Other times, the press tried to understand what was happening in the secret of the embassy.
They're now embassies asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked her promises to finance
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try and try to respect the promises of fast-closure financing (a said early start financing (a fast start) or early start), implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were exposed
In the Copenhagen Agreement, advanced countries have undertaken to provide $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion for three years and France € 1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU pulled out a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to financing fast start: a report clarifying the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation underrated and valued: advanced countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, bringing it on the right track to keep its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without harming the public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no match in what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding has been maintained and it adds 150 million to it for three years the title of fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment terms or with deadlines at the level of public aid for development.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of all new projects in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditures of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide publicque au développement.
In particular, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decline), it is intended to comply with its commitment to finance "new and additional"...
Another crucial element is the division into donations and loans.
There is no rule yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ borrowed is equal to 1€ donated.
Clearly, this is hard to prove: efforts are not comparable.
If the use of loans can be documented for certain investments that are profitable (sometimes projects linked to emission reductions, based on more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we will receive as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not understand it by virtue of our commitments, but as the cost of the loan to the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rates).
But France can only give such a justification: "he's respecting" his commitment of EUR 420 million, which makes this 91.5% of the loan (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of the donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses a loan on such a scale.
Germany has requested 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (between others) comply with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union gives 1€ to meet its promise, France will only give 10 cents and consider this effort to be comparable.
A beautiful chicler's piece!
For a summary, in its financing "fast start," France operates with double shrapnel: on the one hand with the development of stock in time and on the other hand with real financial burden.
Although it only publishes EUR 36.1 million, it can convince that it issues EUR 420 million "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate when it is enough to lend?) and when negotiating because developing countries are not entirely naive...
Early funding is only a small question, relatively short, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be a grain of sand in an enormous machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw the knowledge from this first year of early financing.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and dignity and justice towards the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should prevent the discussion of deposits in long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the way in which loans are settled.
France should change its position in order to become as progressive with these deposits as others.
So, everyone's hopes are putting into the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciasko-Morizet, who is coming to Cancuna next week.
A surprising announcement of France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could result in an increase in the level of international trust necessary to allow further discussion.
An alarm about pesticides that the kids see.
A ten-year-old child dies one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Hand of Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The Association, which points out that its results "do not have significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the problem being processed", bought four meals and one light meal for one child about ten years old in L'Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as sugar confectionery, were analysed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is crushing: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are listed as carcinogenic, possible or likely substances, and five substances belong to clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances which could act as disruptive for glands with internal mixing (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we see that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminating substances, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking", reports the association.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain about ten residiums with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as well as for about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, presented as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including, among other things, France, a prohibited fungicide.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya included in lunch, where studies have discovered traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, the ground meat buffet, the canned tuna and even the mushrooms and the gum were plucked pesticides and other chemicals.
The presence of nitrates and chloroform has been detected in the tap of the analysis.
Steak from salmon to dinner was the "richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to warm up food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this "contamination cocktail" is likely to be underestimated", results from the study.
The Ecological Europe-Greening Association (EE-LV) designed "to create a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the growth of civilizational diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) study examined the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereal.
