The members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will "look like Mupeti"
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are consterned by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal are plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Velšský Parliament.
The members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could be a joke.
One member of the Labour Party stated that his group was concerned that "this is rhyming with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
On the other hand, Plaid said that the group, as a whole, was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
However, Velšské conservative said that his group was going to change the name "with an open mind", but noted that MWP was close to Muppet's word.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced in the same way as the letter "u" in York.
The assembly committee, which is now preparing legislation to introduce a change of name, said: "The final decision on what members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be on members themselves."
The law of the Flemish Government of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public meeting on proposals where wide support was given a option to call the Velš Parliament meetings.
As regards the title of assembly members, the commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or the WMP, but the MWP variant received the largest support in the public discussion.
The members of the assembly apparently propose alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus can bring concern to President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a proposal for legislation within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members and a proposal for a system of committees.
The members of the Assembly will vote on their title in the framework of the new legislation.
Macedonians will vote on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
Any vote should be resolved for decades by a dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a claim to the Greek territory and repeatedly protest against applications for EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the plebisticity for a change of name, said that he would not follow the vote.
The referendum advocates, including the Prime Minister of Zoran Zaev, however argue that a change of name is simply a price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be quiet because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival.
“The old people I spoke to say with them say that he was earlier at every corner of the bar and church,” says Mr. Adams.
"There's no one there today."
He thinks the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People meet in a different way today," he says.
"Bears are no longer living in a neighborhood where people go regularly."
As for the churches, he fears that money from the sale of assets will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started. ”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such type of people who don't help the remaining saints in the quarter.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” she says, “and so soon the day will come when these churches close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches.”
Both churches built a white congregation before it became a black metropolis from Harlem – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the Black Congregation, whose piety took place nearby.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise blacks.
The fire in 1939 damaged the building strongly, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered a bell.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell "the call of the poor".
The professional who played the bell in July called it "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted that it was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a bigger bell at the church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him with St. Martin.
In the last few months, the complicated story of architects and builders was held at St. Martin's, some of which were called by laymen of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
In July, the Council of Elders, the head of the parish body, composed of laymen, sent a letter of concern that the Diocese “will try to advance costs” to the council of the elders, although the hiring of architects and builders who had sent the Dioceses did not participate in any.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old boy who was sinking for lobsters in California.
According to the official report, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived for lobster on the start of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place in the morning shortly before 7 o'clock near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he fell to him with the whole group to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that the call first considered the joy of the lobster catch, but then “he realized that he was shouting ‘He took me!
He bit me!"
When Hammel got to the boys, he noticed that “he had the entire area of the collarbone torn apart. ”
“I shouted that all of them should go out of the water: “There is a shark in the water!” says Hammel.
The boy was in critical condition transported by helicopter to the hospital of the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles, at the press conference, said the shark was seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
Authorities for investigation and security closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that more than 135 sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's wants to stand up to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic alleys in the style of a business house where specialised sales will be available.
As part of a strong entry into the cosmetic market in the UK, which is worth 2,8 billion pounds, and it continues to grow while fashion and domestic needs are being sold, the streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores all over the country.
Investment in cosmetics is associated with the efforts of supermarkets to find uses for shelfes that were previously used for televisions, microwaves and home needs.
Sainsbury's states that it will double the size of the range of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and will first mention brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also get the existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands thanks to branded places like Boots.
The supermarket also reiterates its range of make-up Boutique, so most of the products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, in two shops Saintsbury’s will be testing concessions of retail perfumes Fragrance Shop. The first such store was opened in Croydon in the south of London last week and will be created in Selly Oak in Birmingham this year.
Online shopping and moving towards daily shopping of small amounts of food in local stores means that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
The CEO of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that stores will increasingly look like stores, because the chain of supermarkets is trying to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount dealers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened hundreds of stores in Argos and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are chains that he bought two years ago, which have increased the sales of food and acquisitions are so much more profitable.
The previous attempt at a supermarket to transform the separation with a cosmetic and pharmaceutical range ended in infamous.
At the beginning of the Millennium Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the connection ended after the argument on the distribution of proceeds from drug sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold his 281 pharmacies for £25 million to Celesio, who owns the chain of pharmacies Lloyds.
Lloyds is planning to play his part by adding an extended range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
The business director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We changed the look and style of the streets with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all needs and an attractive environment and a favourable location mean that now we are an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change old shopping methods."
Peter Jones is "breathed" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the 11 million pounds contract.
Star Dragons Day Peter Jones "Worm" after TV moderator Holly Willoughby resigned from a contract worth $111 million with his lifestyle to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their branded clothes and accessories Truly.
The business of this couple was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow actress.
A seventy-year-old moderator of the show announced that she was going to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby enraged the star of Dragons Day Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV at the last minute.
According to the informational sources, Jones “wieldered” when a television star, during an intense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to the new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, would no longer be able to devote enough time to their trademark of home clothes and accessories to Truly.
The company was compared to Goop Actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of moderator Willoughby in an estimated £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37-year-old in Instagram, announced that she was leaving Truly, Jones went from Britain to one of her summer homes.
The unnamed source states: “Truly’s brand was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would secure her for decades.
Her decision to leave was absolutely shocking.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold in Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of the hostess of this Morning, which is one of the most important British stars, could cost the company millions due to a fat investment in pillow products and candles to clothing and home clothing and possibly another delay in branding.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and two-year-old Jones joined as chairman of the board in March.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become an ambassador to the M&S brand and replace Anta McPartlin with the moderation of I'm and Celebrity on ITV.
The source close to Jones last night said, "We're not going to comment on his business."
The difficult behavior "and then we fell in love"
He used to joke about the criticism that some journalists gave him as a comment that some considered to be "neighborhood president" and how he spoke positively about North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his mocking “voice” voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump appreciated as a big step towards the denuclerisation of North Korea, Kim was interested in further meetings.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have been put at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the major North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" for its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
That would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, according to him, brought positive results – ending the rocket tests, helping to free the hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers to their country.
And he defended his unusual access to information about Kim's relationship.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside into this master arena, we should have about 200 people standing right here,” said Trump and showed him to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake waves in Indonesia destroyed the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the people of Lomboku were banished from their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a little difficult,” says Mrs Subbung.
The Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel can work here.
The spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutupo, said that the Indonesian activists are evaluating the situation in Paul to see if international organisations will be allowed to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the earth on the wrath of Mother Nature is still unrelentingly unprepared.
Although shelters against tsunami were built in Aceh, it is not common on other parts of the coast.
The loss of human lives is likely to have contributed even to the apparent lack of sirens warning in Paul against the tsunami, even though the warning was given.
Even at the best of times, travelling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship anchored in Lombok and helped the victims of the earthquake is now moving to Paula, but it will take at least three days for him to get to the scene of the new squid.
Improving poor Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widoo's election campaign, and the president spent a lot of money on the roads and railways.
Next year, he's going to try again to get elected, but his government is under pressure for outages in financing.
President Joko also faces pressure from the persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, when the Muslim majority accept a more conservative form of faith.
The street fights between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and tens of thousands of people driven out of their homes.

The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has recently become a hit because of an argument about "prescription of history"
His extermination would be a well-deserved punishment for destroying many of the English cultural and religious artifacts of the Taliban - style by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has called Mr Crick's proposal "a foolishness" and "a desire to rewrite history."
President Cromwell Society John Goldsmith points out: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would become one of the goals in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or perform an iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the acts of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent work of Cromwell, the author of which is Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century's view and part of the history of the character, which many think still deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although today a little less than at the end of the 19th century, to defend Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unscrupulous historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a well-identified figure that represents one side of this division.
His success as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and reminding."
A killing pig tore up a Chinese farmer
According to local media information, there was an assault and killing of a farmer by a pig in the South-East China market.
As South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man named only the surname "Yuan" was found dead with a cut artery in a pool of blood near the pigs in the market in Liou-pchan-chuy in the province of Kuej-cha.
The pig breeder is being prepared to apply the vaccine to pigs in the pigs on 30 May 2005 in Si-ning, China, in the province of Qing-ji.
Apparently, on Wednesday, he and his cousin came from the province of Jünnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out the door to the side of the shed was open.
According to him, there was a big pork in the pigs with a mouth of blood.
According to information, during the forensic examination it was confirmed that he tore the farmer's 250-pound pork.
“The brother had the legs of blood and torn apart,” quoted the daily Guiyang Evening News cousin, which he calls the surname ‘Wu’.
The security footage shows Yuan coming to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animals that killed a man were neither Yuan nor his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so that no one else could be attacked when the police were gathering evidence at the crime scene.
Market officials reportedly talk to Yuan's family about compensation for his death.
The attacks of pigs on humans are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts and critically wounded a man.
Ten years earlier, 300 kg of pig squeezed the Welsh farmer to the tractor and drove him away to the farmer's wife.
After eating his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News station that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a "breather".
“They’re just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them enough respect," he said.
The remains of hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the south-west of the USA
Hurricane Rosa, as predicted, is going down and moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, the flood rains will bring to North Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
At 5 o'clock in the morning of Eastern time, Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h, representing hurricane category 1, located 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, when Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will form a tropical storm and start pushing tropical humidity northward into the southwestern part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
The tropical humidity then, with the approach of low pressure in the following days, causes massive rains in the south-west of the United States.
Precipitations of 25 to 100 mm locally will cause dangerous floods, suture currents and possible landslides in the desert.
A strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation to be close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the south-west of the USA, especially above most Arizona, precipitation is expected at 50 to 100 mm.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions, floods may occur due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
Due to the danger of tropical precipitation, it would be very unreasonable to walk into the desert.
A strong rain can cause canyons to become raging rivers, and storms will bring locally impacted winds and floating dust.
The approaching low pressure line will bring a strong local rainfall on some parts of the coast of southern California.
A total rainfall of more than 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller streams of rubble and slender roads.
It will be the first rainfall period in this region.
On Sunday night and Monday morning, a unique tropical rush will begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday night, and on Tuesday, the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to Four Horns and last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes throughout the United States, because the Arctic begins to cool down, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to rapid temperature changes at short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahou in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa there is a difference of almost 11 degrees Celsia.
In the next few days, they will try again to expand the protruding summer heat.
In most territories in the center and east of the USA, a warm start of October is expected with temperatures of about 27 °C from the southern plains to the north-east of the United States.
There could be 27 °C in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of excessive temperatures in the US east in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation followed over 20 million people
More than 20 million people were watching on six television channels a Thursday-long, enticed statement by a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual assault that occurred in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate continued, and the announcers interrupted the current programs with reports of sudden Friday's revolution: the agreement that the Senator for Arizona Jeff Flake had facilitated, that the FBI would carry out a one-day investigation of charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate's committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was touching her at a high school party drunk and trying to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in his exhilarated statement that he's 100% sure he didn't.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were observed by the Nielsen Agency.
The company calculated the average ratings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for other stations that broadcast messages such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not available immediately.
And Nielsen is usually having trouble counting people who are looking at offices.
For comparison, it's similar to the number of viewers watching football matches in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the greatest ratings of all stations when Nielsen followed him on average during the day-to-day hearing.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2,52 million viewers.
Interest continued even after the end of the negotiations.
The main figure of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After this moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying that she would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught them screaming at him when he was about to take the elevator to the courtroom hearing.
CNN was handing over live how he stood with his eyes down for a few minutes and had to swear.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you."
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power while many women are helpless. ”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later broadcast live when the jury was to vote on presenting Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by interviews with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without an investigation the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of being "politicians" with regard to Rexita.
In an interview for the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of leaving the European Union of "politicians" regarding the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was close to the Prime Minister on the front, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose their duties on each other was "excessive".

Sopka fires on Mexico City
The ashes that are rolling from the Popacatepetl volcano hit the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The national disaster prevention centre on Saturday warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the Vulcan activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Centre's been watching a number of peanuts and quakes.
On social networks, pictures of windscreen cars covered with a thin layer of ash in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in volcano activity, which is located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital city. The last earthquake shaken to central Mexico in September 2017 and had a force of 7.1 degrees.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the vote on independence, the police met with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protesters for independence met with the order police and thousands were involved in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence that divided Catalonia.
The fine officers blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint at them, the ones on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists, created a dark cloud of dust.
Later on, there were also clashes, which the police needed to use the truncheons to calm down.
In a few hours, the independent groups sang “We Will Not Forget,” in the face of protesting union supporters who called “Let Spain live.”
According to the local press, 14 people were easily injured in protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate it, tension remains high in an independent region.
The voters voted for independence for the majority, but the participation in the elections was low because the opponents of the disbarkation boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to close the vote in the electoral rooms in violent clashes throughout the region.
The independence support groups remained outside on Friday night to prevent the demonstration from supporting the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
The eighty-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for independence for Catalonia.
“ Last year, we had one of the best moments.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we're in a dead end," he said.
Despite the important, although close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties in support of independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either went to exile themselves, or they are waiting for the court for their participation in the organisation of referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
A 20-year-old montister Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone and said that the conflict was blown up by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“The European elections can be selected as the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and repression that we are witnessing by the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after a car crash into the house
Three men 33, 34 and 39 years old were imprisoned after they repeatedly hit the Londonderry house by a car.
The event happened at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, maybe someone shot the car from a crossbow.
Mengova's shot secured Livingston's victory 1-0 over Rangers
First goal of Dolly Mengy for Livingston guaranteed victory
Livingston, who advanced from the lower division, shocked Rangers and awarded Steven Gerrard only a second defeat from 18 matches as club manager from Ibrox.
The hit by Dolly Mengy turned out to be decisive when Gary Holt's team reached the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team hasn't won this season in the Premiership League and the first Hearts to lose eight points will be built next Sunday.
Before Thursday, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League.
Livingston extended a number of games without defeat in the division to six games, so the head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, hasn't yet tried defeat.
Livingston didn't take any chances against the insignificant guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal, because his directness caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he failed at the gate, then Alan Lithgow just missed Craig Halkett's head in the slide.
Domestics just watched the Rangers play before them because they knew they could poison the guests with standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against the Rangers was ordered a free kick and Livingston created a crack, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sent Mengu, which the ball in the center of the fine territory flowed and scored.
At this stage the Rangers dominated in holding the ball, but the home defense was impenetrable for them and goaltender Liam Kelly mostly didn't have much work to do.
The same picture of the game was also in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman stopped the goalie Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow from another standard livingston situation.
There were constantly centers flying into Livingston’s penitentiary territory, and there were two penalt kickes – after Halkett’s attack on Deputy Glenn Middleton and another hand.
"Fenomen" from Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were outstanding and still overcome expectations on their way up.
Their game style and team have almost changed since returning to the top, but great praise deserves Holt for the way the team rebelled out since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, he was leading a great deal of orderly defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert all the time.
Rangers are lacked inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't reach these standards anymore.
Their tip was lame – only once they penetrated the home – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan had a mixed arrival in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29) for breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and everyone smiled.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to correct the relationship between NATO allies.
They have not agreed on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and the admission of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
In this city, Turkey's largest population is outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people were also heard – many of them were Kurds – protesters against Erdogan, who condemned his policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the controversiality of the visitor, which some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed like autocrats.
An accident in Deptford: A cyclist died after a hit with a car
A cyclist died in London after a hit with a car.
An accident occurred at approximately 10:15 local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street with the busy Evelyn Street in Deptford on the south-east of the city.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived early, but the man was dead.
A few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the site of Saturday’s tragedy in an accident on Childers Street, when the driver left the site.
Metropolitan police said that policemen are now trying to identify and inform their relatives.
The road is closed, buses run on alternative routes and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin: Six guards were injured in the riots
According to the prison's office, six guards were injured during the riots in a men's high security prison.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and still last.
Eight prisoners in one wing were called by specialised overseers from the Tornado team to handle the riot.
The overseers suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
Prisoner said: “To handle the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison workers were put in place.
Six personnel were treated with injuries.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence, and it is clear that those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and may spend longer in prisons."
There are over 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was announced that the director of the prison ended up in the hospital after the inmate was attacked.
And last October, they were called to the prison by the Orders because of the serious unrest that attacked the staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the floods of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (a area where it is dry can benefit)
It is not customary for Arizona to hit the tropical low pressure, but that is probably what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and brings the risk of flood floods.
National weather service has already issued warnings against floods on Monday and Tuesdays from Western Arizona for south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including cities like Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday night and bring rain on Monday night.
On Twitter, the National Weather Service in Phoenix reported that “from 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained their status as a tropical storm or pressure below!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona places up to 150 mm.
In other parts of the desert northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Big Pan, it is likely to drop 25 to 50 mm, with local totals of up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the area hit dry.
The floods are a very serious thing, but these precipitations may help somewhere, because the Southwest of the United States has just hit dry.
Server weather.com states that according to U.S. Drought Monitor, Arizona is experiencing more than 40% at least "extreme dry", which is the second highest category.
The journey of hurricane Rosa will lead first to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about the power of hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then Sunday morning it will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and it will travel at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and thus lose power.
It is expected that they will arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, the fall will be strong, which represents a high risk of flooding.
“In the area from Baja California to the northwest Sonor, a total rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected, with up to 250 mm possible,” says the server weather.com.
Then Rosa will pass as a tropical storm through Mexico to the north and on Tuesday morning in the morning will arrive at the border of Arizona. Then she will pass through Arizona and on Tuesday night she will enter southern Utah.
“It is expected that the main risk of Rosa or its remains will be a very strong rainfall in Baja California, Northwestern Sonora and the South West of the USA,” reports the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause mortally dangerous floods and streams of rubble in deserts and landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a stabbed 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As reported by the Avon and Somerset police, young men aged between 17 and 20 were arrested at night in the Radstock area.
Cops are looking for witnesses who might have a record of what happened on their mobile phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has "experienced wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection of the reckless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at the meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that during his nomination, Kavanaugh "taught on wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, where he definitely and emotionally refused Christine Blasey Ford's statement that she was sexually assaulted by teenagers a few decades ago.
She also testified to Ford at the hearing about her charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “there were American witnesses of Kavanaugh’s perfection and quality and courage. ”
His supporters from West Virginia said that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has excellent public service at the end of the day.”
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it is that the Republicans participate in the mid-term elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't run, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump stated that the Democrats decided to "resist" and "defence".
The management adviser to the Republican Party told the CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the Board is expected at the latest on Friday.
The earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people, and the number of victims is still growing.
The authorities announced on Saturday that, after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit a vast earthquake and tsunami, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of which broke the huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On a beach in Palu on Friday, hundreds of people met at the festival. At dusk, however, the coasts hit up to six-meter waves, which many people killed and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The tsunami waves preceded an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people continued on the beach activities and didn’t immediately flee, so they fell down the waves for the victim,” said the spokesperson of the Indonesian Agency for the relief of the BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugro’s disaster on the breakfast in Jakarta.
“The tsunami wave did not walk alone, took cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground,” said Negroho, adding that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami wave spread at an open sea rate of 800 km/h.
He said that some people fled into trees before the wave and survived.
Approximately 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pal.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster relief agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences trembled through the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by Friday's powerful quakes was approximately 200 times greater than the force of the atomic bomb dropped in the Second World War on Hiroshim.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have increased the tsunami wave.
Negro described the damage as “extensive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the destroyed buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the amount of victims and damage could be higher on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicentre of earthquakes.
According to him, the communication was "excessed without any information" from Donggala.
In his statement, the Red Cross stated that over 300,000 people live in the area, adding that their workers and volunteers are headed to the affected places.
“It’s tragic, but it could get a lot worse,” says the statement.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday because it did not inform that Pala was hit by a tsunami wave, although the authorities indicated that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
On the amateur footage shared on the social media, it is heard by a man on the upper floor of the building screaming with a desperate scream warning people on the street from an approaching tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the coast will hit the water wall, which carries away buildings and cars.
Agent Reuters was unable to verify the footage immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a large blackout in electricity, which interrupted communication in the vicinity of Pal, so that the authorities could only difficultly coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the military began to send cargo aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other essential needs.
Airport in the city has been re-opened only for the transport of assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo should have visited the evacuation center in Palu on Saturday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in Paula city, where employees hide in shelters from a cell built in a yard of office buildings, they saw the images of destruction on the way, says Mr. Doseb.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When the auxiliary groups began their sad work to assist in disasters, some complained that foreign workers with great experience could not come to Paul.
According to the Indonesian legislation, financing, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to flow to the site of the calamite if the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," says the spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross of Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says “OK, this is a national disaster”, we can start international aid, but it is not yet the case.”
When Paul was the second night after the earthquake and the tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that lighten the dark stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, paramedics set free a woman who was imprisoned under the ruins of her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidings on Asian games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Another of the people trapped in Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Mr. Gendon expressed how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages through whatsApp contestants from Pal, who attended the beach festival.
But instead of a pair of blue ticks, his messages ended with a gray mark.
"I believe that this means that the news has not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took 26,750 dollars while supplementing the ATM in Newport on the Left
According to the press release of the Newport Police Department, thieves stolen 26,750 USD from Brink's employee on the Levee on Friday morning in addition to the ATM in Newport.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the car driver was draining ATMs in the entertainment complex and he was preparing to put more money in it.
When he did that, another man "runs out of the behind the staff of Brink" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in an ATM.
According to the press release, several suspects have seen people fleeing from the scene, but the police have not clarified the number of people involved in the incidents.
Any information on the identity of suspected persons shall be provided to the police in Newport at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes his name - to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West. ”
For some time now, the 11-year-old West has a Ye nickname, and the pseudonym has used it as the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should introduce his new album Yandhi.
In the show, she will replace Arian Grande, who cancelled her participation for "sensitive reasons," as told the show's creator.
In addition to shortening his current professional name and his religious significance, West has said earlier.
“In my opinion,ye is the most used word in the Bible, which means “you,” when he spoke to Big Boy about his album at the beginning of this year.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It changed from Kanya, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are."
The name changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love (love) and Brother Love (Brother Love).
The former West associate, JAY-Z, also texted alternately with and without the liaison, and in large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the military against civilians
On the occasion of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the bloody intervention against students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador committed himself to never using military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatellco Plaza that “he would never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
By the time there was a left-wing student movement across Latin America, soldiers on October 2, 1968 began shooting people at peaceful demonstrations on the square and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those who study and by opening up other free public universities.
He declared that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education are leading young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
According to an investor and an artificial intelligence expert, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the US government have published notifications about AI, although the US as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China has introduced a plan that it wants to be the number one in innovation AI by 2030.
"The duplication of the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are much further away than the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
Lee said this week in an interview for CNBC that doubled funding could double the chance that the next major discovery in the area of AI will be made in the USA.
Lee, who published this month in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, published his book “Superpowers AI: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order”, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most significant AI companies in China, Face++.
He worked for AI at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s to overcome the best American player in Othello, and later he was head of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated the previous U.S. government technological competitions, such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge, and asked when it would be the next to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"Academic peaks are not taking China away, but corporations," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing the best university experts in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
To improve efforts in the field of AI, according to Lee the United States could also help change immigration policy.
“In my opinion, green cards should be offered to holders of a doctorate in the field of AI,” he says.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a plan for the development of the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides finance to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Council and other government organizations spend money on researchers in the USA, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
This year, the U.S. Defence Department established a Joint Centre for artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Selection Committee for artificial intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an AI Next initiative.
As far as NSF is concerned, it now invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
However, the US legislation that wanted to set up the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", which would solve a few decades old dispute with Greece blocking applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbor is entitled to its territory and therefore veto the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents object that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovenian population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether at least 50 percent of the voters needed would come forward in order to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you for NATO and the EU membership with the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name change, including the Prime Minister of Zoran Zaev, state that it is a price to pay for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the roof of the European Union, because this means safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, a number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The Electoral Commission stated that no problems had been reported within 13 hours.
However, the vote was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters finally passed their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and son of Dushko, give their votes in the Macedonian referendum to change the name that would open the country's journey to NATO and the European Union in Strumice, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and pulls chairs in front of tents built by people who boycott.
"We are NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not the door for the servants," says Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can address others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%, so much needed investment.
"I think that the large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
The "yes" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, a referendum could take part between 30 and 43 percent of the voters – less than the required participation.
In another survey organised by the Macedonian Telma TV station, 57 percent of respondents were found to vote on Sunday.
Of them 70 % said they would vote yes.
In order for a referendum to be successful, 50 percent plus one voter must take part.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first major blow to the policy of the Western government since its onset last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has gone for a goal through Brighton's entire defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling launched Brighton's defense on Saturday, ensuring Manchester City win of 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguera's administration, his goal looked ridiculously easy in 65 minutes.
It all started with a pass that an Argentine attacker got in the middle of the field.
He was pro-printing between three Brighton defenders, and he got into an open space.
And Aguera surrounded four green uniforms.
At the edge of the fine territory of Brighton, one defenseman went round and overrun several others.
He found Sterling with the next pass to the left.
The English attacker knocked the ball in the penalty area back to Aguer, who with his right hand beat Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalie with the right side of the net.
“Aguero has leg problems,” announced the manager of City Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We thought he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it was.
We were lucky to have a goal at that point."
The initial advantage for Sky Blues in this Premier League match was established by Sterling.
This goal fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's territory.
On the left hand side, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a remote stick.
Attacker Sky Blues cellar the ball into the net just before it slipped off the field.
The city will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the League of Champions at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the fun of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the fight for the playoffs, there were not many reasons to re-enter.
But eternally competitive Scherzer hopes to stand up for a pitcher in a fight against Colorado Rockies on Sunday – only if they have Rockies who run one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, hope for a playoff.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night by winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but they still want to get their first degree in the division.
“Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw it out, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with about the greatest effort I’ll ever experience.
Why wouldn't I play it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but reportedly resorting to pitching Scherzer under such a situation.
For Schererer, it would be the 34th start, training on Thursday and pitching on Sundays when he's usually off.
The right-wing pitcher of Washington has 18-7 statistics in this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump performed at meetings in West Virginia
The President has indirectly referred to the situation of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to take part in elections in the middle of the term of office.
“In November, everything we have done will be at stake.
One of the most important choices in our lives is five weeks.
It is one of the big, big ones – I do not run, but we are still on the move and everywhere I fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see that it is happening right now.
And they're determined to take power through whatever means they need, you see wickedness, abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to fight to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats decided to "resistance and obstruction".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, saying, "the Democrats are angry and mean and repulsive and lying."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Court, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud awakening of the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait – that was a really bad speech of the body – the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a variety of views.
He is intolerant to those who express their views
When activists from Moment voted in favour of my reminder on my local side, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to whom they said they were not welcome – because they sincerely said their views.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, a reminder criticized me that I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, regarding national security, about Europe, paradoxically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The announcement of a Friday meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East stated that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
Most of the eight years I've been a local member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meeting was exactly like that on Friday night.
Unfortunately, the majority of the meetings are not being held today, and the promise of a "lover, more kind" policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are intolerant in the Labour Party and each opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the Party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues I thought we had similar political views, suddenly expected me to turn 180° and to hold positions that I could not agree with – whether it is national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and no matter what I say – there is a tidbit of social media abuse, where they call for my appeal, condemn the politics of the center and tell me that I shouldn't be on the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the rush of sexual or racist insults every day, but will never retreat.
One aspect of this era of politics that I am most disappointed with is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the diverse picture stream and with every proposal to express distrust or change in selection rules, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, they have advised me to stay back, not so much of a call, and then "I'll be fine".
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, I have been provoked by the negligence of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who let my general school class literally fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them – whether as a local councilman or minister of government.
I've never concealed my policy, nor in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only say that when the country is moving towards the Brexit, which will harm the household, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
Of course, my main message is not addressed to Momenta in Nottingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of appeal or political pragmatism will dissuade me from acting according to what is best interest to all of you in my opinion.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two late fives had a little distorting the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully fun Tennent's Premiership game.
Now they're at the forefront of the table, like the only undefeated ones.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and a better use of chances, which helped households to win, and Coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been through big trials in our fights, and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All the honors of Ayra have taken chances better than we have. ”
Five Grant Anderson in 14 minutes, transformed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numbers and Jason Baggot to win the unaltered five.
Climo raised Ayru's lead with a penalty, and then he scored right in the middle of time and changed the solo attempt, so he adjusted it to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and the five of Patrick Anderson, turned by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer hold-up due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who left the field on the stretchers, and when he started playing again, Ayr jumped again thanks to the five Stafford McDowall, which he turned Climo.
Representing Captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then received the yellow card and Melrose again used the player extra thanks to the unaltered five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
The house came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking Clima without the ball, MacPherson of the penalty order put the ball behind the progressive maulem of Ayru.
Climo turned, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth home five.

"The Sea is Ours": Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are patrolling from the marine headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
There's a blue flag in the color of the ocean above public buildings.
The marine bases of Lake Titicaca for Amazon are described by password: “The sea is our right.
Getting it is our duty."
Throughout the Inland Bolivia, there is still a living memory of the coast that the country lost in favor of Chile in a bloody war for resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to relocate the Pacific Ocean.
These desires may be the greatest in a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for a decision by the International Court of Justice, which should fall on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has energy, spirit of unity and calmness and, of course, expects a positive result,” says Bolvian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow MSD's decision on large screens all over the country hoping that the Hague Tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after many decades of interrupted interviews, Chile is obliged to discuss the fact that Bolivia will provide sovereign access to the sea.
Charismatic native President Bolivia Evo Morales – who has a controversial battle for next year’s re-elect – is also very interested in Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court should decide in favour of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
This UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to anyone and stated that it would not determine the outcome of possible interviews.
The fact that the MSD’s decision comes only six months after the last arguments were made shows that the case “was not complicated”, as Paz Zárate says, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, not only have they not supported Bolivia's cause, but maybe she's been delayed.
"The issues of access to the sea have been tackled by the existing Bolvian government," says Zárate.
He adds that Morales' attacking rhetoric has weakened all the remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will once again act, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to hold a discussion.
Both countries haven't switched ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were unusually rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual advantages,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless the US can't believe it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never arm its nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to carry out the promises made at the summit of the leaders of the two rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after the US Minister of Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo is about to restart the nuclear diplomacy, which has been stuck at a dead point, for more than three months for Singapore meetings with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a “fleet of hope” that the ongoing sanctions and objections of the United States against a declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes be brought down by the North on its knees.
Washington is careful with the approval of the declaration, unless Pchjongyang makes significant disarmament steps first.
Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
However, there is a general scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to secure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pchjongjang next month to prepare for the second summit Kim-Trump.
Paris shows that your fashion stores will soon arrive at the latest trend of huge headgear
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a number of giant headgears for their spring/summer 2019 collection at the show which has engulfed everyone at the Paris fashion week.
The Instagram flooded very impractical hats this summer and these designers sent their exciting creation to the pier.
The exhibition piece from Valentin was an over-exposure beige hat with a wide margin resembling feathers, which flooded the heads of the models.
Other excessively large additions were decorated with melons, a witch hat and even pineapple – but they are not intended to warm their heads.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a tap with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with huge fashion – you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could come to fashion stores as well.
The oversized hats come for "La Bomba", a straw with half a meter wide cremation, which everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wore.
The cult mark behind this very impractical hat, which flooded the social media, sent another huge creation to the showroom – a straw beach bag, which is almost as big as the swimwear model that carries it.
A dark orange Rafi bag lined with raffia shakes and equipped with white leather handle was a fashionable piece of La Riviera spring/summer 2019 by Jacques at the Paris week.
The celebrityist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for the next summer – given that the designer has been so successful with them, it would be difficult to ignore demand for excessively large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
The Scottish independent schools have many academic successes, and it continues in 2018 with other excellent test results. Individual and group successes in sports, art, music and other community activities only underline it.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, representing them the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and trying to provide their pupils and parents with the best possible level of service.
Independent schools are preparing their pupils for the next and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement individually adapted school education plans, we observe that modern languages in schools are still popular and desirable.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes right into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes right into his heart."
It is a significant point that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year's tests show that the languages are at the top of the tables, with independent schools failing to succeed.
A total of 68 percent of pupils who learned a foreign language achieved the best sign of A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest mark A reached 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent French students and 63 percent Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subjects chosen by pupils are in independent and other schools as well as STEM (scientifics, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
The survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for reasons which employers report as problems in the establishment of job vacancies, 17 percent of the under-language skills are not sufficient.
That is why language skills become increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career you choose, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future that you have such a lifelong skill.
With the ability to communicate directly with people from other countries, a person who speaks more languages will automatically benefit from competition.
According to a survey organised by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, namely 15%, being French.
That is why it is important for today's children to invest in language education.
If children learn more languages, especially languages of emerging economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scott, every school is different from what language it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for Great Britain in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have a choice of several languages with teachers who are in the field of experts at independent schools.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to ensuring the educational environment that children prepare and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever they want in the future.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages are absolutely important in a global business environment for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as "national communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will be the first time in a Lakers uniform in San Diego on Sunday
The fans who are looking forward to LeBron James joining the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time will soon be there.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would be playing in a Sunday opening game in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes it takes.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell on Twitter wrote that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the premier season.
“At this stage of my career I do not need pre-seasonal matches,” he said.
Trump's performances in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump at Wheeling, West Virginia, will launch a wave of the campaign's performances tonight.
It's the first of the five diaries scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate for a vacant position in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to obtain support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in November elections.
What time does Trump's performance start tonight, and how can you follow him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 Eastern Time, today on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia you can follow online below via live transmission to YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about hearing a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who was this week and was very tense about the accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior, and it is expected that the Senate's confirmation vote will be postponed a week before the FBI is under investigation.
But the main goal of this estate wave is to help the Republicans get the pace before the November elections.
According to the Reuters Agency, campaign organizers President Trump say that the next week's five meetings are aimed at "adding energy to volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
“The control of the Senate is so important for its agenda that the President will go to as many countries as possible in this busy season,” said Reuters spokesperson, Trump, who did not wish to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, supporters from “Ohia and Pennsylvania, ” who could be followed by the Pittsburgh media at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, today.
On Saturday it will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is falling behind in the polls.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President must come to help him in his research,” says the Reuters Politologist at Simon Haeder University.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team has shown that it has the stomach to fight to keep its hopes from Sunday singles
After three one-sided games, the Saturday couple could be just what Ryder Cup needed.
The rocking pendulum is a totally resourceful sports concept, but players really believe it, and most of all in such competitions.
So where's the pendulum going now?
"They've had six points, and now it's four points, so we're taking it so that the pendulum's probably moving a little towards us," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, it leads by four points, and there are still twelve points left.
As Spieth says, Americans feel that they have a little wind in sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day, and everyone can boast three points of four.
Spieth was deadly when he moved from the blast to the green, and he goes as an example.
Celebratory screams were even strengthened in the continuation of his bike when he managed the key heel to win the whole game when he and Tomas were behind two holes.
His putt, who won their 15-hole game, met with a similar scream that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
“You really had to go deep and take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that each of these players left behind.
18 holes for leaving a foot.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder Cup.
Strange but adorable couples from Europe are four out of four, and they can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who missed the hole on Saturday afternoon, but also last Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again Friday morning."
The course and the way in which energy flows both towards a stormy audience and from it confirms that these players are destined for Sunday's victory, and that by sunset over Le Golf Naitional will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
At the same time, it's best for a different hole.
However, the speakers of European glory remain premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked briefly with Serge Garcia, the hero of the morning play with four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Jamka and two devils buried Spaniards on the front nine and Sweden in a abyss that they no longer climbed out of.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you anymore.
The games of two pairs on two balls are so fascinating when you closely follow the interactions of people in the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give themselves, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and by the last day it has had a significant lead, but this game of two pairs has also shown that the US team has a stomach for fighting, which some, especially from the countries, have doubted.
To the final day Ryder Cup leads Europe with a score of 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of Ryder Cup, then from Saturday's double games on two balls came out with a head start of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who almost twice won over the Tiger Woods, were determined to make four cuts at Le Golf National.
The European party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy that they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games two balls with the American side, which failed in the series 3-1.
The US showed more resistance in four, won two games, but they couldn't get into a deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who, after the sensational weekend, got the nickname "Molliwood", are only the second couple to win four points of their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After the defeat of Woods and Patrick Reed in the game on two balls and then smoothly defeated tired Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed the occasional brilliant flashes, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in a two-ball game and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after a two-ball game in the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in a 2&1 double game of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the number ones and threes in the world's ranking.
Europe, however, did not have it on this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris won on the line.
The three-time Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spaniard Jon Rahme and Ian Poulter in the game for two balls and returned later to defeat the pair of Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game of couples, although two first holes lost.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history the team returns from a four-point deficit to a two-point game, although as defending Fury's party needs only a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days it seems to be a Sunday counterattack behind them.
North Korea says that "no way" will be armed unilaterally and without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the continued sanctions of the UN have deepened their distrust of the United States, and in such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general meeting that North Korea has adopted "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, the disassembly of nuclear testing sites and the promise that they will not spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to unilaterally disarm itself."
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to the “progress” approach to denuclerisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every gradual step, his statement appeared to be significant in the fact that it did not reject unilateral denuclerisation only because Pyongjang had passed through it in the past.
Ri mentioned the joint declaration made by Kim Ching Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June when Kim committed himself to working on the "denuclarisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking formal termination of the 1950–53 war conflict, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the challenge of releasing severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“USA insists on “dneuclarisation first” and increases the pressure on sanctions to force its objectives, and even oppose “declaration of the end of war”, said Ri.
“I believe that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who do not know anything about us.
The problem is, however, that the continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed earlier in the United Nations last week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: “If deuclerisation were to be a party to this issue, South Korea and not the USA, the deuclerisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a stalemate."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from that last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles in the territory of the United States is inevitable after Mr.
This year, in the UN Trump, which threatened North Korea's "total destruction" last year, praised Kim for his courage to take action to disarm, but said that many work and sanctions must remain valid until North Korea has been completely de-declarized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not have a time frame, he said: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it does not matter. ”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, however, the US Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue in a firm and unstoppable way until we are aware of the complete, final, verified denuclarisation"
The Security Council unanimously supports sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to suppress the financing of the nuclear programmes and programmes of the Phjongyang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly and Pompeo said that he would visit Phjongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made only in order for North Korea to declare in a few hours that he had raised "gangster's demands".
North Korea has committed to meeting Moon this month to disassemble the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States adopts "corresponding measures".
He stated that Kim had announced to him that "correct measures" in which he hoped were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and was headed for normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course to teach them sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all its students sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of macho studies throughout the night, when students do not sleep and encourage themselves with caffeine.
The academics found that students at the world's most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of taking care of themselves.
Kurz proposed Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and the female hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he lectured on the impact of sleep depression on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, “Why do you say this to me only now, in my last year?”
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students the basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the University, said that the university decided to introduce a course after finding out that students were really unsanctioned during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part is the picture of student colleges where students click on cups with coffee, curtains, sneakers and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep shortages and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In other parts, participants are informed of how long-term sleep depression may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," says Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "study all night" still exists, added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep shortages is growing.
Enough sleep of good quality should be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, said - even in order not to get gained, because sleep depression turns the brain into hunger mode, so you are still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian chemical and physical biology student, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that he attended in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said he opened his eyes and inspired him to push the course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised the students to consider setting the alarm for the time when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can upset your circadian rhythm, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga sank Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered a further loss when Dolly Mengy's hits confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with the defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
On the Ibrox side, she tried to record her first victory from 4 to 1 February triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused only the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as a manager to leave his post eight points from the leading leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-life, and the Rangers lineup seemed without inspiration and determination to balance.
While Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston climbs third and right behind the Hibernian team as opposed to one goal.
And there might be more problems for Rangers after the Calum Spence bar referee had to be treated with head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side that went past Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who last week took the Point of Hearts and would be pleased to see his well-trained team choked their opponents at every step.
Rangers may have taken possession, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score only two minutes after the start when Menga first let Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the backup guy buried his big chance.
A long free copy of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only bite at the back post.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have a four-hour penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson broke the Colombian challenge off the table.
Rangers managed only two shots on target in the first half, but the former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by Lassany Coulibala's head and Ovie Ejaria's short shot.
While Livi's opener could have been against the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they've earned it for the hard work.
Rangers failed to deal with deep Jacobs' set again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and picked up Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and replaced Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost immediate effect when the wing collapsed into Morelos, but impressive Kelly fought from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into the game of exactly the kind that they like when Lithgow and Halkett metali one long ball after another.
Holt's party could have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor was well up to block Jacobs before Litgow ran off the corner.
Deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton was entitled to another late sentence when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger's counter
And now the website of our almanac "Nieday morning": 30 September 1882, today it is 136 years old, and it is still growing... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's computer.
At that time, Geiger Counter became a permanent pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in the main role of those seemingly improbable scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in God’s name is that?
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of atoms that are elicited by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: "Oh, yeah, now he's really into it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify dangerous cells as part of treatment
Method includes the extraction and conversion of immune cells from the patient in the laboratory
Then they can see a protein that is common to many cancers and then the rivet is injected again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
A woman who has been treated with a vaccine who has taught the immune system to recognise dangerous cells has disappeared ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation into a laboratory, so that they can "see" proteins common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-applied to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “ directs the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and taught them to focus on cancerous cells, was already promoted in the treatment of the type of leukaemia.
Kanye West attended the pro-trump sermon, in his maga cap, after his performance at SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was quenched in the Saturday Night Live studio after a confused performance, during which he praised the president of the United States of America, Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing the Make America Great Again, he began spitting on the Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“ I often talk to white people, and they say, “How can you like Trump? Is he racist?”
If I'd mind racism, I wouldn't have been in America for a long time," he said.
SNL launched a parody show with Matt Damon in the main role in which Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Court Committee on the rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the pictures of West's theater talk were recorded on the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock tried to mock West.
West also complained to the audience that his head decoration had been eaten in the back of the scenes.
“In the scenes, I was bullyed.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
It's a bully!
They also said I was in the wrong place," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the wrong place?” and added that “you would like to put your superman suit on, because that means you can’t say what to do.” Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments were earned only twice, and members of the SNL looked upset, embarrassed, said Variety, and one person even said, "The entire studio was completely silent."
West was invited as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing the song I Love dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the TPU Conservative Group, Candace Turner, tweeted: “To one of the most courageous characters: Thank you for having a davu."
But the guest talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West “was just who he was, and that is absolutely amazing.”
“But I NECHCI reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “art”) I believe to represent and send to the world of ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
As did we," she added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and walk in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
A colleague of rapper, Snoop Dogg, earlier named Snoop Lion and of course the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.

Game Thrones star Kit Harington has launched into toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy of the HBO series.
An actor, 31 years old, however, stepped out of the macho's stereotype and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be claimed to earn respect.
News The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he believed that "something was wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the era #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his star of the Rose Leslie throne, also 31, admitted to expressing himself strongly to this problem.
"At this point I personally feel, quite strongly - what happened so bad with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach a teenager about the problem we see here?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for rising toxic manhood due to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What do boys learn on TV, on the streets, from them grow the feeling that each man needs to have such a side of himself?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?
Because I'm sure something's changed to worse for a young man.
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequal Games about thrones after the series was completed because he already has enough "fights and horses".
From November, Kit will be playing in the restored Right West of Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting with his current wife Rose for what was best of the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so he gave me my future family and my whole life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this fantasy show awarded with the Emmy Award.
A couple got married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family house in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China shows a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official numbers, more than 820 000 people are affected by this virus.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who infected HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, reported Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 year-on-year.
Transferring HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is allegedly still widespread.
In view of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff would let GOP's data escape, the term "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories" go away.
On Saturday, American MP Maxine Waters condemned the claim that a member of her staff had sent personal data to three Republican senators on the wiki sites of the legislators.
Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the charges were supported by "ultrapravic" scientists and websites.
"The lies, lies, and other detestable lies," Waters said in her Twitter statement.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for American senators, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and published it by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing of sexual abuse charges by a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
Sometime after three senators questioned Kavanaugh, a leak of information.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which sources of contributions, is linked to Waters' office and published information on members of Waters' staff, says Hill.
"This unfounded claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The members of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were at risk as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations - were in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is an untruthful and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly earned an online criticism, including the former press secretary of Ari Fleischer's White House.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests he has no temperament to be a member of Congress."
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't be rude.
He must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
He must be calm and do not get excited."
It seemed that Fleischer compared Waters's response to the democratic criticism towards Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticised because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters stated that her office had alerted ‘the competent authorities and the authorities involved in the criminal proceedings on these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts that are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English again intervenes reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Rexit in every new film with the British tendency, which seems to be the case of this resurrection of Johnny English in a series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this brazen satire on the subject, how obviously bad the nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this culled, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to re-pack this thing in a completely new way - that name more than any other signal that is a wide comic creation designed for non-English speaking cinematographic audience.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims for smoothie glamour, has a little of Inspector Clouseau, the tip of Mr. Bean and the big coach of the guy who has hit the single tone in Chariots of Fire at the celebration of the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The character is also originally based on a traveler and an international mystery man, whom Atkinson once played in the forgotten TV commercials Barclaycard, leaving behind chaos.
In this last edition of JE will find one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in the medieval armor and the rotora blades had a short clink about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite subdued and strangely excessive, especially when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Imposible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like it's meant for children than adults, and for me, the crazy tramps of Johnny English are as resourceful and focused as Atkinson's silent film gagas in the person of Mr. Bean.
The ongoing assumption is that Britain has serious problems.
Cyber hacker infiltrated the British super-secret spy web network and revealed the identity of all British field operatives to the horror of an agent in the service - too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and presumptuous figure who already suffers under a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays the best possible role of Theresa May, but there is nothing in the script.
Her intelligence advisors will inform her that once every active spy is in danger, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English itself, who is now employed as a director in some luxurious facility, but also gives record lessons about how to be a secret agent: there are a few nice gags, because English offers an espionage academy similar to Rock School.
English came back to Whitehall for an emergency breakfast and met with its long - suffering partner Bough, who was played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an effective character who may be wasting some time with Vicki Pepperdine's talent.
So Batman and Robin are back in action for Her Majesty's secret service, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously subject to the charm of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be capable of solving British computer crimes: the evil Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyseu full of frackable patals: masked as waiters will light a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak onto Volt's luxury yachts; and English will start pure anarchy when they try to get to know Volt's interior using virtual reality.
All the aces are definitely ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and turbulent it is, it has something from the children's TV.
Quite a moderate matter.
And just like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't think of: can't the British film industry give Rowon Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labourists deny that they would develop a plan for the English to work four days a week to get paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and they will get paid in five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to hand over savings to the workers, which will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would have a three-day weekend - but they would still take the same reward.
Sources argue that this idea "fits" into the economic agenda of the Party and plans to clone the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of changing economies.
A long-term member of the Labour Times said for Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits the party's position to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not the policy of our party and the party does not take it into account".
The shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a work conference last week to fill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from "anonymous directors" and "scientists" in utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water companies do not have to return to their overall share, as the Labour government could make "losses" on the basis of perceived guilt.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees in the management board of companies and to create equity funds that will transfer 10% of private equity to employees who are entitled to the payment of annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, said on "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh might have changed their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the finding of the Office might be impelled by some Republican senators to pull their support.
In an interview from Sunday "60 minutes" the correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I want to say, of course," said Kennedy.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened when the charges came out, and he said, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
Graham , however , is unshockable .
“I’ve already made my decision on the Nad Brett Kavanaugh, and it would mean a truly explosive charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it hard," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom she appointed could check it out.
It's been 36 years.
I can't see anything's changed."
What is Global Citizen Festival and what did he do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York every year, offering a very impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission for the end of world poverty.
Global Citizen Festival in the seventh year will welcome tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was introduced in 2012, is the expansion of the Global Powers project, an international group to support poverty termination by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, e-mail to the world leader, phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before reaching his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really the way to convince them to demand an event, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people who feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet makes a difference?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has seen more than 19 million "actions" by his supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
He says that these actions have contributed to the world leaders’ notification of commitments and measures worth more than 37 billion dollars to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that provided funds still have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, the British Partnership of Investors and Realtors, who have committed themselves “to helping children grow into their full potential,” which promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4 700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, like you, we can make a point in history of social injustice," Ambassador to the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ulman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 events that called for the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which would address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just like the great civil rights and the movement against apartheid, we will succeed before us because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is one of those who will be performing this year in New York, who will host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. Navy could use a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington can "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from falling into the markets, including the Middle East, reveal the U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's engagement in Syria - especially where it operates on the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to convey energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“United States have the opportunity to assist our Navy to make sure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market,” he said.
Zinke called on participants in an event organised by the consumer energy alliance, a non-profit group that is adopted as a “consumer’s energy” voice in the US.
He compared Washington's approach and dealings with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were virtually the same.
“Economic options for Iran and Russia are more or less investments in or replacement of fuel,” he said while referring to Russia as a “one-purpose” player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declaration comes because Trump's administration is on a mission to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replaced the Russian one, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, officials of Trump’s administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project of Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin “the hands” of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $111 billion, which is supposed to double the existing pipe capacity to 110 billion sqm, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington’s zeal for the project is simply driven by economic reasons and an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting the US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US took a stand from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organization, the German Federation (BDI), has called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to look closely at the 2020 presidential candidate, says the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that, on Saturday, after the elections in the middle of the parliamentary period, she would "look closely" at the President's candidacy.
During the Holyoke City Hall meeting, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering candidacy.
"It is time for women to come to Washington and repair our broken government, including the top female position," she said according to The Hill.
"I'll be looking closely at the presidential candidate after 6 November."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that "he is leading this country in a bad direction".
"I am afraid until the bones of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the report published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters from Massachusetts reported that the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent would support the running.
The survey has shown greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-ranking democratic names spoken of in connection with potential candidacy until 2020 include former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially decide in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin to meet Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being listed in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, may concern other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience for a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the sun in the room" and said about her son and other war veterans that "there are some others returning, returning, returning, asking if there is any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the army, gives their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, interference in the report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon in drunkenness, said Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal call for new measures by the U.S. government, which deny asylum to victims fleeing the gang or domestic violence.
On Friday, 18 states and the Washington district issued a short report to support asylum seekers and question this measure, the NBC stated.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions case, who in August handed down the American Civil Liberties Organisation against federal politics was not revealed.
She said that her partner "and his sons and members of the violent gang" abused her, but American officials refused to apply for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The attorneys of the States supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations that face all sorts of problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the US has reversed the decision of the 2014 Appeal Chamber of Migrants, which allowed illegal immigrants who flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. in Friday's statement stated that the new measure "is ignoring the decades of state, federal and international law".
“The Federal Law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” said a short friend.
The lawyers further argued that a policy that denies the entry of immigrants is damaging the US economy and says that it is more likely that entrepreneurs will become and "will add the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the judges in the area of immigration not to offer asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion,” said the Sessions in his statement of 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to mitigate all problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, where the number of victims has already doubled, races when searching for survivors with time
For survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
“It’s very tense,” said Risa Kusum’s 35 - year - old mother, who comforted her hot little boy in an evacuation center in the drenched town of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance will bring more bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, choosing through wet things and trying to save anything they find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that were destroyed by an 7.5 earthquake were crippled.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture in the spine and shoulder, rested at Palu's army hospital, where patients were treated outside for continued severe aftershocks.
His tears filled his eyes when he pictured the feeling that violent earthquakes trembled the hotel's room on the fifth floor, sharing peace with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall," said Haris for the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay."
Ambassador of the United States accuses China of "scanting" propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page commercial in the U.S. daily, which focused on the mutual advantages of trade between the USA and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump mentioned the payment of China Daily's extra charge in Des Moines - the state of the largest sales newspaper in Iowa - after he accused China of trying to get involved in US congress elections on November 6.
Trump's accusations of Beijing trying to interfere in the American elections indicated what the American leaders said that Reuters was a new phase escalating campaigns by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to mention commercial promotion advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war which is manifested at the level of mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa, which supported Trump’s republican side, were said by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his opinion on Sunday on the Des Moines Register that China is now doubled by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“When spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the valuable tradition of free expression and free press by placing paid advertising in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“In contrast, in a newspaper stand on Beijing Street, you will find limited dissenting votes and you will not see any real reflection of the incoherent views that the Chinese might have on the alarming economic track of China, given that the media belong to the company “China Communist Party”.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish the offer” his article, although it did not say which newspapers.
The Republicans are leaving their electorate before the election for a kavanaugh debacle, warning analysts
As many top Republicans defend a candidate for Chief Judge Brett Kavanaug, who is facing several sexual assault charges, the analyst warned that during the upcoming mid-term elections they would recognize a response, especially from women.
The emotions around this case were extremely high, and most Republicans on the record already say they want to continue the vote.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell University in Syracuse.
Reeher said that he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon) at the last minute to pursue an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget about it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, Chief Advisor and spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “The November is coming!” at a demonstration in the hall of the Senate, where Republicans, who are in charge of the Justice Commission, decided to name Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it was already high, that's right."
However, this could be higher, especially between the weighting female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29, who do not like the president, but often do not go to elections."
Even before Ford's public testimony in detail concerning her sexual assault charges, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, the opposition might follow.
"The confused mess for the GOP is being played," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“This is not just about the vote in committee or about the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh will sit on the table, it is also about how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it,” said Guy Cecil, head of the US priorities, a group that helps vote for the Democrats, pointed out the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in the opinion that they believe in the light of the Fords and the Kavanaughs' testimony, with a little more sympathy for the other named.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent reported that they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After pressure from Flake the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh was drunk attacking her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitalia at the party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new Internet and get ahead of Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Open Source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that Inrupt's goal was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that enables people to create their own "personal online data storage" or "pod".
It may include contact lists, job lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like a Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is special about personal online data storage is that it is entirely on the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authorisation through data."
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to John Bruce's CEO, to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the employees working on the project cooperated on the project and a community of voluntary programmers.
Since this week, technological developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google aren’t talking about making a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in his contribution to the media published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the discussion about the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the site,” said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the clergy, which during World War I received Victoria's Cross
The celebrations have been held for hundreds of years since the only spiritual Church of England acquired Victoria's cross as a warrior during World War I.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the 29th of September 1918 during the attack on Bellenglys and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, the sniper killed him, and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandkids discovered a memorial stone on Saturday at the Rushden ceremony.
One of his great-grandfathers, Michael Vann, said that it was “genius symbolic” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s winning work.
According to London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Lt Col Vann led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quetin's very dense fog and a strong shooting of field guns and machine guns."
Later, he entered the first line, and with “most courage” he led the line forward before he himself threw himself into the firefield and knocked out three separate units.
Colonel Vanna killed the German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72 - year - old Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, but at the same time something that is humiliating. ”
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, led by the youth group, put the wreath.
Michael Vann said that “he felt great honor that he could participate in the show” and added that“ the fury of a true hero is shown by the support that many people will provide. ”
MMA fans stayed up all night to track Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the bloated Bellator 206, just to be denied you the main event.
The San José bill contained 13 points, including six on the main card, and live broadcasts took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's fight, the viewers in the UK were in awe when the newsroom changed to the Peppa Pig Show.
Some remained unnerving after they were awake for the fight until the early morning hours.
One of the fans on Twitter described a change to the children's show as "a sure form of a bad joke."
“It is not appropriate to send children’s shows at 6 a.m. under the government regulation, and it is therefore necessary to send such content,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication to Bellator after being asked about this transfer.
"Peppa sparrow," yes.
Bellator President Scott Coker said they would work on the program so that the audience in the UK will be involved in the future.
“I think that when I think about broadcasting, we can probably make it,” Cooker said.
“But it’s six o’clock a.m. Sunday, and we can’t make it by Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth and not all of them were just friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We will reduce it to five games instead of six – as we normally do – and we have tried to keep our promise to the fans and we have failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less priced" for sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up with a feeling of minority for all because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to go for success.
A 24 - year - old athlete said he didn’t realize that “not all of them are like him. ”
On the first discussion, Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, introduced by Lauren Laverne, said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that, thanks to the possibility of becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-term Kirsty Young series was free for several months due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a suspect in Lavern's first program, said that he felt "less" than anyone who grew up with him at the same time because "it was not socially unacceptable for you boys and girls to like."
He said: “Until now these feelings have been less valuable and different, the real things that gave me strength and power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone", said not to disappoint anyone who might have found out what it's like with his sexuality.
The double holder of the bronze Olympic Medal has become a right fighter for the LGBT movement with a high profile and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he heard from him because he felt lucky that he could openly live without consequences and would add “hope to others. ”
This three-time world champion stated that he was in love with a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – “has caught up with the unprepared.”
Daley married the Oscar holder, who is 20 years older, took last year, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age – he was 14 years old when he died of cancer three years later – he said it was not easy to find someone of the same age who experienced similar increases and falls.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Dámy's son in June and Daley said that "the whole point of view changed."
"If you asked me last year, it would all be like, "I want to win a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said that his father wasn't allowed to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him – you won’t be in the first place, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
A year later, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I knew that I had dreamed of it my whole life – jumping in front of our domestics in Olympics,” he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first composition – Proud by Heather Small – which resonated with him at the start of the Olympics and kept causing goose bumps in it.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on a bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson would record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup game, but he would have had to tune out the form to prevent it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played the event every two years on the double-to-be record, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's Fourballs and Foursomes on the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as has often been in the United States, he spent five times his day alternately between cheerleaders and working on a game in a row, which he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, even at the top of his career, so it is not an ideal choice for a narrow playground Le Golf National, where long divided terrain is routinely punishing stray missiles.
And if the golf course itself is not quite disturbing, Mickelson is facing the exact British Open Francesco Molinari champion who won all four of his matches on the team with Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If the Americans who had four points less, had launched 12 separate swords, they would have avoided the quick onset, the Mickelson machete could have proved to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed his trust in his man and gave nothing else.
"He totally understood the role he had played today, patted me on his back, gave me a hand around my shoulders and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He believes so much.
He is a member of the Hall of Lama, and in the past and this week he has been so beneficial for these teams.
I guess I just couldn't imagine him playing two machetes.
I imagined more, but that's how it developed, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson beats Nick Fald's record in most of the West Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a career at Ryder Cup, which never reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has reached 18 victories, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says that his presence of the team has produced certain intangible results.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great partner in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also had fun going to him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the great leadership in the singles of the last days at Ryder Cup can easily change to an uncomfortable ride.
The data debuted at the 1997 Valderram game, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they reached the finish line with a total of 141/2-131/2.
“You have to keep remind yourself that we had a big lead in Valderram, as well as in Brooklin where we lost, and in Valderram where we won but only close,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching when they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday in 2018 to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So, history and every member of this team have shown me that it's not over.
You're going to be bored tomorrow.
Go in there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all the points are on the board.
We've got a target, and that's why we're trying to get the trophy and we're focusing on it.
I said I'd focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other hand – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, pleased by the way his players did on a complicated golf course, added: “I would never do it myself.
We have another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out with your partner when it goes well, but when you're there to be alone, your golfer's capacity is fully checked.
That's the message you have to give to players to get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players play better as individuals than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great twists when he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn to end up like a loser when Europe reached "The Miracle in Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players to head for the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start as fast as Brooklyn, like Medinah.
When this pace goes one way, it puts considerable pressure on the middle matches.
That's what we set up, and we made sure the boys felt like they were gonna feel like we were supposed to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to attack and confront Rory McIlroy in the top game: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“I went with this group of boys in that order, because I think it covers the whole trip, Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
The German new warship has been rescheduled
The latest German marine frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be available for at least one more year due to incorrect systems and snowy coastline, reports local media.
The operation of the boat leader "Rheinland-Pfalz", a completely new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the Die Zeit of the quoting spokesperson.
The vessel was to become part of the Navy in 2014, but difficult after delivery problems made the fate of this ambitious project uncomfortable.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which have been ordered by the Navy in 2007, will serve as a replacement for the ageing frigate of the Bremen class.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to apply the latest frigates for up to two years outside of home port.
However, continuous delays mean that top seaships – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas – will be obsolete by the time they put into operation, notes the Die Zeit daily.
The infamous F125 frigate arrived in the newspaper last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship manufacturers after the transfer.
Few were known about the reasons for returning, but the German media quoted a number of fundamental "software errors and faults on metal elements" defects that would make the warship useless when deployed into combat.
The faults of the software were particularly significant because the ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will operate a crew of 120 sailors – half of the workers needed on the Bremen class frigates.
It also showed that the ship has a considerable overweight, reducing its performance and reducing the ability of the Navy to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton ship Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faults on metal elements, the cost of the whole project – including crew training – is also the problem.
It is said that out of the original €2.2 billion, the price has risen to €3.1 billion.
The latest fregat problems have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, confirmed that the Navy really "committed ships are running out."
This representative stated that the problems had been continuously packed because the old ships had been removed from service but no replacements had been provided.
He claimed that none of the frigate class Baden-Wuerttemberg was able to become part of the Navy equipment.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
At the settlement of bats in the Highland of Scotland, there is a new research aimed at revealing how bats use the landscape in hunting food.
There is hope that research findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help manage future activities to preserve this species.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by bats whistling and the smallest and brown long and watery in the Inverewe Gardens botanical garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the key areas in this bat settlement, which will monitor the activities of bats throughout the whole season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using manual detectors.
A professional sound analysis of all recordings detects the frequency of bat calls and what individual species do.
A map of the habitat and the report will then be issued, which will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural resources adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important for bats and how individual species use them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of working on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and the best procedure for maintaining wooded areas for bats and other associated species.
Bats of the population in Scotland and the entire UK in the last century have lost great weight.
They are at risk as a result of construction and territorial development, which affects colonies and natural environments.
The risks can also include wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of construction materials as well as cat attacks.
Bats aren't actually blind.
But their ears are more useful when hunting at night than their eyes.
They use the sophisticated echo-location technique to track the bugs and obstacles in flight.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, colony checks, and sometimes rescue work.
This organization even established the first and only reserved bat reservation at the Threave residence in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of ten bats in Scotland.
David Thompson's seat manager states that this is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees, and the best habitat.
But there's too much that we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand what they need to survive."
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance work in real estate, because it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and youngsters, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of the Bat Maintenance Trust, encourages the public to put her hand to work and help.
She said: “We have a lot to know about our bats and many species that we do not know how their populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo refuses rape charges and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape "false reports" and stated that people "want to see" using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, who reported these charges.
This Portuguese and assailant for Juventus was charged with rape by American Kathryn Mayorgy in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the case, to inform Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the publication of the charges, Ronaldo spoke in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers and referred to the information as "false messages".
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are false messages," said the five-time holder of the Gold Ball Award to the camera.
"They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to the Reuters Agency, Ronald's lawyers are about to accuse Der Spiegel of unfounded charges that they called "unauthorized announcements of suspicion in the private area".
A lawyer named Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for "moral damage of the equivalent severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights lately."
The alleged incident was due in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Las Vegas Casino.
After getting acquainted at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the playroom, where they reportedly raped her according to the documentation filed in the Clark County District Court district in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after an alleged incident, kneeled and told her that he was "99 percent" of "cladas" and "one percent" disappointed.
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for the sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "feared of revenge" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims she is now seeking a retrial because she is still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronalda bought it for EUR 100 million this summer by the famous Italian club Juve.
Rexit: United Kingdom will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its world leader status in car production after Brexit, said secretary for Greg Clark.
He added that it was "unsettling" that the Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without agreement, it would have temporarily stopped production in the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of the delays at the border if a Brexit agreement is not concluded, can be made by the State of employment.
In the Burnaston plant, where Auris and Avensis cars were manufactured by Toyota, almost 150,000 cars were produced last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would record a stop of production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other automobiles, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, in the UK, spread fear of leaving the EU without agreement as regards the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, reports that it will close its mini-car manufacturing plant in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are what manufacturers call the risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is in operation on the basis of supplies of "just in time", with parts delivered from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars manufactured on order within 37 minutes.
If the UK left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a border break, which, according to the industry, could lead to a delay and a lack of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in the Derbyshire plant at the warehouse, the company said, and so there would be a stop of production.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plans to revive future relations with the EU are "precisely calibrated so that these border controls do not occur."
“We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the grip of this opportunity,” said Radio 4’s Today.
"The proof not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long run it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has been working for Burnaston for 24 years and is the chairman of the trade union, said that members of the trade union are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places are lost, he will never return.
The spokesperson said: "We have established a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, states the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" because he continued to fight for the post of Supreme Judge with Brett Kavanaugh, told the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein sees Robert Mueller's special council working on the Russian elections, the ties between Trump's aide and Russia, and the president's possible legal obstruction.
Whether Trump release the acting attorney-general and thereby threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's knocks have been on the line for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of putting the president down through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the message.
Last Monday, however, he arrived in the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he wouldn't let Rosenstein go, but then the meeting was delayed, so that she wouldn't interfere with the hearing at the Senate Court Committee where they gave Kavanaugh's witness statements and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's weekly investigation into Kavanaugh's charges, which delayed the full vote of the Senate again.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on the Fox channel on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “There has not yet been a date, it may be this week, it may be necessary to move another week to take account of everything else that is taking place in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and always communicate current information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not arranged a press conference with the White House since September 10.
The host of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not caused by an aversion to the "dive length" of television reporters, even though she said: "I do not agree with the fact that she will perform."
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she added without giving evidence. "We were looking at the numbers."
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press representatives had the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying and you've seen that we've been doing this over the last few weeks and there's a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visitors to the High Representative.
The press conferences themselves are rare.
This week, in New York City, the president probably showed why he and his loose and sometimes bizarre view of the reporters gathered.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland not to fear Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers who work in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish for them to stay after Brexit as well.
Jeane Freeman’s SMEs sent a letter not more than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to settle the costs of requests for settlement of EU citizens working in the public services transferred.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “For the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU are on the move, and they are heading towards the expected decision this autumn.
However, the British Government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible withdrawal scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to assure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial for patients and communities to whom we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and our warm wish is for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie proceeds from an emergency surgery following a head injury
The removed defenseman Tigers of Tennessee Christion Abercrombie proceeded to emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in Saturday's defeat 31-27 from the opponent Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The head coach of the state of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-life.
"He came to the side line and simply collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics put Abercrombie on the side line of oxygen and then put him on a stretcher and prepared for further assessment.
A government shareholder in Tennessee told Chrisz Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had carried out surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no "no details of the type/range of injury" and that the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second in a red shirt, graduated from the first season for the State of Tennessee after the transfer from Illinois.
Before the game was completed on Saturday, he had five total interventions, which means a total of 18 interventions in the season.
Foreign merchants will be charged a higher real estate tax when purchasing real estate in the UK
A foreign buyer will be charged a higher real estate tax when he buys real estate in the UK, with extra money being used to help homeless people under the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
An increase in the duty of higher real estate tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
An increase of 120 million US dollars per year is expected to help homeless people.
The buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they purchase real estate in the UK, while the money will be used to help people without a home, will announce Theresa May today.
This action will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with a promise to provide affordable accommodation and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in real estate tax will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, while money will further strengthen government efforts to fight sleep without a roof.
The additional charge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay real estate tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in the case of second homes and purchases for rental purposes, can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury is expected to raise its funds by up to £ 120 million per year.
The estimates say that the newly built properties in London buy 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of Great Britain, which drive away prices and makes it difficult for those who buy first time to get to home rankings.
A lot of rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "men of spirits" precisely because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new principles appeared just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in property tax to help more young people to own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding property prices high by taking up land but not using it, and insisted on Mrs. May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to repair the "income home" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive number of proposed housing reforms, including rental management and termination of "no faulty" evictions.
He also wants to strengthen the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “I said last year that I wanted to devote my efforts as prime minister for the restoration of the British dream – so that every new generation would have a better life.
And that means correcting our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and shape life.
However, it cannot be right that it is easy for entities that do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to be able to buy homes as well as hard-working residents of Great Britain.
For a lot of people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the shame of sleeping without a roof over their head is too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross states that it is his "most ambition" to become the manager of Scotland at some stage.
42-year-old Scot enjoys the resumption challenge of the North-East Club, which currently holds third position in the First League, just three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after he led the St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play like a player for my country.
I got rank B, and it was that," said Ross on the BBC Scotland's Sportsound channel.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that pulls me back.
Such an opportunity would come only if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as managers were Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety over the continuation of such established names in such a big club when he rejected the foreplays from Barnsley and Ipswich Town earlier.
“The success would have measured for me at that time whether I could return this club to the Premier League.
He undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League because of the structure and equipment at this club," he said.
"It's not an easy task to put him back there, but I guess I'd only feel successful if I could get the club back."
Ross has been doing his career in charge for only three years, before he worked as an auxiliary boss in Dumarton, and spent 15 months as one of the trainers of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to recover from the retreat to the third group and transformed St Mirren from the beginning of the decline to the winner of the championship title in the following season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he ever had in his career a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“These were probably actual intersections,” remembers the time when Alloa took over.
“I really believed that leadership was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, earning good money and enjoying reasonable heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you need to go through a week.
I keep going through them in terms of stress and pressure on the job, but I just feel good in the lead.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, I feel like I feel the most in my entire adult life."

Research found out that the perfect time for the pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased the income of British pubs facing difficulties, but has increased pressure on the restaurant chain.
The numbers show that pubs and bars have increased sales by 2.7 percent in July – but the restaurant income has decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, who produced the final report, said: “The stable sunlight and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June when pubs increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The restaurant sales decreased by 1.8 percent in June and worsened in July.
The pubs and drinks-tasting bars have been as powerful as the restaurants have made them worse.
The pubs, whose main sales are from food, also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent per month, while the sale of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analytical company for leisure activities and hospitality, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to selling outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chains continue to fight, although the annual decrease in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of the ongoing pressures on costs.
The long, hot summer cannot be worse for food and food-attractive operators to say whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring so much relief."
The overall growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Monitor for the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which is an established industrial scale in the sector.
Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks that they keep from their parents
Every fifth child – only 11 years old – has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and educators, shows research
Research among 20,000 secondary school students has shown the rise of "false Instagrams"
Reports have increased the concern that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of pupils reported that they had a “principal” account that parents knew about
Every fifth child – only 11 years old – creates accounts in social networks that hide from their parents.
A survey among 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in “false Instagram accounts” in which they share photographs.
Reports show that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students reported that they had a embellished “main” account, known of their parents, and at the same time had a private account.
A mother who encountered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found out that her teenage girl urged others to "be raped."
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, half accepting that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an inefficient director at the annual General Meeting of the Management Committee.
Doyle is the most valued light athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the transfer as a great opportunity for those who are in charge of sports such as those who will benefit her far-reaching experience at international level over the past decade.
“Eilidh has extensive respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that he will be very beneficial for the athletes in Scotland when he is a member of the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope to be really beneficial and to help lead the sport in Scotland.”
An American who won a total of four gold medals at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, won at 200 and 400 metres, and is now a BBC regular expert, could not walk after a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was time to see if I could get better or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've managed to get full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and I'm handling the exercise today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
Milk suction that causes mothers to compare to cows divides views online
The vacuum cleaner company divided the online opinion by advertising, which compares the nursing mothers to the milking cows.
As part of the placing on the market of the “first silent wearable vacuum cleaners in the world” Envi released music video with an exaggeration showing the freedom that the new vacuum cleaner gives to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows for a song saying, "Yes, I do, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you haven't noticed that I don't have vesicles, my breasts are here."
The congregation continues: “Pull, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, I drink with my sweet milk.”
However, advertising published on the company’s Facebook page caused an online controversial reaction.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and got mixed reactions from those who saw him, many of whom reported that it sheds light on the "horries" of the dairy industry.
‘A very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising on this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and give birth to give milk, but they have children taken away a few days after birth," says one of the comments.
Elvie is discretely put on breast-feeding (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “It is clearly traumatic for both mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise on the mother's breast pump that they keep their children?"
Someone else added, "The ad is completely out."
One woman admitted that the song was “infective”.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I was still breast-feeding.
Suction makes me feel like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's a big deal.
It's a genius product," one user wrote.
Another added: “It’s a fun commercial focused on mothers who suck their milk (often at work or at the toilet) and feel like cows.
It is not an advertisement to praise or destroy the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all dance with discreet vacuum cleaners hidden under the bra.
The concept of campaigning is based on the observation that a lot of women who suck their milk feel like cows.
But the Elvie vacuum cleaner is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses, and is beautifully hiding in a breast-feding bra, so that women are given freedom of movement, the possibility to hold a child and even when sucking off to walk.
Ana Balarin, a mother’s partner and ECD, added: “Elvie vacuum cleaner is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a strong and provocative marketing.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and milking cows, we wanted to point out the suction of milk and all the challenges associated with it while showing a fun and reliable sense of freedom that the new vacuum cleaner will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie was vacuumed in the sun.
During the London fashion week one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski appeared on the pier, which the product just used.
Hundreds of migrants moved quietly to their established camp at the border of Texas
In spite of the fact that the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in particular because the hard rhetoric and principles established by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children accompanied.
Most of the accompanying were traditionally made up of immigrants without documents, who were afraid of threatening the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed they belonged to the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at the immigration and customs department, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who requested the status of escorts of single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the people arrested did not have prior criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of the sponsors or sponsors' household members are illegally in our country, and many of them are criminals.
So we continue to prosecute them," said Albence.
According to asylum workers, representatives in an effort to improve the processing of child matters have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within one month of detention instead of the previous standard 60 days.
A lot of them appear through a videoconferencing call instead of personally declaring their case legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who, according to the report, are not entitled to help will be deported quickly.
The longer a child is in custody, the more likely it appears to be anxiety or depression, which may lead to rage or escape attempts, says asylum workers and reports from the system over the last few months.
The lawyers state that these fears are raised in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is suffering are most likely not noticed due to the size of the device.
They added that moving children to a state camp without enough time spent on emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends could cause trauma that a lot of children are already fighting.
Syria has announced that they have American, French and Turkish "occupational components" to download immediately.
During his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also called the Syrian refugees home after the return of the Syrian refugees, even though there is already an eighth year of war in the country.
Moual, who is also the prime minister, said that the foreign forces in the Syrian territory are illegally under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "this will be treated accordingly."
"He must give up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moually, “the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over,” with more than 360 000 people killed and millions lost their homes since 2011.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegally present aliens."
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria that mainly train Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and counseling them.
France has over 1,000 units of war on its territory.
In the release of Moual refugees, he said that the conditions for them to return were good and he accused “some western countries” of the “expansion of unrational fears” that caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We have called for international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"Politics on what should be purely a humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery assistance will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between the Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protection zone in the last refuge of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented the great attack of Syrian forces engulfed by Russia in the province where there are three million people living.
But Moually, he pointed out that the agreement had "a clear deadline" and expressed the hope that the military procedure would be directed at jihadists, including the fighters from Nusra Front, with a link to Al-Qaed, who would be "exterminated."
The United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mytura hopes that the first meeting of the new committee, composed of members of the government, and the opposition to the proposal of the postwar constitution for Syria, will soon take place.
Iually, he set the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "the control of the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning before intervention.
Why Trump wins in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win in the next elections in 2020, unless, as he probably hoped, many liberal observers, the prosecution and scandals of his office temporarily ended as president.
In such a case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidential period in history! ”
Until now, there are no signs of follow-up fatigue.
Since 2014, the ratings in the main broadcast time have doubled more than 1.05 million to CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average observation of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen and The Rachel Maddow Show, to MSNBC, has increased watching cable TV to 3.5 million following major night messages.
“It’s a heat that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the operator of the “Designed Explovor” on the ABC drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced author of comedy and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
“ He said, “Because he is funny,” said Mrs. Scovell.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, a story that takes place in Washington could predict the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can reconnect and to the benefit of the global economy.
Decomposition is a luxury that only the most privileged observers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond whether you're an informed citizen when you're watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses the "deep backup" resources for his book "Fear," the wheat leather jackets of Paul Manafort worth $15,000 ("gift dressing" as Washington Post said) and the consequences of Mr. Trump Stormy Daniels' disgusting imagery.
I, among other things, will not look again at Super Maria in the same way.
“Part of what he does and what makes you feel like a reality show is that he feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, head of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars document with a rotating c.F.L. Trump show in which he appreciates Kim Jong-una.
You can't miss one episode or you'll be behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny outside on the north bank of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was buried inside and watched MSNBC and recorded CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Court Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was about to come.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows and people said, "That's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money outside runs into the closest domestic races medium-term elections
It is no surprise that the 17th Precinct of Pennsylvania after experiencing a financial inflow due to the reorganization of congress districts that generated two office holders in the fight for the same chair.
This recently led to the reconstruction of the suburban district of Pittsburgh by District Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb – which acquired another district in a special spring election last year.
Lamb is opposed to another office holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is strongly outruned with the new 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania delivered its opinion in January that the old districts were uninterruptedly divided for the benefit of the Republicans, the map was re-painted.
The race in the new 17th district started a sharp financial dispute between the main party's financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the monitored March special elections to the 18th Congress District.
This chair has been occupied by the Republican for more than decades, and Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political experts give the Democrats a little lead.
America is considering fineing Salvador for China's support, then retreating
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing under mild pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was accommodated in a hotel in Panama until the partners court-martialed the organizational team of Trump's management.
The representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the U.S. diplomatic mission director from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “excessive decisions not to acknowledge Taiwan,” said spokesperson Heather Nauert, in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But fines were considered only against Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million US aid in 2017, including means to control narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included shortening financial assistance and focusing on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With ongoing internal negotiations, North American and Central American representatives postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which was described as a step forward in their efforts to prevent migrants heading to the US.
But by mid-September, the leading executives explained that they wanted to continue the negotiations and effectively complete any consideration for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of solving the conference currently scheduled for half of October, as part of the signal put forward by the administration at the meeting by diplomats.
And three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new unbreakable news from Washington.
The White House spokesperson, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their resources were confirmed by an external analyst, who is close to government enforcement and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
Robert Mueller's report from the Special Commission on the possible defense of Mr. Trump in the exercise of the law, which is now in public records, could be a definitive nail to the coffin.
In his investigation, Mr Mueller is also allegedly referring to whether Mr Trump's campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there was an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr Trump would have to turn himself in before this body, just as he is preparing to re-open before the voters, and eventually a jury composed of his colleagues would probably be waiting for him.
This is a whole series of "if" and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938 the German officers were prepared to put up against Hitler, only that the western powers would stand up to him and support him in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the imprecise course of democracy.
The Americans are now facing several critical moments.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, this is the man who runs Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's had it on since the report announced that he had secretly proposed to record the president last year and speculated that he was not in a state of health, so that he could hold the President's office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, The Times are imprecise.
"How will we react if the newly requested F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh's investigation is not complete or just – or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite convincing accusations of sexual assault and perjury?
And what is most important of all, are we going to vote in the middle of the term of office for Congress, which will assign responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait a long dark night.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me on a Sabbath to light candles on a swastika table.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
The Rangers on Thursday guests of Rapid Vienna knowing that the victory over the Austrians would give them an impressive draw on the Villarreal field in Spain earlier this month give them great hope of progress from the G Group of the European League.
Knee injury prevents Deputy Graham Dorrans from showing up on the field for the first time in the season until 2-2 with Villarreal. However, he believes Rangers can use the result as a reflection bridge for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team,” said 31-year-old player.
“We went into a fight with faith that we could grab something, and we took a point.
We may have been able to multiply it at the end, but overall, the tie was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half, we got better, and we were better again.
Thursday, it'll be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be hard, because they won a good result in the last match.
Last year was hard enough, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel very good about it here.
The team's strong, and the boys are really enjoying it, and training's good, too.
I hope we can get into it now, put the last season behind us, and we'll be successful."
Women are worried about retirement savings
While the participants had a clear idea of how they should be taken care of, few people spoke to family members about it.
About half the people in the national study stated that she had been discussing the long-term care with her partner.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they will not decide to discuss it with him,” explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not reveal your wishes to them.
Along with your advisor and family, discuss where and how to take care, because these factors can play a big role in determining the price.
Invite your financial advisor: The advisor can help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Funding long-term care can, for example, be used by a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help you pay these expenses or by using your own funds as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battles as long as you can.
Determine a health care representative, which will be a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that your doctors comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate yourself.
Also consider writing full authority for your finances.
You will choose a trustworthy person who will take financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not eligible for it yourself.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your old parent necessarily needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Write these details into your written plan to be ready.
"In the game, not just finances, but what are the doctors' names?" asked Martin.
“Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready by hand."

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase even further.
Since communication is out of service, auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Donggal Regent, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of earthquakes with a force of 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster broke out, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from the Pal.
Here are some key facts about Palu and the Donggala Regent, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi and its population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching along over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast on the northwest island of Sulawesi.
Regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main components of Central Sulawesi’s economy are fishing and farming, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
The production of nickel is also significant in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian organization, Disaster Miggation Agency has already hit Palu and Donggala several times the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami in Donggale killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
Tsunami struck the west of Donggala even in 1996 when she claimed nine victims.
Indonesia is located on a seismic pacific Fire Circle and regularly there is an earthquake.
Here's the list of several largest earthquakes and the tsunami of the last few years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and lost the lives of 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh Province.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and at the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6,8-degree earthquake hit the south of Indonesia's most populated island of Java and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: The 7,6 degree earthquake hit nearby Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: The 7.5 earthquake hit one of Mentawai islands, near Sumatra and caused a tsunami of 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Light earthquake hit Pidie Jay Regentship in Aceh Province and caused destruction and panic, as people resembled the devastating effects of a deadly earthquake and tsunami from 2004.
This time, no tsunami has formed, but more than 100 have died from falling buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaskan governor and vice-president of Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interference with domestic violence and arrest.
When, according to the police report, his female friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took Pali's phone.
Palin has been sent to the Mat-Su Pretral Facility and is detained for an unsolicited USD 500 bond, reports KTU.
According to the Network report, he appeared in a court on Saturday, where he declared that he felt “definitely innocent” when asked about the statement.
Palin is facing three Class A violations, which means that he could be sentenced to up to $250,000 a year in prison and to fines.
At the same time, he was charged with a class B violation punishing himself with a one-day prison and a $2000 fine.
It's not the first time that Palin has to face a criminal announcement.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged assault on the police has been reported by his mother, Sarah Palin, on the phone.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Court of War Veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, domestic violence and possession of weapons related to the incident.
Apparently, he hit his girlfriend's face.
Sarah Palinová was criticized in 2016 by groups of war veterans when she linked the violent behavior of her son to the post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on Friday on the island of Sulawesi.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks are off-line and in the coming days the number of victims is expected to rise.
The earthquake hit a part of Sulawesi, which is located northeast of the city of Jakarta in Indonesia.
Social media shows up videos showing a moment of disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a terrorist suspect in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are requesting a death penalty for Sayfulll Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died – an exceptional punishment which has not been granted for federal crime in the State since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly in October, he conducted an attack on a bicycle trail along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan using a rented Home Depot truck to sweep pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, the plaintiffs will have to prove that Saipov "intently" killed eight victims and "inadvertently" caused a series of injuries – this is how the conditions for the intention to grant a death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to the judicial documents, both of these figures would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the federal attack, the grand jury accused Saipova of 22 crimes, including, for example, murder charges in favour of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and preparation", claims the plaintiff and describes the way Saip's action was carried out as an abomination, cruel, and perverse."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendos and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,” he says.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District Court of New York last granted the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but in September 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when the marriage couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, who were shown a conspiracy in order to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs settled in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed in accordance with the judicial documents during the days and months following the attack minimal regret.
According to the police, he felt good about what he did.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to watch the Islamic state on the phone to commit an attack.
The police also published that they also demanded the hanging of the flag of the Islamic State in a hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "obviously disappointed" in the decision of the plaintiffs.
"We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and life sentence without release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
The Saip's defense team has already asked the prosecutor not to demand the death penalty.
According to Members, the Conservative Party should be entrusted with negotiations on Mr NIGEL FAAGE
During today's protest at the Conservative Party Conference, Nigel Farage committed to mobilize the army of the people.
The former Head of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians must “feel pressure” by Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s own Members suggested – should negotiate with the EU.
A numerous conservative MEP, Peter Bone, said on the march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be already out” if Mr Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in reconciling her ranks, where there is a deep conflict, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting for their stay in the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Rex in the city.
The Prime Minister is attempting to maintain his compromise plan from Chequers in the course of the attack of the supporters of Brexit, the supporters of the EU and the EU itself.
The partners insist that they continue to try to agree with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force the Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and its "chaos".
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave group would gather in Solihull where he wanted to leave to Chequers.
He proposed to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was at the forefront, we would already be outside today,” he said.
Member of Wellingborough added: ,I will stand behind Rexit, but we must bail on Chequers.’
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight the world war in order to have to listen.
In our own country, we want to do our own laws.”
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British citizens would change their minds and want to stand still is completely in the wrong place."
Conservative supporter of the Rexita Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the march, told reporters: "Just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unpopular to the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, and they do not like our party members and our activists who currently fill the streets to be elected at all.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.”
In Mrs May's sharp report, she says, "Ministers keep their place while they keep their promises."
Mr Farage stated that conservative politicians must get into an unpleasant situation if they wanted to betray their decisions adopted on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
“Now it is about trust between us – people – and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Rexit and we are standing here today to tell them that we will not allow you.”
In a report by an enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Rexite, to feel pressure.
“We are now mobilizing the army of this country’s people, who have provided us with a victory in the referendum on Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Great Britain, who owns it.”
Meanwhile, the supporters of the Union marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved the banners of the Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend launch of this party.
Labourist Member of Lord Adonis laughed at conservatives because of the security issues of the party's application after the opening of the conference.
“These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technologies for Canada plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Rexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to think on running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November elections, she would "think the presidential candidacy in order".
Boston Globe reports a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at the City Hall in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is attempting to re-elected November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself at the centre of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump sat in office.
One of the participants asked her whether she was planning to apply for the President's office.
Warren said that it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means a woman in the highest place.
He was arrested by a suspect from the shooting of Sims from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she arrested a suspect from shooting a basketball player at the LSU Wayda Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of the 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson, the 11:00th ET News Conference.
A video from the Friday shooting was released with a request for identification of a man captured on a recording.
Sims, 20, was shot on Friday mornings near Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which was inconsistencies with life,” reported Police Commander Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through the 247sports web.
Wayde was trying to protect his boyfriend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was moving at the crime scene, had a gun, and he confessed to the shooting of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was wiped out without incidents and taken into custody in East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Six feet and six inches high Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches, of which 10 were last season, and the average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps for the match.
The Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of world champion when the team directed him to the hands of victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished his Saturday qualification before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team's direction would play a big part in the race.
From the position field, Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners and called on Vettela to attack the team partner.
The Vettel went into the depot first and let Hamilton catch up with the wagons circling the group’s fury, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider drove into the depot by a round later and after the exit he joined the Vettela. However, Hamilton went ahead and in a close battle had to leave the Ferrari rider reluctantly to leave the inner path free so that he could defend himself in the third corner after double maneuver.
Max Verstappen left the rear row of the driving field and at the end of the first round he was on the day of his 21st birthday in the lead.
He then led for a large part of the race because he kept the original tires as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and could take Kimi Raikkonen fourth position.
Finally he went to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and rewards are the first two seats," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday meeting for insisting she didn't publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford to accuse the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech to the meetings in West Virginia, he did not directly mention Ford’s testimony to the Senate Court Committee, but he said that what was happening in the Senate, it shows that people are “bad and repulsive and detestable.”
“One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see that anger when you see those people angry and mean and disgusting and lying,” he said.
"If you look at the edition and the publication and they tell you, "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, is it your escape?
Remember her answer... you published the document - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, no, he did not," he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter to Ford with details of the charge against Kavanaugh in July and the information escaped in early September – but Feinstein refused to escape from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s statement, nor did I disclose the information on the case,” said Klomisi Feinstein, as reported by The Hill.
"She asked me to keep everything secret, and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, her words seem to be untrustworthy by the President who spoke to the case at the meeting on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this is a really bad speech of the body.
She may not have done it, but it's the worst speech I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the judge of the Supreme Court, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, and indicated that the Democrats are using these charges for their own ends.
“They are determined to take power back by any means available.
You see the meanness, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to stab into the country to get back to power and to the steering wheel," he quoted Mediaite the President's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars rectified Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants winning the Saturday retribution in Dundee, which ended in 5-3.
The Giants soon took the lead on a two-pronged team, thanks to the actions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to make up for homecoming before Dwyer returned the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard then settled for Dundee again, and two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen assured their victory.
It was the third defeat at the Elite League in the season for the Adam Keefe team, who managed to defeat 2-1 in Belfast Dundee on Friday.
Both teams met for the fourth time in the season, and all three previous matches were controlled by Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, in time 3:35, to assist Kendal McFaull, while David Rutherford credited his second goal to Beauvillelier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got his homemade back into the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cini, who compared at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabins for the first break after he recorded his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The house regrouped and the Bouchards managed again to match the goal of the power game at time 27:37.
The joint work of Cini and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen for the first time in the match overturn the lead on the Dundee side, and the same player assured the management of his team in the middle of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play the next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic managers died to allow hundreds of people aboard aircraft to escape earthquakes
Air traffic leader in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died while he supervised the plane with hundreds of people on board safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after the great earthquake that caused the tsunami on Friday, Sulawesi Island.
Strong aftershocks flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the ruins of Palu.
But even though colleagues of 21-year-old Anthonius Gunavan Agung were fleeing to save their lives, he refused to leave his post in a wildly rejecting control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at that time on the runway, is safe to take off.
Then he jumped from the control tower down when he thought he was moving.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson, told the television channel Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We have prepared transport by helicopter from Balicapan to Kalimantan, which was transported to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
In the meantime, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for the disaster management stated that access to Donggala, Simi and Boutong cities was limited.
"The number of deaths is still increasing, because many bodies are still unexplained under the wreckage and many of them have still not been saved," said the spokesperson of Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
Waves in the devastated Pala reached a height of up to six meters, and mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Both military and civilian aircraft bring assistance and supplies to affected locations.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News station: “Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies here.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small stores are stolen everywhere."
John Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the site.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military members of the country: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks that are needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" said CNN Station.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that after the plane crash in the lagoon, one person is missing
The airline operating a flight crashed in the lagoon on one of the micronist islands in the Pacific is now saying that one person is missing, indicating at the outset that all passengers and crews were safely evacuated from a scuba diving aircraft.
Air Niugini reported in her press release that on Saturday afternoon she was unable to find a traveling man.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to look for a lost man.
The airline did not react immediately to the requirements regarding the provision of details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane came into the water in an attempt to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said a total of seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the treatment on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
However, what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Air Force and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some of the Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed from a very low altitude.
"That was so good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that he and the others managed to get water through the deep belt to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He also said that the onboard staff was panicking and yelling and that he himself suffered a lighter injury to the head.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who worked nearby on port pier modifications helped rescue the inflatable boat to transport passengers to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that over the last two decades, a total of 111 persons have died in aircraft accidents with the PNG registration mark, but no accidents have occurred to Air Niuguni.
The analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution terminated its speech on Saturday in this case in which a man has repeatedly been tried by burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department in person of its analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours and provided expert reports in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury analyst drew a script of how he used records from the cell phone of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he received localization data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was on the evening of her death in Chambers, which was contrary to his previous statement, he wrote The Clarion Ledger.
When he was on the basis of the mobile phone data, he spent the night with Chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then the police visited him.
Sanford stood trial in court and testified that the day in question was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was lying because my car was in Nashville that night.
Another disagreement was that Tellis reported knowing Chambers about two weeks to the day she died.
However, mobile phone records indicate that the two only knew each other a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it completely from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected to get before the jury on the same day.
High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about this genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed band from Bristol claims that hip hop moved from its origins with political messages and addressing social problems.
So they want to go back to the roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have already encountered a recent recovery thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black girl?!
A NY teacher is suing a couple for his booty for a "racist" text message
A New York teacher is suing a couple for her discriminatory firing after she received a missubmitted text message from her mother, in which she was identified as the "other black" text message.
The couple refused that they were racists and compared the prosecution to "crying."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dismay when she found out on her first day at work in 2016 that Giselle Maurice's new tutor was black.
“NOSE — THE OTHER CHENCH,” she wrote. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she was sent by pi twice.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs Plasco-Flaxman “unfortunate” fired Mrs. Maurice and stated that she had been working really badly and that she had been expecting a letter from New York Post when she was leaving.
Mrs. Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing for a couple of compensation for getting out of work and asking for a compensation of 350 USD per day of six-month engagement, for which she was first hired, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not the case," she said this Friday, saying, "I know this is discrimination".
However, the couple returned the blow, not racists, but that the termination of Mrs Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her after the insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists," said her husband, Joel Plasco Post.
“But would you put your child in the hands of someone to whom you were rude, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco likened a "crying" suit and said that his wife only cared for a two-month-old child and was in "very difficult situation".
"Would you guys drive around like this?
That's not a nice thing," the investment banker said.
Although the court still persists, the jury on the social media very quickly condemned the couple for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of the stories about the pliptton bear were afraid that readers would not be able to identify with the talking bear, show the latest news
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said to the rapporteur: “It is difficult to feel in the situation of someone who first reads it before the publication.
But it's very funny to know now that we already know the tremendous success of Paddington Bear."
She stated that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before getting inspired to write a children's book about a small stuffed bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, added on the day of the 60th anniversary of the book publication, which became a "sugar" dot after his death last year.
She added that her father was very proud of his final success to the Paddington, described as “a very important member of her family. ”
“He was a rather quiet person, he was never proud,” she said.
“But since Paddington was such a real character to him, it was like you had a child who achieved something that you can truly be proud of.
I believe that the success of Paddington was looking at this look.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his successes to the Paddingtons alone."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
“He called me regularly to tell me that this is really bad and that he does not expect to get away with it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I had a call from Nada, where she told me she would die in the next two minutes, and I had to say good-bye.
That's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medication that the doctors gave her to keep her heart going slowly lost her effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything closed.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it inside."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is now grieved by her daughter’s loss, entered the plane together with other passengers without showing what a difficult test she is going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“ I held my head down, tears were running out of my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the flight when I felt a stunning understanding for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much power he loved her."
Crying women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending out the Welsh Bridge postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers on which people can search for support.
Tyler's son, Mrs. Davis, was only 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and, as a result, took his own life in 18 years.
“I wouldn’t want any other parent to feel what I felt every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that her son was a gifted young cook with an infectious smile.
“ Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile could light up every room."
However, before his death, he left work because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, 11 years old, found the immobility of his sibling after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis says: “I am constantly afraid of what this will affect his life. ”
She proposed postcards to “inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them even if they are their friends.
Don't sit silent - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is the old friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me that he felt at the bottom or depressed, nothing at all,” he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
The worst part was Christmas Day – when the children opened their gifts, never looked at them, nothing."
She stated that the death of her partner was a huge trauma to them, but that she had to get through it gradually: “This is the kind of thing she can do in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance the FBI is starting its investigation
“I thought we could get something that he actually asked for – an investigation in time of limitations, with limited scope – we could bring some unity into it,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would “fall apart” because both parties would bury themselves in livestock.
Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
The elections in the middle of the parliamentary term are only five weeks from us, on 6 November, and if the Republicans do badly, this will lead to their fundamental weakening in the attempts to enforce the requested man to a post at the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush was on the phone with the senators, lobbying with them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush, and then he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI compiles their report?
The Senate will vote on this and at present there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Penc to break the tie and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
The numbers of refugees from North Korea for Kim "declared"
The number of refugees from North to South Korea since the beginning of the reign of Kim Chong-Un has fallen seven years ago, claims the South Korean legislator.
Byeong-seug Park, quoteing data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that there had been 1127 escapes in the last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that there is more stringent controls at the border between North Korea and China and the higher rates required for smugglers at the border.
Pchjongyang did not issue any public statements.
The vast majority of North refugees today get an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Soul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has the longest border, and it is easier to cross it than in a heavily protected demilitarized band (DMZ) between both Korea.
China refers to refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees and often forced to repatriate them.
The relations between the North and the South – which are still technically in the state of war – have improved significantly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongjang for interviews that focused on the halted denuclarisation negotiations.
This happened in the historic June meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Chong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions for cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the US of making no progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no one-sided way to disarm ourselves," Mr Ri said in his speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said it was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the democratic minority, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that she was inappropriate for the service of the Supreme Court because of her temperament.
Pelosi made this comment in a Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not help myself, but if any woman had ever shown such a theatre, they would have called it “hysterical,” said Pelosi in her response to Kavanaugh’s Thursday statement to the Senate Court Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally refused all the charges that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both in puberty.
During his opening word, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he almost screamed and suffocated to talk about his family and his years in high school.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the committee and stated that their accusations against him were "grotesque and coordinated attacks" organised liberals who could not pass over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was presumptuous to the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and in a way that he was leaning on the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question of whether she would seek Kavanaugh's appeal in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had received a majority in the House.
“I will tell you this – if he does not tell Congress the truth, then he is not eligible not only for work at the Supreme Court, but also for the court he is working on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential proceeds in the Law on Acceptable Care or Roe vs Wade, because she was considered a conservative judge.
In the context of the hearings prior to his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided the answer to the question of reversing some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for a hysterical, presumptuous person to join the court and expect us to just say, "That's beautiful," said Pelosi.
And women have to rule it.
After verbal outbursts, months, and years of envy, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “A woman who was a director, who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, which means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: “Maybe you think I am crying because I am sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she continued.
And I think that's great."
The tears are acceptable as a means of responding to anger, partly because they are incomprehensible.
One of my most lively memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office where men were dominated, and once I expressed my unspeakable anger crying, but an older, always cold manager, who I was always a little afraid of, grabbed my neck and dragged me into the stairwell.
"Never show them you're crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in an illegitimate affair on the Monkey Business ship and had to withdraw from the fight. Mrs Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It was not a well thought-out decision," she said with laughter after 30 years.
“The seven other candidates have already run and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snower and seven dwarfs."
But because at that time the campaign had been running for a long time, it could not keep up with the acquisition of contributions and so it committed itself not to go into a fight unless it won a $2 million contribution.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as a expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, by frustration with a system that made her difficult to raise money and by focusing on the voters rather than delegates and anger over sexism, that she had completely strangled her with anger.
“Maybe you would think I had a nervous breakdown,” said Mrs Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
“And you might think that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they might write to me on the tombstone.
"Crying"?
Why Can It Be China-American Business War for Beijing Good
The initial US-China trade war hall was deafening, and although the battle is not nearly finished, according to experts between the cracks among countries in the long term, it was beneficial for Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, provided the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most significant escalations, however, have seen the light of the world this week, when new tariffs for goods were announced for USD 200 billion (EUR 150 billion), which means virtually half of trade exports from China to the USA.
Beijing reacted every time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of the 60 billion U.S. imports.
China has tried to retaliate the US with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world would kneel on its knees.
Although China would have wanted Washington to return to its original lines, it would have meant relenting his demands, but public submission to American demands would have been completely humiliating for Chinese President Si Jin Pching.
Even though experts think that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long term, as it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
“The fact is that fast political decisions by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic gulf in both countries. This is much more dangerous than the observers have admitted so far,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia in think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country destroyed by more than seven years of war.
When speaking at the UN General Assembly, Minister Walid al-Moual, stated that the conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation in the territory today is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorists into normal state.
All conditions for voluntary return of refugees forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now met, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million inhabitants still live in the country with the need for humanitarian aid.
Al-Moual said that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsored by the insurgents.
Europe has strongly responded to the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The Evria team won in the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the United States team with a final score of 16,5 to 10,5 on the Le Golf National field on the edge of trouble in France.
The US has now lost six in Europe, so it has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached 14.5 points that were needed for the defeat of the United States.
The US star, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then set off the ball in the water on the 3rd pair of 16th hole and let Francesco Molinari win.
The Italian golfer Molinari then shined in all his rounds and became one of 4 players and achieved the best result of 5-0-0 since the existing format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest rated player, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who apparently graduated from his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became overall the best European player with 25,5 points won for his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy to get my cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I am glad I could help," said Garcia after winning Europe.
He gave the cup to his compatriot John Rampo, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride to defeat Tiger Woods, but I grew up following this guy," Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now recorded a career record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time who has won 14 top titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The US team fought the whole weekend to find a fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed a top golf course throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing results of his team, Captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of these boys, I have really fought.
This morning, we really warmed Europe at heart.
We didn't really make it.
I'm cutting my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and, in cooperation with PGA of America, and Ryder Cup, we will move forward.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could be their captain.

Red Influence Updates: Concentrates are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to a decrease in the total red influx concentration in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, water blooming stains are now reported from the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this suggests a decreasing concentration.
The flowering water of the red tide has a range of about 130 miles of coastline from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee.
The stains were observed about 10 miles from the coast in the Hillsborough district, but last week it was relatively less of a place.
The red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
In the Hillsborough district, low to high concentrations were observed on the high seas, the lowest to high concentrations in the Manatee district, the lowest to high concentrations at the coast or the high seas in the Sarasota district, the lowest to medium concentration in the Charlotte district, the lowest concentration at the coast or at the high seas in the Lee district, and the low concentration in the Collier district.
The respiratory irritation continues to occur in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Airway irritation has not been reported in northwest Florida last week.
