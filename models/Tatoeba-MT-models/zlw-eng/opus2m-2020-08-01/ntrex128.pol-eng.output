The members of the Welsh National Assembly fear that they will be called muppets
Some of the members of the National Assembly are constituency. This is the result of a proposal to change their title to members of the Welsh Parliament, in short MWP.
The idea was based on plans to transform the assembly into a Welsh Parliament.
The members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become subject to mockery.
One of the parliamentarians in the Labour Party expressed his concern about his group, saying that the new name rhymes with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, the word "twp" means a fool, and the word "pwp" means departures.
One of Plaid Cymru's party politicians stated that its grouping was "unfortunate" from the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was "open" for a change of name, but he pointed out that the word "MWP" was very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter ‘w’ is similar to the letter ‘u’ in the English dialect Yorkshire.
As part of the assembly, the committee currently working on a draft law amending the name took the following position: "The final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will belong to them".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposal. The conversion of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of members of the Assembly to the "Wallian Parliament Member", i.e. the WMP in English, although the word "MWP" was the most popular among the public.
The members of the Assembly propose alternative solutions. The difficulty of reaching a consensus is a burden for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should present the bill in the weeks to come.
The reform law will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the principle of recalling members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the Act.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
On the next Sunday, the voters will decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help to put an end to a dispute with a neighbouring Greece over a decade, in which the Macedonian region is located.
The Government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor is a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia and the opponent of the referendum on the change of name said that he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, supporters of plebiscitus, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that change is necessary in order to enable you to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells in St.Marcin's New York church are silent in connection with the problems encountered by the churches in Harlem.
"The older people I talk to say that once there was a bar and church on every corner," said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's currently no sign of them."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Currently people provide themselves socially in a different way" – he noted.
"Bary is no longer a place for regular meetings of members of the community."
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not be sufficient for as long as decision-makers believe, and that "more or later they will be at the point of departure".
He added that churches can be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who will not support other temples around them.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of those buying housing in such buildings will be white; this will accelerate the total closure of the churches, because it is unlikely that new inhabitants will be members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by a congregation of white believers, before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the Church of St.Marcin joined the community a decade later).
The original White Methodist Assembly left the neighborhood in the 1930 ’ s.
The nearby African-American assembly took possession of the property of the building.
The Church of St. Marcin was taken over by a convention under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against sellers from 125th Street (the main shopping street in Harlem), opposed to the employment or promotion of African-Americans.
The 1939 fire damaged the building significantly, but the parishioners John Howard Johnson made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell team.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Marcin's Church, proudly called the new carylion "the bells of the poor".
In July, an expert in bells described it in a different way as "cultural treasure" and "unreplaced historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also noted that it was the world's first carylion served by black music. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he had a larger band waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Marcin's church didn't replace him.
In recent months, in the church of St.Marcin, there have been a series of complex events involving architects and performers, some of which have brought the secular leaders of the church to the place, and part of the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (a parish management body composed of secular leaders) directed its concern to the diocese, claiming that it “want to pass the costs on to the council,” although the council did not take part in the recruitment of architects and performers sent to the place.
Part of the parishioner also complains of lack of transparency on the diocese side.
A shark injured a 13-year-old diving in search of lobsters in California.
The authorities reported that last Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diving in search of lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the U.S. city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he dived with his friends when he heard a cry for help. Immediately with a group of friends they sailed to the boy to help get him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first he thought that the boy was excited to catch lobster, but soon he realized that the child was screaming: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
After reaching the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely torn skin around the collar.
"I began to scream to all that they would flee from the water: «There is a shark in the water!» – Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Children's Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, rescuer Captain Larry Giles said that the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious upper body injuries.
For security reasons, authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad for 48 hours, all the way to Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that there are over 135 shark species in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's shop network plans to expand its activities on the British cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's network throws a glove to stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing cosmetic chapters in their supermarkets related to the style of shopping houses as well as specially trained dealers.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market – which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to develop despite the declines in the fashion and household products – 11 online stores will be more regals with cosmetic products. If successful next year, the action will be extended to more points.
The return to the cosmetic industry is due to the search for ways to use the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer even 3,000 articles. The range will first include products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Currently sold articles from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas similar to those known even from Boots stores.
In addition, the network of supermarkets is planning to refresh their offer of Boutique makeup products. From now on, most of the articles will be vegan-friendly, as younger customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will create test points in two supermarkets Sainsbury's. The first was opened last week in Croydon, in the southern part of London, and the second was built in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The universality of online sales and daily purchases of small amounts of food in local shops makes supermarkets need to encourage customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, President of Sainsbury's, said that points of sale will increasingly resemble department stores, because the network is trying to fight disconcies such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos points in hundreds of stores and introduced a number of Habitat points since the takeover of both companies two years ago.
The previous attempt to reorganise the chapters of cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended with failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century Sainsbury's created a joint venture company from Boots to try. However, the cooperation was concluded following a conflict of revenue sharing from drug dealers operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's launches a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £ 125 million three years ago.
According to Lloyds, it will contribute to the plan by introducing an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four online stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the look and character of cosmetics departments to improve customer experience.
We have invested in special training for colleagues so that they can help consumers during their purchases.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to draw attention to customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question existing ways of making purchases".
Peter Jones "crazy" after he withdrew Holly Willoughby from a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, the TV star Dragons' Den, was "crazy" when he found out Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from a £11 million livestyle brand to focus on the renewed cooperation with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand offering accessories and household articles called Truly.
The activities were often compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave the prosperous lifestyle brand and to focus on the renewed cooperation with Marks & Spencer and ITV made by Holly Willoughby enraged Peter Jones, the Dragons' Day star.
As the sources report, Peter Jones was "crazy" when a popular television presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts of up to £1.5 million would not have time to devote their margin of accessories and household articles to Truly.
The company was compared earlier to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand. It was also expected to double Holly Willoughby's assets at £11 million.
After the announcement of the decision to leave the Truly brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram Peter Jones left Great Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source: “Marka Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She had a future with her and wanted to take care of her for decades to come.
The decision to withdraw from the activity completely surprised all those involved.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to entering the market.
The warehouse in Marlow is in place for sale."
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter to this Morning and one of the most successful stars in the UK could cost millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including articles from pillows to candles and household articles – as well as further delays in market entry.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby, along with Tara Capp, formed the Truly brand in 2016, and Peter Jones joined them in March as president.
The couple spent their holidays together, and Jones included 40% of the shares in the TV company of Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to become M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity program at the ITV station.
The source similar to Peter Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love with each other"
The president was joking about the criticism of media caused by the comment that some considered to be "unsatisfying husband of the state", as well as a positive relationship with the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a laughing voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
"I didn't give up anything."
The President pointed out that Kim Jong Un is interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was shouted by Trump with a large step towards the deuclerisation of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations are delayed.
After more than three months from the June summit in Singapore, the head of the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho, on Saturday, told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that he did not see the US's "analysed response" for early action by North Korea towards disarmament.
He noted that instead, the United States is maintaining sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We are doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim Jong Un have brought positive results: they have led to the end of the missile trials, helped release the hostages and return the remaining American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing his relationship with Kim Jong Un.
“It’s easy to behave in the President. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here,” said Trump, showing a finger for the crowd gathered right in front of us.
The tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia have completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people.
After an earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of the roof over the head by more than 10% of the people of Lomboku, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases the authorities made it very clear that they do not demand international support, so the situation is difficult," said Selina Subung.
Although Save the Children are preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, at the moment there is no certainty that international personnel will be able to operate at the site of the event.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Agency for Natural Disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu in order to verify whether aid from international organisations should be allowed.
In the face of the shocks in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although in the province of Aceh shelters were built in the event of a tsunami, they are rare in the case of the rest of the coastline.
The absence of a siren warning against the tsunamis in Palu – despite warnings – probably had an impact on the number of deaths.
Even under the most favourable conditions of travel between Indonesian islands, it is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed on the island of Lombok is headed for the help of earthquake victims to the city of Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the destination.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesian infrastructure as the main point of his campaign and allocated a lot of funds to roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year's elections, the President's administration is struggling with a lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure because of the continued religious tension in the country. Members of the Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of people lost their minds as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, arches, shots and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge wins a draw goal in a game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the English Premier League, winning a goal in the 89th Minute of the Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
Sturridge received an application from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's 1-0 state goal for the disadvantage of his team.
He put the ball on the left leg before taking the shot in the direction of the remote gate.
The ball sprung high above the penalty field towards the right upper corner of the net.
Then she fell into the gate, flying over Kepa Arizabalaga.
“I was just trying to take a position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri always try to move it as forward as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot opportunity,” said Sturridge in an interview for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kantego coming, I took the ball, and I gave the shot without any further thought."
Chelsea ran 1:0 in the middle of the game after the goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in the 25th minute.
The Blue Slayer kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovačicia, and then ran towards the middle of Liverpool.
Kovačić quickly accepted an application in the middle of the field.
He then performed a beautiful play forward in the criminal field back to the Hazard.
He outed the defenders and left footed the long pole of the shot, which passed by the goalkeeper Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napoli club in the Champions League group on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face the UEFA European League Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian natural disaster agency reported on Sunday morning, the number of victims of the recent earthquake and the tsunami in the country increased to 832 people.
During the conference, the spokesperson of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported that, as a result of a 7.5-degree earthquake on Richter scale, many people were trapped under the rubble.
The city of Palu, which is inhabited by over 380, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old suspect of a woman's stabbing
After finding the body of a woman this morning in Birkenauhead, Merseyside County, a homicide investigation was initiated.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street.
The police are asking for contact from people in the area who have seen or heard any suspicious events.
Brian O'Hagan, Commissioner for Investigation, said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal for contact with all those who are then near John Street in Birkenau, who have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I also address all drivers, in particular taxi drivers whose registries may have obtained material useful during the investigation."
The spokesperson confirmed that the woman lived in Birkenauhead and that her body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, those who claim to know a woman came to the scene to find out where she was found.
The police reported that he was in the process of informing the victim's family of the incident.
The taxi driver living in Grayson Mews recently tried to get into the residential building. However, he was informed by the police that access to the building and exit is currently prohibited.
He didn't say anything when he found out what happened.

Cromwell's monument to the British Parliament was the last victim in a dispute about "the writing of the story again"
The removal of the monument would bring justice for resembling the Taliban’s efforts to destroy many of its cultural and religious monuments by its radical, puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "trying to write history again".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the dispute over the character of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
In the course of the English civil war, it was neither commissioned nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps his forefather Thomas had earlier been determined to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The way in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell as a monument shows the view that this politician in the 19th century enjoyed, and that for many people he is still a figure worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in his interview for The Sunday Telegraph: “For many people Cromwell was perceived – perhaps more often in the 19th century than in the present – for defending Parliament against external pressures.
The evaluation, to the extent appropriate, is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
However, it is certain that the conflict with the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
In China, the farmer's crushing took place by a pig.
As the local media reports, there was a fatal attack on a farmer on the market in the south-western part of China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bloody and with an artery cut near the pigs at the marketplace in Liupanshui, Kueczou Province.
Pigs breeders are preparing for vaccination in pigs, on 30 May 2005, the city of Xining, in Qinghai Province (China).
According to reports, a man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, my cousin found a man's body and noticed an open door to a nearby pig.
He said there was a big pig in the booze with blood on his face.
The autopsy confirmed that it was a nearly 250-pound pig who had killed a farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and directed," said a man named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
You can see from the surveillance camera that Yuan arrived at the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man wasn't Yuan or his cousin.
The trade fair manager said in an interview for Guiyang Evening News that during the time of the gathering of evidence by the police, the pig was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the family of a man and the market authority are negotiating compensation for death.
Cases of pigs have already been reported, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, an almost 300-pound pig nailed a farmer to a tractor.
After eating a farmer from Oregon by pigs in 2012 one of the farmers in Manitobie told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can liberate brutal behavior in them.
"They just want to have fun.
They're as inquisitive as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the right respect," he said.
The remains of the storm Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the south-west part of the United States
According to the forecast, hurricane Rosa is losing power moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days it will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the south-west part of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa blows at almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 Eastern Time he was given Category 1. He was then 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
As forecast Sunday, Rosa will move north.
In the meantime, over the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form than it is heading east on the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will be approaching the California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the mass of damp air north to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in the part of Mexico.
In the following days wet tropical air coming into contact with the nearest rain will cause rain in the south west of the United States.
In some places, precipitation from 2.5 cm to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, pollution movement and possible flooding in desert areas.
Moisture tropical air will cause precipitation from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even from 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the South West, especially over a large part of Arizona.
Due to the widespread nature of tropical precipitation, sudden floods and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
In view of the threat of tropical rain, it is strongly advised to walk on the desert.
Extensive rains can turn canals into river wreaks, and lightning storms will cause local gloomy winds and dust shifts.
Coming before it brings abundant local rainfall on the coast of southern California.
Rains with a total height exceeding 1.3 cm are possible, which may cause minor pollution and dangers on the roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
On Monday afternoon and Tuesday, the precipitation will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western United States and last until Wednesday.
In October, with the cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, there may be temperature fluctuations, but in the intervertebral zone it will be more warm.
This may lead to rapid changes in temperature at small distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature difference in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska State) and St. Louis (Missouri State) and Des Moines (Iowa State) these differences are almost 10 degrees Fahrenheit.
In the coming days, persistent summer temperatures may rise again.
In the large central and eastern parts of the United States, a warm beginning of October is expected. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to part of the North East.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit, about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term climate forecasts show a high probability of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogations
More than 20 million people were watching in six television stations, moving on Thursday's audition for a judge of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, commentators had to stop regularly broadcast programmes in order to inform them of an emergency: the agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate judicial committee that she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh was repressing her in a state of indigestion and trying to remove her clothes during the high school event.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that such a situation had not taken place.
It is possible that Friday's number of TVs was even greater than Nielsen's 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC TVs.
However, no figures were available for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen is usually difficult to measure visibility among workplaces.
The given number is similar to the ratings of the American Football Cup or the awarding of the American Film Academy.
According to Nielsen's reports, Fox News Channel station, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest ratings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers per day in the hearing.
In second place there was ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake became a key figure of Friday's events.
In the morning he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after the office of this moderate Republican had issued a statement that he had decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. On the recording he was yelling at protestors who made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on the way to the hearing of the panel of justice.
Flake, with his head down for a few minutes, listened to unfavorable opinions, and the whole event was broadcast by the CNN station.
"I stand here before you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the nation the truth?
You have the strength in the face of so many women's incompetence" – you have heard from a demonist woman.
Before the elevator door closed, Jeff Flake said that his office issued the appropriate statement and that he would speak during the hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events pending a vote on the transfer of Kavanaugh's nomination before the entire Senate.
Flake said he'd only support the nomination if he knew the FBI was going to investigate the charges in the coming week, and the Democratic minority insisted.
Flake was convinced, in part, by talking to his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting Chris Coons and some other senators.
Flake's choice was important because the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into charges against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit to their own advantage
In her interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union for the future of Britain and undermine national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Birmingham Conservative Party (United Kingdom), September 29, 2018.
In another interview, next to Theresa May, the former Foreign Minister in her government, Boris Johnson, attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union in the wake of Brexit, according to which the United Kingdom and the EU could collect duties on their behalf, calling it "totally ridiculous".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson suspect for the murder of a LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the colours of the University of Louisiana (LSU).
According to reports from the Baton Rouge police station, 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and placed in custody under second-degree murder.
The authorities published a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS, police officers found these glasses on the spot and detected traces of Simpson's DNA.
The police reported after Simpson's interview that he confessed to shooting Wayde.
As the defendant's lawyer handed over, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the Coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report that caused a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police officer expressed her gratitude to the search party of Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the state police, the Southern University police and the local residents for their assistance in investigating the arrest.
Joe Allewa, LSU sports director, thanked local law enforcement for "work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
His father Wayne Sims also played basketball in LSU.
In his last season he recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 matches.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach from LSU Will Wade said that the team was "grezgotane" and "shivered" by Wayde's death.
"That's one of the things we're constantly afraid of," said Will Wade.
Ashes emitted by a volcano reach Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the national disaster prevention centre advised Mexicans to move closer to the volcano as a result of increased activity in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The Centre has experienced many strenghts and shocks.
Photographs published in social media show windscreens of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in Mexico’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-degree earthquake that followed Mexico in September 2017, geophysics have seen an increase in volcano activity of 72 km south-east of the country's capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Start of the police with the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of the defeat of protesters supporting the independence of Catalonia with police prevention troops. On that day thousands of people participated in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extreme referendum on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked separation supporters threw away eggs and powdered police officers. Dark clouds of dust filled the streets usually full of tourists.
It also occurred in the later part of the day. In order to stop the fight, police forces used sticks.
For a few hours, groups supporting independence chanted “We do not forget, we do not forgive,” and the opponents of the secession cried, “Let Spain live. ”
According to the local press, 14 people received medical assistance in connection with minor injuries during the protests.
After a year from the referendum of 1 October, tension does not weaken. Although the Madrid authorities found it illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for those seeking secession of the Catalans.
Most of the voters voted for independence, but the turnout was low due to the vast boycott of the opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in violent clashes with the police, trying to prevent voting in electoral stations.
On Friday night, a group of people supporting independence in the region decided to prevent demonstrations supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, but it was forced to change the route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and his wife involved in the protest of separatists, said that there is no longer hope for the independence of Catalonia.
“ Last year, we had one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents were happy to vote, but now we're stuck in a place without leaving," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in local elections in December last year, parties supporting the secession of Catalonia have difficulty continuing their action. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or await a trial in connection with the role played in the referendum and later the announcement of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old mechanic recording a police-support protest on the phone, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute are instigating conflict.
"The situation is becoming more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders held in custody from the end of last year, announced his wish to launch in the next year's elections to the European Parliament.
"The candidate for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the democratic values of the Spanish Government" he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested following a multiple car hit in a house in Londonderry.
The event occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 British Time (BST).
Commissioner Bob Blemmings of the Investigation and Investigation Department said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point, a crossbow shot could also have been fired.
Mengi Gate provides Livingston Win over Rangers 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston brought the team a victory
Since this season, Livingston's extra-class livestone club has framed the Rangers, giving Steven Gerrard only a second defeat in his 18 matches as a coach of the club from Ibrox Park.
The gate of Dolly Mengi turned out to be a winner, and Gary Holt's band moved to second place in the table with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains in this season without winning the Premiership. On Sunday next Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, to which they lose eight points.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers will be visiting the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA League of Europe.
Livingston extends the series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt has not been defeated since being replaced last month by Kenny Miller.
Livingston missed a few opportunities against undisposed opponents.
Holt's team should have been in charge much earlier, because the band's game has caused a lot of problems to Rangers.
First Scott Robinson got through the defense and put a shot in the light of the goal, but he couldn't shoot a goal, and then Alan Lithgov didn't get the head of Craig Halkett.
The hosts allowed Rangers to play closer to the goals, knowing that they could threaten the rivals during the constant pieces of the game.
And that's how the determining goal fell.
After the Rangers fired a free team Livingston found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the situation of Menga, who gained a goal from the center of the criminal field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they couldn't push the defenses, and they didn't cause any major problems for the goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos fired one shot at Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by the Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgov was unable to reach the light of the gate from the next permanent passage he was sentenced to Livingston.
The Rangers continued the attacks in the Livingston criminal field, but they couldn't take advantage of the situation.
"Fenomenal" Livingston performance – Analysis
Alaska Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played great once again beyond expectations.
Their style and composition almost changed from returning to the extraclass. However, Holt should be appreciated for encouraging the team to play.
This match had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a great organizational defense. Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell very careful throughout the game.
Rangers had no will to fight.
While they had great moments under Gerrard's leadership, they didn't keep up with their standards in the game.
In their game it seemed to be missing something: only once managed to break through the defense of the hosts. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers who found themselves in the center of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit in Cologne
During the Saturday breakfast in Berlin (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany accompanied the smiles and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of improving the relationship between NATO allies.
The disputes led to differences in human rights, freedom of the press and accession of Turkey to the European Union.
After the meeting Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
The largest number of Turks live in this city outside their homeland.
According to the police, for safety reasons, 25 thousand crowds were blocked from gathering in front of the temple, but the president's supporters gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, including many Kurds, also decided to express their opinion, condemning the policy of the Turkish leader and the decision of the German government to adopt policies in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the divisions that the visit of a hero to be called by some Turks living in Germany and recognized as autocrat by others.

Long Lartin Penitentiary: Six officers have suffered injuries as a result of riots
As the authorities report, six officers have suffered injuries as a result of riots in a male penitentiary with a higher level of security.
HMP Long Lartin's penitentiary riots in Worcestershire started on Sunday at 9:30 British Time (BST) and are still ongoing.
Eight prisoners in one of the wings of the establishment were called to start up with a specialist unit called "Tornado".
The officers on the scene suffered minor facial injuries.

Sudden floods caused by Rosa hurricane threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (probably beneficial impact on dry areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach Arizona's state, which is likely to occur at the beginning of next week. The rest of the storm Rosa travel through desert areas of the South, creating a threat to sudden floods.
National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of an emergency flood on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast Tuesday Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon, the rainfall will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that “from 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of the storm or tropical depression at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from the state border of Arizona".
The latest models of National Hurricane Center forecast precipitation from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas, Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach up to 15 cm.
In the remaining desert areas of the South West – including in the middle Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin – the amount of precipitation is likely to be from 2.5 to 5 cm and in some areas to 10 cm.
People from outside the areas at risk of sudden flooding can bring relief to hurricane Rosa, as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where drought conditions exist.
As reported in the Weather.com portal, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of Arizona's area is struggling with severe droughts belonging to the second of the highest categories.
Hurricane Rosa will first arrive on the California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with hurricane force, reaching a speed of 137 km/h. Currently it is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane is experiencing colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to fall.
According to forecasts, it will strike Mexico with the power of tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Intensive rainfall in some parts of Mexico may pose a major flood risk.
The Weather.com reported that “in the area from California to the northwestern part of Sonora, precipitation is expected from 7 to 15 cm, although it may reach 25 cm".
Then the hurricane Rosa will cross Mexico in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early morning, it will reach the border of Arizona as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening it will travel to the southern part of the state of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by storm Rosa or its remains is a very large amount of rainfall on the peninsula of California, in the north-western part of Sonora and in the south-western areas of the United States of America,” reports the National Hurricane Center.
Rain forecast will cause life-threatening sudden floods and pollution in the desert and mud avalanches in the mountainous area.

Trump stated that Brett Kavanaugh “recognized anger and anger” of the Democratic Party
"The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the absolute and repulsive conduct of the Democratic Party," said Trump on the Wheeling Tower, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh “recognized anger and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before the convention. He firmly and emotionally denied Christina Blasey Ford's accusations. A woman claims that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on the charges she filed.
On Saturday the president said that on that day "Americans could find out about the brilliance, the class and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of the support of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, an expert in the law of great merits for the community," he said before the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, discussing the importance of participating Republicans in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important choices in our lives.
I do not start these elections, but I remain very active" - he said.
"I'm still fighting to defend our wonderful candidates."
Trump claims that Democrats are engaged in a policy of "resistance and difficulty".
As CNN said, one of the assistants of the important Republican Party policy, the first key Senate vote on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of earthquake victims and tsunamis in Indonesia.
As the authorities reported on Saturday, at least 384 people died – many of which were kidnapped by high waves collapsing about the beaches – following a strong earthquake and tsunami that visited the island of Indonesia in Sulawesi.
On Friday in Palu hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival city. At dusk, waves reached even 6 meters high hit the shore, kidnapping many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat occurred yesterday, people on the beach did not escape immediately and fell victim to the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian natural disaster agency BNPD.
“Tunami attacked everything on his way, stealing cars, logs and houses,” reported Negroho, adding that before reaching the coastline the element moved at 800 km/h at sea.
As he said, some of them were saving themselves by climbing the trees, and they managed to survive.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
A number of damaged houses and shops, damaged and damaged bridges and a mosque surrounded by water are seen in the aerial photographs published by the natural disaster agency.
On Saturday, the coastal city visited secondary shocks.
A number of earthquakes occurred in the area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) the energy released by a large Friday earthquake was about two hundred times greater than the nuclear bomb that was thrown into Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement states that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bay, could have increased the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He then added that the bodies of parts of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
Nugroho said that deaths and damage could be higher along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake epicentre.
According to Nugro, the communication "has been completely paralysed", and there are therefore no reports from Donggala Province.
"More than 300 000 people there" – read in the Red Cross statement. It was also added that employees and volunteers of organisations went to places affected by the disaster.
“We can now talk about tragedy, although the situation may be severe,” states the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism due to a lack of information on the tsunami hit in Palu. However, the authorities reported that the waves came just after the warning.
On the amateur social media video, you can see a man screaming from the building, trying to warn about the upcoming tsunami of people on the street.
In a few minutes, the water wall crashed on the shore, kidnapping buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused significant shortages in electricity supply, preventing communication within the Palu. This in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
According to the military authorities, transport aircraft with the assistance of Jakarta and other cities has begun, but evacuators still very much need food and other essential articles of the first need.
The airport in the city was opened exclusively for humanitarian services. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is to visit centers for people evacuated in Palu.
Over 800 victims of tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As Doseb T. Sinay reported, the national director of the World Vision, the staff of this organization made safe from Donggala Province to Palu City and found refuge in tents from the brozent located in the courtyard of the office.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some of the groups are slowly starting to help, there have been criticisms that travel to Palu is impossible for workers of foreign humanitarian organisations with rich experience.
According to Indonesia's law to receive funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only be started after the disaster is announced by the national disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
"officially, we are still dealing with a regional disaster" said the spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government considers that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to receive international aid, but this has not happened."
After two days of the Friday earthquake and the tsunami in Palo, friends and families of missing persons continue to hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescue workers released a woman who spent two days under the rubble of her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders to take part in the end of this month in Indonesia Asian Games.
As Petra Mandagi said, other people trapped in Roa Roa were his disciples.
"As an experienced paraglider, I struggle with my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon Subandono explained how, within a few hours of the arrival of information among the paragliders about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he was desperate to send messages by the WhatsApp communicator to athletes taking part in the beach festival.
His messages are marked with only one gray hook instead of a pair of hooks in blue.
"I think that means that messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole 26 750 USD while filling up cash in an ATM in Newport on the Left shopping center
According to a report from the Newport police station on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee, who was supplementing cash at the ATM in Newport on the Levee's shopping centre.
“The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to complete the cash,” wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in his release.

According to a report, witnesses saw some suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police didn't tell you how many people were involved in the the theft.
All persons with information on the identity of thieves are requested to contact the Newport police command at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
When he announced his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “A person previously known as Kanye West.”
Forty years, the musician has used the pseudonym Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change took place before visiting Saturday Night Live. It is expected that during the performance the artist will present his new album, Yandhi.
He will replace Ariana Grande, a singer who, according to the creators, gave up "for emotional reasons".
West had already stated that the word "Ye" is not only a shortcut from his current artistic nickname, but is of religious significance.
“It seems to me that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible. It means “You” in the Scriptures,” said West earlier in the year, discussing the title of an album with a radio presenter named Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – reflecting all our good, bad and confused qualities.
The album shows who we are."
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West associate, also wrote his alias in various ways, with a connection, without a link and in capital letters.
President of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador commits not to use the military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of student demonstrations, President of Mexico andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) committed never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, at Trzech Kultur López Obrador Square, he promised "never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the square in the direction of peaceful demonstrations, killing even 300 people.
López Obrador promised to support the young people of Mexico, providing monthly financial assistance to learners, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of learning opportunities of young people's pride towards criminal groups.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence research
As Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and expert in artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, together with the increase in China's activity in this area, the United States should double its investment in SI research.
The comment made is related to the announcements on artificial intelligence published by various United States government agencies, although the US does not have an official SI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China has presented its plan, according to which they want to be the most innovative country in the area of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"At first, the SI research budget should be doubled: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," said Kai-Fu Lee.
In his interview this week, the CNB also said that doubled funding could double the chances of making another breakthrough in the area of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month, is the president of Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most significant artificial intelligence companies in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an SI system that defeated the best American player in Othello. He then held a leading position at Microsoft Research and was the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognised the success of earlier technology initiatives by the US government, e.g. the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Area (DARPA) of the competition for the most interesting robot projects.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government subsidies.
"It is not China that receives the best representatives of academic communities, but corporations," said Lee.
For several years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, change in immigration policy could also help the United States to develop SI.
"I believe that people with artificial intelligence who have received a doctor's degree should automatically acknowledge a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create artificial intelligence for the next generation.
As Lee noted, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a way similar to the US National Science Foundation and other government organisations granting funding to American scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
In the earlier years, the United States Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre for artificial intelligence (Joint Artificial Intelligence Center), which will engage partners in the work of the world of industry and science.
This month, DARPA also informed about the allocation of USD 2 billion to an AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing more than USD 100 billion per year in the SI research.
At the same time, the US initiative to set up a national committee on the security of artificial intelligence has not moved forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would enable the country to settle a few decades of dispute with Greece, which blocks its efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the historic country of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has therefore argued that the country should be joined to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on the nomenclature, but nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavian majority of Macedonia.
The president, Mr Ivanov, said that he would not vote. The boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the attendance would reach the minimum level of 50% required to accept the referendum as binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, say that it is worth paying the price for joining Macedonia – one of the countries after the fall of Yugoslavia – to organizations such as the European Union and NATO.
"I voted in favour of the future of my country so that young people of Macedonia can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us all with greater security," said the 79-year-old Owwartra Georgiewska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that it respects the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two thirds of Parliament's members.
The state electoral committee has informed that no unusual events were reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at this time was only 16% compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections.
"I voted for my children. Our place is in Europe," said the 62-year-old Christian Tanewski, the voter from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of the country Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and the son of Duszko spoke in a referendum on the change of the name of the country to open the road to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and set up chairs in front of tents spread by the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and EU membership, but we want to join these organisations with a head-deep, not the back door," said Kawardarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can address other countries such as China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew claims that NATO membership will bring about the necessary investments in Macedonia with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will support a change of name in the referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaw said after voting.
He said that the vote for "yes" was "the confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Public Research Institute, from 30 to 43% of voters declared their wish to participate in a referendum, which is less than the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV Telma TV in a Sunday referendum, 57% of respondents are planning to vote.
70% of the survey said it would support a change of name.
In order to succeed, the vote must be 50% + 1 vote.
Failure in the referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the Western government since last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City beats Brighton's entire defense and wins the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton home in a Saturday meeting with a result of 2:0 for Manchester City. The match was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The gate obtained by Aguera in 65 minutes seemed very easy.
The action started with an application in the middle of a field to an Argentine attacker.
The ballman outrun three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was among the four Brighton players.
First, he won one of them, then outrun the others, and he found himself on the edge of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he played the ball to the left where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English attacker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in a criminal field that defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the goal.
“Aguero faces foot injury,” said the manager of Manchester City Pep Guardiola.
“We talked about options to play 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he had won the goal at that time."
However, Sterling provided the blue first lead in the Premier League.
The gate in question fell in 29.
In the action of this Aguero, he got the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a wonderful pass along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to the long pole.
Manchester City's attacker directed the ball to the grid just before it hit the cars.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the UEFA Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. The meeting will take place at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of winning Rockies
After losing the chance to participate in the playoff phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer, he did not have to appear in the first lineup.
However, the loving competition Scherzer hopes to be in a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies if only the Rockies retain the chance to perform in the playoffs. Currently, the team has one more victory than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Division.
Rockies can count on a wild card at least if they win Friday's meeting against Nationals result 5:2. However, they still want to get their first title champion of the division.
"Although we play "about nothing", at least we go out on the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of opponents will be at the highest level as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in this meeting."
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday's meeting, but the team is leaning towards putting Scherer in the first lineup.
It would be the thirty-fourth performance of Schererra in the first lineup. The player took part in Thursday’s jet training and hopes to appear on Sunday.
The right-hand fighter from Washington recorded the results of 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300 times and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trumpa in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court judge, discussing the importance of participating Republicans in the midterm elections.
"In November, we put all our achievements on the line.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I do not start, I remain very active. I constantly defend our wonderful candidates," he said.
He then continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions with our own eyes.
They are determined to take power with all means possible.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to hurt in order to gain power and control.
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out a mission of "resistance and difficulty".
"It has been very good to see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad, mean, unpleasant and untruthful."
The president referred to the Senate Committee of Justice, referring to the name and name of the U.S. Senator from the Dianne Feinstein Democratic Party, which encountered a loud buzz from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the release of the document?
«Uh, I'm listening?
No... I mean... no». Her body language was terrible. It was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to people expressing their own opinions
When the Momentum activists in my party voted for giving me the naked, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am a member of the Labour Party Group, which was recently said that they are not welcome, and all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the application for a naked woman was based on a difference of opinion between Jeremy Corbyn and me.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. As for the irony of fate, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
The Friday announcement on the meeting of the parliamentarians of the Labour Party in Nottingham East reads: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years I have served as a Labour Party, the majority of the afternoon meetings of the General Committee looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now going on differently. Many years have been forgotten about the promise of a more warm and milder policy, as long as it has ever been remembered.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed for compliance with the management of the party.
It all started soon after Jeremy Corbyn's president's position, and colleagues who thought that we had similar views began to expect me to change directions and to take positions that I would not agree with before, with issues such as national security or the EU single market.
After every public speech – regardless of the content – I meet in social media with attacks calling for nominations, condemning centralism or leaving the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I'm addressed to are more of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexual or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to day-to-day order with insulting others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every request for "the amount of distrust" and any change in the rules for choosing a party's view, the party's view is narrowed down.
Over the last two years, I have been repeatedly suggested not to shrink or silence certain issues, and then everything would be "fine".
That is not why I have taken up politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the neglects of Margaret Thatcher's government, which led to the collapse of my school class, I am trying to ensure better quality of public service for those in need – both as local councillor and minister.
I've never covered my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew about the differences in opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported the Friday proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the president of the labour market in the face of the upcoming Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services.
The most important message, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to be able to serve you. I promise that no threats to the withdrawal of nominations or ad hoc political objectives will discourage me to act in accordance with your convictions and in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17 – Undefeated Ayr again by the mountain
There is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved a victory in this very interesting game of Scottish extraliga.
The team is number one on the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, this outstanding defence and better use of opportunities led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied with his care workers.
“The previous games have been a challenge for us, but we are still unbeatable, so I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: "We need to pay respect to the Ayr players.
Ayr was led in 14 minutes by Grant Anderson and increased Frazier Clime. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes's Scot which came to the team from Glasgow Warriors allowed Melrose to settle the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused chance to raise.
Climo increased the lead of Ayr after kicking from the penalty line just before the end of the first half. First, he gained the touch, and then took the opportunity to raise, obtaining a score of 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose has well begun the second half, and the landing of Patrick Anderson, raised by Baggotot, has reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a long stop due to Ruaridh Knott's severe injury. The player was removed from the field on the stretchers. After the Ayr resumption, he increased the lead when Stafford McDowall was mounted and the Clim was raised.
Afterward, the captain of the Ayr Blair Macpherson team received a yellow card. Melrose re-used his numbers: the attachment to Bruce Colvin’s unused attempt to increase the lead reduced the lead.
The hosts took over the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for beating Clima without a ball. MacPherson got a hold on the back of the upcoming defense.
Climo took a chance to raise, and then again he managed to raise the score just after the game was reinstated when Kyle Rowe caught the shot from the penalty shot and allowed wingman Gregor Henry to win the fifth pitch for the host.
Still Game star starts his career in the gastronomy industry
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems to be starting up in the gastronomy industry. Recently it was discovered that he was the director of a restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis at the BBC's popular sitcomie station. He has performed and cooperates with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last in the history of the series. It all suggests that Ford Kiernan is planning the future after he left "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this subject, however, informant Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in a “growing gastronomic industry” in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": without access to the sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The Navy is patrolling the Navy base in La Paz.
Blue flags come from public buildings.
In the ports of the Navy from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the following motto is: “The sea is ours under law.
His recovery is our duty."
The memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of resources of the 19th century is still alive. Just like the dreams of re-shiping the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the largest in a few decades, and Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which is to be issued on 1 October following a five-year trial.
“The activities of Bolivia are a distraction. Residents are unanimous, optimistic and count on a positive verdict,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians all over the country will be watching a meeting of the International Court of Justice. They hope that an organization based in the Hague will recognise the claim of Bolivia and, after decades of fruitless discussions, Chile will have to negotiate on the granting of an independent sea access state.
Eva Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who, next year, is in a position to stir up a controversial struggle for re-electation, also hopes that Monday's judgment will take place.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts claim that the chances of favouring Bolivia are small and that even a favourable decision would not change much.
The United Nations Organisation, based in the Hague, is not entitled to grant Bolivia to Chile. It also guaranteed that it will not affect the determination of possible talks.
As Paz Zárate, a Chilean international legal specialist, said, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be taken six months after the final arguments were put forward.
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to get the country away from the target for the last four years.
“The question of access to the sea was taken by the current Bolivian administration,” said Paz Zárate.
A relentless rhetoric by Morales deprived the Chileans of any remnant of goodwill, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their conversations at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
The ambassadors have not been replaced since 1962 for both of these countries.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in the Hague, did not agree with the opinion that the decision-making process of the court was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new age in terms of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending 139-year-old dispute with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, used the subject of access to the sea as part of the political game.
“Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
"The judgment is an excellent opportunity to believe that we must deal with the past".
North Korean rulers say that nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, states that his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore Summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seemed to be at the edge of the renewal of suspended nuclear diplomacy over three months after a meeting in Singapore with the head of North Korea, Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that the "murson" is that the absence of sanctions and the U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war has ever thrown North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign a declaration without taking concrete disarmament steps by Pjongyang.
Both Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread scepticism as to the fact that Pjongyang is serious about the dissolution of the arsenal that is perceived in North Korea as the only means of guaranteeing security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pjongjang next month in preparation for the Kim-Trump second summit.
Paris’ fashion shows reveal the appearance of the latest line of great headgear in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely cover yourself in front of the sun, then we have good information for you.
Valentino and Thom Browne's fashion designers presented a series of crazy, over-dimensional headgears in their 2019 summer collection that shone in style during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
These designers decided to present their stunning creations on the run.
Valentino’s outstanding work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathery jacket, flooding models’ heads.
Other non-dimensional accessories included watermelons decorated with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple — but they were not designed to heat their head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of strange masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter's style than a haute cockur.
One creation looked like diving equipment with pipes and glasses, and another looked like melted ice creams.
And if you don't want to break with great fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats can go to clothing stores.
The non-dimensional hats go right for "La Bomba", a straw hat with a width of 61 cm, which everyone had already worn — from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which was passed through social media, presented another great creation — a straw beach bag almost as large as the swimwear model wearing it.
The tan orange bag with Rafia, finished with raffia fringes and finished with white leather handle, was distinguished in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the 2019 summer season during the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a stylist of the stars, said FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in stores of the following summer — as the designer has managed to exert such a great influence, it would be difficult not to use demand for over-dimensional accessories.”
John Edward: linguistic skills necessary for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements — in 2018, they could boast of another excellent exam results, based on individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other social projects.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is represented by over 30,000 students throughout Scotland to provide the best level of services to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career pathways and to identify their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that is able to develop and implement a school-friendly learning programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another man in a language he understands, then it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes into his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that the languages take first place in league rankings, with the highest level of subsidisation rates for independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who were learning foreign languages received a higher rating of A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS Member States showed that 72 percent of pupils received a higher rating A in Mandarin, and 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also obtained an A rating.
This shows that schools independent in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as a choice, is conducted in the same scope as the science of STEM (scientific science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the course of curricula in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that 17 percent of the lack of language skills of candidates was responsible for the reason of the difficulties in filling job vacancies by employers.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more necessary to prepare young people for their careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language skills,
Lifelong skills, such as learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future, irrespective of the career path.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to competition.
According to the 2013 survey of YouGov, with more than 4,000 adults in the British, 75% of them could not speak well in the foreign language to speak well enough, and the French language was the only language of which the percentage of people in use was two-digit, i.e. 15%.
That is why investing in teaching foreign languages is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding adequate employment.
In Scotland, each school will vary in terms of the languages it teaches.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered essential to the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interest, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from, which will be taught by specialised teaching staff in this area.
The Scottish independent schools are involved in creating a teaching environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to be successful — whatever the future is preparing for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages are still crucial for the future of the country in the international business environment, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer a large choice, diversity and level for Scottish youth.
It's just how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut on the Lakers team on Sundays in San Diego.
The fans who wanted to see LeBron James' debut in Los Angeles Lakers were finally there.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that LeBron James would play a Sunday foreplay against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
You don't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
"More than one but less than 48", said Walton on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers Reporter, Mike Trudell, said on Twitter that James is most likely to be playing for less than a minute.
After the training, which took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-term Lakers matches.
“At this stage of my career, I do not need to participate in pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
So Trump's voter in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting tonight at Wheeling in West Virginia with a series of voters.
It is the first of the five electoral towers planned by Trump that will take place next week, along with attitudes in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote confirming his election to hold a vacant position in the Supreme Court of Trump, he seeks to build support in the upcoming elections in the middle of the government, because the Republicans may be threatened with losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time will it be tonight, so the trumpet voters in West Virginia, and where will they be able to watch it on the Internet?
So Trump's vote in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place at 7 p.m. on Saturday 29 September 2018.
So the electoral Trumpa in West Virginia will be able to follow live online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week's hearings of a candidate nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who had been held in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of sexual abuse, as well as the anticipated vote in the Senate on suspension of the choice for a maximum of one week, for the time of the FBI's investigation.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral elections is to support the Republicans in the face of difficult November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign with five towers next week aims to "mobilize volunteers and supporters to assist the Republicans in protecting and extending the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives" — Reuters.
"The control of Congress is such an important point in the President's schedule that he will visit as many states as possible as possible as he is approaching the hottest season of the campaign," said the spokesperson for the Trump campaign, who refused to give his name — Reuters.
Today's voter at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the media from Pittsburgh" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump visited West Virginia — a state in which he won by over 40 percentage points — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help a Western Virginia candidate to the Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who loses the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows the spirit of the struggle, maintaining hope of victory in Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format that took place on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The collapsing momentum shuttle is a totally sophisticated sport concept, but one in which players really believe, and most of all in competitions like these.
So what do they look like right now?
"They've been running at six points, and now they only lead four points, so I think we have a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, is running four points, while twelve more points are still to be reached.
The Americans, as Spieth says, however, feel the wind in sails and have worthy patterns to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each of them could boast three points of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
The screams for the whole throat as a sign of excitement grew louder during his round, covering the key putt and winning the match when he and Thomas won two holes in two hits.
His reflection on the earth, which gave them a victory with the result of 15, came to a similar cry — one that makes the American team understand that it is still in play.
"All you need to do is focus and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for all those players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undeniable Ryder Cup story.
The strange but charming couple of the European team won four out of four and was right.
"Moliwood" is the only couple on Saturday afternoon not including the Bogey, but also avoided the Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the Nine on Friday morning.
The way of the game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that you have to beat these players on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, which could seal the potential European team victory at Le Golf National.
It'd be best if they were playing different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to speak about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the early fourball hero when he was paired with Aleks Noren.
The Bogey and the doubled nine front digged the Spanish and the Swede into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday to help get out of the hole.
The fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how the strategy may change at one point.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and taken a significant lead on the last day, but the foursome session has also shown that the US team has been stuck in a fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with a result of 10-6 includes the conduct on the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 Saturday games with foursome with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — accepted a team, bringing two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods, increasing its current score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to preserve the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unintelligible American team in the morning format of a fourball, winning a series with a result of 3-1.
The United States faced greater resistance in the foursome format, winning two matches, but could not undo the losses.
To preserve the trophy, Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points from 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debut to score four points in a row, while along with Molinari (this band was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history, which won four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a great style, they beat the pampered Woods and the American debiutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic score of 5&4.
Woods, who was tired of two Saturday matches, occasionally showed a flash of genius, but lost 19 of 29 matches in fourball and foursome formats, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning's fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in foursome format to defeat the result of 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who had positions 1 and 3 respectively in the global ranking.
The European team, however, did not all follow the thought of this pleasant, cold day in a field set out to the south of Paris.
Three times Jordan Spieth's lead winner and Justin Thomas set a point of reference for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with the result of 2&1 on Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 result in foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history would the band do a four-point loss, starting with a single, although Furyka's team would only have had a draw to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, Sunday's counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says "stantly not" to unilateral disarmament without trust.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during a UN speech that the lack of sanctions only deepens the lack of confidence of North Korea in the United States and there is no way that this country will unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea took "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as nuclear and rocket tests, nuclear disassembly and non-proliferation.
"However, we do not see any specific response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no guarantee of our national security, and in such circumstances there is no one-sided disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's reluctance to the "stage" approach to de-uclerisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual action, his statement seemed to be significant because it did not reject unilateral de-uclarisation as it had been in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the President-in-Office of the United States and the leader of North Korea, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim Jong Un committed himself to working for the "Denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (1950-1995), but the United States delegation announced that Pjongyang had to give up nuclear weapons first.
D.C. also supported calls to mitigate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"United States insist on "denuclarisation first" and increase pressure through sanctions in order to achieve their objective in a compulsory manner, even opposed to signing a "declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can put us on our knees is that of people who act ignorantly towards us.
The problem, however, is that the lack of sanctions makes us less confident."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which was discussed at the beginning of the week by the United States leader at the UN.
Instead, the Minister noted three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months, and added: “If the deuclerisation party were South Korea and not the United States, then there was no such impasse for the deuclerisation of the Korean peninsula.”
Mim this, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different compared to last year, when he said at the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea missiles in the territory of the United States is inevitable after Mr Evil President Trump called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the UN Forum of Trump, which threatened North Korea's "total destruction" last year, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps to disarmament, but he also said that there was still a lot of work to be done and that until North Korea was deprived of nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not set a time interval for this, saying: “No matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongyang for the steps taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council that "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue and be continued until we find a full, final and verified deuclarisation".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea, trying to choke funding for the Pjongyang nuclear and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly Forum and later said that next month he would visit Pjongyang again in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit could not be called a success.
He left Pjongjang in July, saying that progress had been made, and in a few hours North Korea condemned him for "bang demanding".
North Korea has committed this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in, that it will disassemble the site of missile testing and nuclear complex if the United States takes the appropriate measures.
He said that Kim Jong Un told him that the "appropriate measures" he cared about were security guarantees that Trump had committed to in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on a long enough rest
The new Harvard course, which took place this year, has provided students with more sleep to combat the growing culture of macho, which is to learn from “all-night students driven by caffeine”.
Students from the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he thinks is the first of this type in the United States.
To create the course, he was inspired by the announcement of the effect of depriving sleep on science.
“ After the speech, a girl came to me and said: “Why is it only now that I’m in my last year of college?
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, it is explained to students how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sport and improve the general well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, Harvard Medical School professor and Chief Executive Officer of the University of Health, said that this course was decided to introduce after it was found that students suffered from a serious sleep shortage within the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes the picture of the room in the dormitory where students click coffee cups, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the effect of caffeine and light and how sleep shortage affects sports results, as well as how important it is to keep your sleep regularly.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleeplessness may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Map of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not lead to an immediate change in student behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know what the health effects of smoking is,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "all-night science" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students means an increasing problem of sleeplessness.
Providing a sufficient amount of good quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep shortages cause the brain to go into hunger mode, making the student constantly hungry," he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the entire campus.
The next step he believes is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a reminder alarm when to go to bed and when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronics screens and LED lighting which can spread the rhythm of the day and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes care of Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered again in the struggle to leave Livingston, when Dolly Menga had shot down the disassembled Steven Gerrard team, winning 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record their first victory from the 4-1 triumph recorded in February over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard in 18 matches for the second time, causing a difference of 8 points to the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' composition showing a lack of involvement did not seem to improve.
While the Rangers recorded a fall in sixth place, Livingston went third — right behind Hibernian with one goal lost.
The Rangers team may have further problems with the need to provide a wound to the head of the Calum Spence linear judge after he was hit by a object thrown out of the guest court.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which allowed Ayr to get ahead of the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, in turn, went with the same eleven-year-old Livingston, who took the Hearts team point last week, and was thrilled to see how his well-trained team tormented at every step of its opponents.
Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but it's Livingston who did more with the ball when they got her.
They should have scored in just two minutes, when Menga's first place of the ball allowed him to face Scott Pittman with Allan McGregor's gate, but the helper didn't take his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed a deep-to-the-out shot to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, who played the position of defender, could only remain in the rear position.
Rangers regained control in the third quadrant, but it looked like they had more hope than they believed in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had been involved in a penalty for fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless attacked each other, but Judge Steven Thomson developed a Colombian claim.
The Rangers were able to give only two customs shots in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox, Liam Kelly, barely concerned with Lassany Coulibaly's head and the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While the goal-opening goal won by Livingston in 34 minutes may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for themselves the effort put into its acquisition.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with a deep piece of the game that Jacobs made.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw a ball in Scott Robinson, who kept his peace, giving it to Menga for the purpose of simply finishing the action.
Gerrard did not waste his break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately had an impact on the wingman who threw the ball into Morelos, but impressive Kelly managed to block it from his position.
The Livingston team continued to drag guests into play exactly the way they like when Lithgow and Halkett performed long injections one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor had a good stand in front of Jacobs, and Lithgov pulled the game off the corner.
The Rangers reserve, Glenn Middleton, once again hoped for a penalty shot when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: Geiger meter inventor
And now the page of our issue "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882 — 136 years ago... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's numerator has become both an element of science and pop culture, for example, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which you experienced apparently unlikely cowboy-scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Now you hear something!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived until today.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" hostile cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise hostile cells during treatment.
This method consists of separating immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory.
At that time, they may "see" the protein common to many cancers. They are then re-injected into the body.
The vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one vaccine-treated woman, the immune system was diagnosed with a loss of ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate immune cells from the patient, change them into a laboratory, so that they can "see" protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject the patient of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very good. ”
HER2 “distributes the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to collecting immune cells from patients and to ‘teaching’ their tumour cells has worked to treat certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West is going to a pro-trumpian diatribe in Saturday Night Live with a MAG hat on her head.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was "exploited" in his studio during the Saturday Night Live program after he praised the president of the United States of Donald Trump and said he would apply for office in 2020.
After that night, he performed his third song called Ghost Town, during which he had a wearing hat with the inscription "Mike America Great", he conducted a lead against Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
"How much I talk to white people, I hear: "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
If I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star laughed at the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh made before the Senate judicial committee about the sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West was sent to the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock wanted to laugh at West by putting a post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems with his hat behind the scenes.
"They came at me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're on me!
And then they say I don't have a choice," said Washington Examiner.
The West continued: “Do you say that I have no choice?” adding: “I will put on a superman’s cape, so that you will not be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Let's accept."
The SNL team’s words twice called for “buking” the audience, and the members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, reports Variety, who was in the studio during these events:“ There was a grave silence in the studio. ”
West was invited to replace Ariana Grande's singer, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has intrigued many by making the I Love it in changing the bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the TPUS Conservative Head of Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "To one of the most brave: I thank you for having spoken to Mafia."
On Twitter, Karen Hunter said that West simply “was himself and this is absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I will NOT reward people (by buying her music or clothing or supporting her “art”), which, I think, accepts and spread harmful ideology to my community.
He's free.
We're free, too," she said.
Before the rapper program, he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he had already "formally named Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — following Diddy’s tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
The friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, accepted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed the name to the symbol, and then the artist known earlier as Prince.
A charge of attempted murder on knife stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
This event took place in Ballyhackamore, as the police say.
The defendant is due to stand trial in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the D.A.'s Office.
Star Games about the throne Kit Harington addresses the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval series "Game for Thrones".
A 31-year-old actor hit a stereotype of a macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys often think they have to play tough guys to be respected.
In his interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the game plan for the throne, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that she felt "enoughly confident" by addressing this issue.
“ Does it make me feel pretty secure at this point — where we made a mistake on the subject of masculinity? ” he said.
"What were we teaching men during their growth, looking from the perspective of the problem that we are currently dealing with?"
Kit believes that the development of toxic masculinity may be partly responsible for the presentation of very male figures.
He continued: “What attitudes are born, and what attitudes are taught?
What do you learn on TV and in the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to stand on a certain side in order to be a man?
I think that this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change it?
It's clearly not all right with young men."
In his interview, he also said that he would no longer play the prequel or the sequal of the Game of Throne after the series was completed in the following year, saying that he “went to battles and horses”.
From November, Kit will play the play of the "True West" by Sam Shepard, who is a story about the film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers getting to know his wife Rose to be the best thing that ever happened to him in the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the plan, which provided me with my future family and a new life," he said.
In this award award-winning Emma's fantasy show, Rose played Ygritte — an object of loving interests of the character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple were married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China has a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
There are over 820 000 people affected by this problem, as health workers of the country report.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, which means a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV is spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV was almost completely reduced, as the Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to one year to the other, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV by sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminating in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is widespread.
Given the country's conservative values, research estimates that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transfer are due to insufficient safeguards when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members revealed the Republican Party Senators — these are “hazardous lies” and “conspiracy theory”.
A member of the United States Chamber of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday as if a member of her team put the personal data of three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages of the above-mentioned legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party assured that these charges were filed by experts and websites linked to "ultra-right wings".
"The lies, lies, and even more evil lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
Public information was said to contain home addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and it was posted by an unknown person on the Capitol during a panel hearing in the Senate on charges of sexual offences against a nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after Kavanaugh's three senators questioned his candidacy.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was linked to the Waters office and published information on the Waters team member, as reported by Hill.
"This unfounded charge is completely false and it is a 100-percent lie", continued by Waters.
“The member of my team — whose identity, personal data, and security were compromised by these deceptive and false charges — was not responsible for leaking that information in any way.
This unfounded charge is completely false, and it's a hundred-percent lie."
Waters’ statement quickly caused criticism on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, the former White House spokesperson.
"This is the way of denial," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that it does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He can't provoke.
He must not question the motives of the person in charge.
For that, he must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticisation of the Democrats at the address of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of displaying excessive anger during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"A big case, if that's true," he wrote on Tweeter.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had notified "the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudous accusations".
"The complainants will be demasked and held liable for all their activities which pose a threat to any of my team members", she said.
Johnny English: Nokaut — spy parody with the weak Rowon Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new movie with the British theme has already become the norm. This seems to apply to a new part of the series of films from "Johnny English" that began in 2003 with the film "Johnny English" and which returned to cinema screens in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivated".
Will a self-conspiracy satire about how hopeless we are will become the new export goods of the country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has been granted a licence to party — his name and name more than anything else indicates that he is an extensive, comical product designed for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre tastes for smoothie glamour has a little of Inspector Clouseau, a splatter of Jasia Beani and a drop of this guy adding one note to the melody theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a global mystery — Atkinson once played in the forgotten TV commercials Barclaycard, in which he left chaos behind.
In the latest Johnny English series, there are one or two moments worth of attention.
I loved the scene where Johnny English was approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was rhythmically struck by the blades of the rotor.
On the screen you can clearly see the gift of Atkinson for physical comedy, but the sense of humor seems quite low and unnecessary, especially since currently also "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Imposible, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorist elements seem to be directed rather to children instead of adults — I think the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not as ingenious and consistent as the gags in the silent Atkinson films of Jasius Bean.
Ever since, the idea is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cybermaker penetrates the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British field operatives — to the terror of an agent in service, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a minor role.
This is the last drop in the bitterness of the Prime Minister, who is a pompous, wasted figure already suffering from a nervous breakdown due to the lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power, forming himself into Theresa May, but the scenario does not give her the opportunity to develop its wings.
Her intelligence consultants will inform her that she will have to return to the service of one of her retired agents to reveal the identity of all active spies.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English in his own person, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few pretty gags when teaching spying by English.
English is called to Whitehall for debriefing, reconnecting with its former Bough helper, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the commander of the submarine — a happy but somewhat tired figure played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin participate in the secret service of Her Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously dominated by a charismatic billionaire-techmaniac who claims to be able to solve the UK’s computer problems — Jason Volt’s villain, Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade made up of absurd situations: the waiters set the French restaurant on fire; they bring chaos into the deck of the luxury Volty yacht; and English sows desolation while using the kit for virtual reality to learn about the interior of the Volta house.
In the latter sequence, all restrictions disappear, but despite nice and loud performances, the whole film is very similar to children's television.
Typical average.
Like other Johnny English films, I couldn't resist thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
The work party denies the fact that it has drawn up a plan that provides for the British four-day working week for which they will receive a salary for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's work party will consider introducing a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week, receiving a five-day salary.
The party has reportedly wants company leaders to give savings to employees through a revolution related to the development of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an additional day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend with the same amount of pay.
Sources say that this idea "will fit" into the party's economic programme and plans to go out against workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way of benefiting workers from changing the economy.
The older member of the Labour Party, in a conversation with The Sunday Times, said: "The policy change is expected to be announced by the end of this year."
"This will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is something that fits into the party's approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support this idea — the Green Party has committed itself to introducing a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, these plans are currently not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: "The four-week working week is not party policy and its introduction is not considered."
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Office, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "directors without faces" and "speculants" in public utility companies.
The Chancellor's plans from the Shadow Office also mean that existing water companies may not recover their entire share, as the Labour Government could do "deductions" based on detected fraud.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees on company boards and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are answering in the 60-minute program to see if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their attitude.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and caused the question of whether the findings of the investigating office could have caused the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday's interview, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that might lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his fellow South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh in an interview.
I called him after it happened when the charge came in, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was strong, determined and unequivocal."
Graham's opinion, however, seems to be forged in stone.
"I made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it needed a strong charge to change it," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one of the people who serves could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's gonna change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival event, and has it contributed to any reduction in the level of poverty?
Global Citizen Festival will be held next Saturday in New York, an annual music event that can boast an extremely impressive composition of the stars and an equally impressive mission to eliminate poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of such stars as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the main goal of this event, which is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of Global Converty Project, an international group of activists to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless it was decided to purchase a VIP ticket), concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, making a phone call or other significant actions to help raise awareness of the objective of eliminating poverty.
But what success can Global Citizen boast over the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or is it another case called "clickivism", when people feel they're doing something important by signing a petition online or by placing an entry on Tweeter?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million "actions" of people supporting the action in order to achieve many different objectives.
It also claims that these actions have helped the world’s leaders to announce liabilities and laws worth more than 37 billion dollars to affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, which have already paid or financed at least 10 billion dollars.
The Group estimates that the hedged funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the British Partnership of Investors and Realists involved in "helping children to achieve their full potential", which promised Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in that country, after members of Global Citizen sent over 4700 tweets.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen members, such as You, we can make social injustice, which is malnutrition, history" — Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, during live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve mother and child nutrition, the government announced the funding of the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with dietary problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on your website, which was "How can you be sure that extreme poverty can be eliminated?"
Global citizen replied: “This will be a long and difficult way — sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But like the former great movements for civil rights and fighting apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars of this year's event in New York, whose hosts will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy for the "block" of Russian energy exports — Interior Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" flee to his Navy to prevent the influx of Russian energy into markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of Internal Affairs of the United States, Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government — is a pretext for the exploration of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the desire to facilitate energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this problem.
"The United States, by means of its Navy, has the opportunity to make sure that the sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants in the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a group of non-profits, which himself referred to as "the energy consumer's voice" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were in fact the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less about using and replacing fuels," he said, comparing Russia to "a pony who knows one trick" with a fossil fuel economy.
These statements were made at a time when Trump's administration continued its mission to increase the exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, which is much cheaper for European consumers than for Russian gas.
To this end, Trump’s administration officials, including the President of the United States of Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth $111 billion, which is intended to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to this project is due solely to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said the Russian Minister for Energy Alexander Novak, after meeting with United States Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September, Moscow.
The position of the United States generated a violent response from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation of Germany, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I believe that this is a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she would consider running for president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections she would consider running for president.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, and it also concerns a woman who holds the highest position,” said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidate for the presidency."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned the President of Donald Trump, saying that "he's leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren, without the garden, expressed her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, on Twitter, Warren wrote: "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most voters do not think that it should run for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voters from Massachusetts who chose the "probably" option said that the senator should not run as a result of a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidate, 38 percent of his potential candidate, and 48 percent opposed him.
Other known names from the democratic camp taken from attention to the potential candidate in 2020 were Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin talks about the Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD) of Track Palin during the election night of Donald Trump
Track Palin (26 years old) spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, which he must go through on his return, I understand other families who experience the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are getting back with," said Donald Trump's electoral audience in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son "the theme of the taboo," and then she said about her son and other war veterans: "They return a little changed, they return hardened, they return, wondering if they would show respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all other military members have given away their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, forcing him to give false statements in his report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon in the state of sober, as Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 Colombia States and District support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombia District are in favour of a legal challenge for the new U.S. policy that refuses to seek asylum for victims of gang or domestic violence.
On Friday, 18 states and district representatives made a letter in Washington, D.C., to support an asylum seeker who is struggling with this policy, as NBC News reports.
The full name of the cause in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union organization filed in August against federal politics, was not disclosed.
She said that her partner, "and his violent gang sons," was abusing her, but the U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors in favour of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new American asylum policy repealed the 2014 Board of Immmigration Applications decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum against domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Public Prosecutor General of Colombia, said in his Friday statement that the new policy "is ignoring state, federal and international law for decades".
“The federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such prohibition violates this principle” as stated in the list of amicus curiæ.
The prosecutors further argued in the letter that a policy refusing immigrants to enter is damaging to the United States economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and "as a necessary labour force".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear against racial, religious, nationalistic or socialism, or who have or have such political beliefs," said the Sessions in their statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Asyl was never intended to solve all the problems — even those serious — that people from all over the world face every day.
A desperate rescue attempt in Palu when the number of fatalities doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become more and more tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling", said Risa Kusum's 35-year-old mother, comforting her angry son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance brings the bodies.
"There's no clean water."
Residents were seen returning to the destroyed homes, searching water - stricken things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees, quickly overflowed.
Some wounded, including the Double Haris, who suffered a vertebral and arm fracture, rested outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
The tears filled his eyes as he talked about a violent earthquake that shattered the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save each other.
I think I've been pushed into the wall' – Haris said Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, and then her voice shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of being "caught" by propaganda advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page commercial ad in the U.S. newspaper, admiring the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, referred to China Daily's paid supplement at Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of trying to interfere with the United States Congress, which will take place on November 6, China is denying this charge.
The allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the United States elections confirmed what the U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in escalating a campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently leading to the escalation of the trade war that has led to the increase of tariffs on mutual imports.
The Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were intended to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republic of Trump Party, found Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa — the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in his Sunday edition, Des Moines Register, that “now the double force is beginning to be harassed by propaganda advertising in our own free press.”
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the respected American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, putting a paid commercial in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
However, in the kiosk on Beijing street there will be no opposition and no real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have on the worrying economic direction chosen by China, given that the media are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans are intimidating themselves before the mid-term elections of a woman with the right to vote by the Kavanaugh affair, warn analysts
While many leading Republicans support and defend the nominee of the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court in the face of several sexual assault charges, an analyst warns that you will meet during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent reaction, especially from women.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely large, and most Republicans already officially want to vote.
"This is not possible to undo," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse in Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts about whether Senator Jeff Flake (Arizon)'s efforts to conduct a recent FBI investigation would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it tomorrow and will not forget it until November”, said Karine Jean-Pierre, an older advisor and spokeswoman of the National Progressive MoveOn Group, published in Washington on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the "The November Coming" password, demonstrating in the Senate lobby that the Republicans were in control of the Court of Justice for not withdrawing Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, as Mic stated.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation goes beyond scale" said one of Stu Rothenberg's information sites, an impartial political analyst.
“People say it was already tall, and it is true.
But it may be higher, especially among the undecided women of the suburbs and younger voters aged 18-29 who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before a public statement by Ford, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault addressed to a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republicans decided to approve the nomination, this would be a violent response.
“A party of Republicans must deal with a small mess,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
"This is not just about voting the committee or voting the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have treated Ford," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, who helps in choosing Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided into who to believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with the latter being a little more supportive.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents strongly or more believed in Ford's testimony, whereas 35 percent claimed that Kavanaugh's testimony was definitely or more likely to believe.
In addition, 38% of the respondents claimed that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied while making statements, while only 30% claimed the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressures, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford's charges as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Sennac Court Committee that Kavanaugh had been assaulted by alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee to the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia at the time of her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web network, is launching a startup that is to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform, Solid, owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people have access to specific information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the goal of creating Inrupt was to "dominance over the world".
"We must do it now," he said, referring to startup.
"The historical moment has come."
The application uses Solid Platform technology to enable people to create their own "on-line store with personal data" or otherwise pod.
It may include contact lists, lists of things to do, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the online store with personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
This is what the company calls "personal data enhancement".
According to the president, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed in the project and a community of developers-volontarists.
As of this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that day-to-day will lead to upside down all their business models.
"I'm not asking for their permission."
On Saturday on the Media platform, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technology Institute.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been making a lot of contributions to the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely excited to think about the next epoch in the development of the network”, added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Honorary Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only clergyman of England, who was awarded the Cross of Victoria during World War I, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellengly and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he was awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday his two grandkids revealed a memorial stone at the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, said that the exposure of the stone precisely on the centenary of his grandfather's award was "excellently symbolic character".
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quantin Canal “in a very dense fog and under strong fire from field guns and machine weapons”.
He then hurried to the line of fire and, with the "most courage," led it forward, followed by a single attack on the position of the field departments, thus removing three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years old) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never be able to meet but at the same time humble.”
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, he made an end of the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support he receives from many people".
MMA fans don't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine if you hadn't slept all night to watch Bellator 206 gala pampered with your emotions and eventually couldn't see the main battle.
The San Jose gala program contained 13 fightings, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the British audience were shocked by the change of the program to the Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed when they didn't sleep until the early hours of the morning especially to see this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the conversion to cartoons for children as "a sick joke".
"In accordance with the Government Regulation, the content of this type is inadequate to be released at 6 a.m., which required a change to the programme for children", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication of Bellator organisations when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Pig, yeah."
The president of the Bellator organization, Scott Coker, said that they were working on a schedule to include the viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about the reinvention, I think we can fix it,” said Coker.
“But it is Sunday 6 in the morning, so we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we were covered in lots of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't just a legal issue.
I can promise you that this situation won't happen again.
We're going to limit the program to five fights instead of six to the standard amount, and we were going too hard to please our fans, and unfortunately, we're overdoing it.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worst" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic waterjump, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old said he didn't realize that they were all like him until he went to high school.
In Desert Island Discs, Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he was going to be a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual leader of this program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
When he appeared in the program for the first time led by Laverne, Daley said that growing up he felt "less valuable" from others because "the simultaneous love of boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
He said: “To this day it is a sense of less value and of being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed. ”
He said he wanted to prove that he was worth something, so that they wouldn't let everyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time brown Olympic medalist became a loud LGBT activist and used his performance at this year's Community of Nations Games in Australia to appeal to more countries with the decrimination of homosexuality.
He said that he had decided to express himself because he felt happy to live openly, without any implications, and so he wanted to give others hope.
A threefold world champion said that falling in love with a man — the American filmer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “surprised. ”
Daley got married to an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, pointing out that such a difference of age was never a problem for him.
“When you pass through so much at such a young age,” he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and the death of your father three years later, he said that it was difficult for him to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple stayed in June with the boy's parents named Robert Ray Black-Next. Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
"The most important thing for me last year was to win a gold medal," he said.
"And you know what? There are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 after his diagnosis of brain cancer at the age of 40.
Daley said that his father didn’t accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London — wanted to take place in the first place.
“I couldn’t tell him: “You won’t be with us to be in the front row, Dad”, he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing. Only when he stopped breathing and died, I realized that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley attended the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I knew this was what I dreamed of my whole life — jump into the water in front of a crowd of people in the Olympic Games — it was the best feeling of all possible,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud, a song by Heather Small — that accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympic Games, and that still makes him a goose.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 station every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
No Mickelson on the bench during the Saturday part of the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to work his way so she doesn't pull her heel.
Mickelson, who played for the twelfth time in a two-year event, was returned to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as has often been done in his case with the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend the day cheering up the team and working on improving his game in the hope of correcting the reason for its reference to the bench.
A 48-year-old who has never given the most simple hits, even at the peak of his career, is not very good at the tight field of Le Golf National, on which the wrong strikes are mercilessly punished by long rounds.
And if the field itself is not discouraging enough for Mickelson, he must face the precision of British Open — Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with Tommy Fleetwood’s debut to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans (with the loss of four points at the beginning of the 12 singles) start the game with the fun, the Mickelson game can turn out to be extremely crucial.
Fury expressed confidence in his player — perhaps he could not do anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, held me with his hand and said that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He's in a famous gallery and he's brought a lot to play his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was gonna play two games.
I thought there would be more, but that's what happened, and that's what we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career at Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories in his account, 20 victories and seven drawbacks. Furyk said his presence brought a lot to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, funny, and it’s good to have him in the team’s room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings his person much more than just a game."
Captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a high point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point-by-point advantage prior to the start of the single on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in the Valderrama field, where he and his fellow Vice Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the finish line was short of the hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄22.
“We could not forget that we had a great advantage in the Valderrama field; we also had a big advantage in the Brookline field where we lost, and in the Valderrama field we won only by hair,” Bjorn said, after winning the 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which led the 10-6 lead in the Le Golf National field.
Time will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow, you're giving it your best.
Get out there and do whatever it takes.
The end is only when the points appear on the board.
We have the goal of getting a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
From the beginning I said I was focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who the people on the other side are – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, thrilled by how his players managed in a difficult field, added: “I would not have done better.
But tomorrow is different.
Singles start tomorrow, and that's another question.
It's good to play with your partner when everything goes well, but when you're playing alone, it's your golf skills that are tested to the limits of your ability.
That's the message you have to give to the players, and it's tomorrow to give everything you need.
The partner also has to do his best."
As opposed to Bjorn, Jim Furik will expect his players to achieve better results on their own than when playing with his partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
He experienced great returns on the last day, being a member of the winning Brookline team, and then failed after the European team performed a miracle in the Medinah field.
"I remember every word", he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, warmed up to fight his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow, we are playing 12 important games — you would like to start playing at a fast pace, as happened in Brookline and Medinah fields.
If this drive goes one way, there's gonna be a lot of pressure at the middle games.
We set up our membership right and set up boys in a way that would allow us to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was responsible for carrying out counterattacks by facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as for Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team players in the leading half of the program.
"I chose this group of guys in this order, because I think he'll be fine during the whole game," Bjorn said about his single election.
New German warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into use in 2014 in order to replace an ageing warship from the Cold War, but this will not happen at least until next year due to faulty arrangements and rising at an intimidating rate of costs, as local media have given.
The commission for the use of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was moved to the first half of 2019, as reported by the newspaper Die Zeit, referring to the words of the military spokesperson.
The ship should be included in the Navy in 2014, but as a result of the post-supply problems, it was necessary to amend this ambitious project.
Four units of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the U.S. Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with powerful cannons, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, including reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — the exploitation of new frigates should be possible for up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that these modern warships, which are designed to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete at the start of the ministry, as Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the first pages of the newspapers last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media reported a number of key "software and equipment" that made the ship useless in the combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, which is half as much as the older Bremen frigate.
It also turned out that the ship is far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of the Navy carrying out future modernisations.
A 7000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is considered to be twice as heavy as ships of similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost of the whole project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it amounted to EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) while the initial cost amounted to EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of putting new frigates into service are particularly relevant in the light of recent warnings about the fact that the forces of the German marine fleet are shrinking.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, admitted that the sailors "end ships capable of use".
He also said that this problem over time increased as a result of the withdrawal from the operation of old units without the provision of replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
The new research carried out on the premises of the Scottish Highlands area aims to show how bats use the landscape when they get food.
The results of the research are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to focus future efforts to protect them.
Research conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will cover midgets and small, as well as brown bats with long ears and bats from the family of Red Nights in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be deployed in key locations around the estate to track the activity of bats.
NHS workers and volunteers will also carry out field tests using portable detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings is intended to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and how the individual species behave.
A habitat map and report will then be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Dewar, an NTS nature conservation adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other associated species.
Bats in Scotland and throughout Britain have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the principalities and habitat losses.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may also pose a threat, as well as fly gums and certain chemicals used in construction materials, or even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching catches.
They use the complex technology of echocolacization to search for worms and obstacles in their way.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out tests, checks on the head, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organization even founded the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the territory of the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says it's the perfect territory for bats.
"Threave has a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are many more unknowns about bats. The work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of controlling the presence of bats before joining maintenance work in the estates, as the inadvertent destruction of one head can kill up to 400 females and young people, which may lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected — killing, harassing or disturbing them, and destroying their base is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Maintenance Trust, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and in many species we do not even know how their populations are. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while his lawyers intend to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the charges against him as "fake news", saying that people "wanted to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue Der Spiegel, a German news magazine who has published these charges.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was charged with rape of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Friday's reports, Der Spiegel was supposed to pay $375,000 to keep quiet.
Ronaldo (33 years old), a few hours after the charges were made, in an instagram live message addressed to his 142 million followers described these reports as "fake news".
‘No, no, no, no, no.
Today's news is facte news," said the five-time winner of the gold ball.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's okay", added the footballer with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel in connection with the charges that they called "an unacceptable statement of suspicions in the area of privacy" — as Reuters states.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said that the footballer would claim compensation for "moral damages in the amount of the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged event was to take place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at Ronaldo and Mayorg's nightclub, they reportedly went to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped a woman anally — according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged accident and told her that in "99 percent is a good guy", which was visited by this "one percent".
According to the file, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it was done with mutual agreement.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and that the hospital had taken photographs of her injuries, but later she agreed to an extra-court settlement because she was "feared with retribution" and "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old says she wants to cancel her settlement now because she still can't forget about the alleged incident.
During the alleged assault, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros for it.
Rexit: United Kingdom "after all times regret" leaving car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would have been “fearing for all time” if, after leaving the European Union, it had lost its world leader status in car production, said the Minister of Business Greg Clark.
He added that "he was concerned" when a Toyota UK representative told the BBC in an interview that if the UK leaves the EU without agreement, the production at a Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily suspended.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of border delays in the event of non-agreement on the issue of Brexit could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think that if the UK leaves the European Union without agreement at the end of March, there will be a halt in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid to leave the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW is going to close its mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are, as the car manufacturers say, the risks of the supply chain if the Great Britain leaves the European Union without agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, where parts reach both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be obstacles at the border, which, according to industry, may lead to delays and shortages of parts.
As the company representative said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without delivery to its plant in Derbyshire, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said that the Chequers Theresa May plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement, which will not only allow us to enjoy the success of today, but will also allow us to make the right use of this situation," said the BBC Radio 4 in today's program.
"The statements not only of Toyota, but also of other producers show that we must be able to continue what was made up of a very efficient set of supply chains".
The Toyota Representation was unable to say how long the production would be stopped, but it warned that in the long run the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, which would lead to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the board of directors of the Unite trade union, said that the members of the union are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are to be wound up, they will never be restored.
The spokesperson said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, as the White House says.
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "lated for another week" due to the ongoing struggle for a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, as the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the possibility of interference between the Russians in the election, the link between the close colleagues of Trump and Russia and the potential difficulty of the President's justice.
Whether Trump will release the Deputy Attorney General, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot subject for months in Washington.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a wire to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports, as if he were to resign.
The meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not fire Rosenstein.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
The press secretary, Trumpa, Sarah Sanders, showed up at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may take place this week, and it may be moved another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'll be sure to tell the press."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
The program, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not caused by a reluctance to "ostent" television journalists, and she added: "I will not hide that they are "ostentacy".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is conducting more "questions and answers" than any other president before him," she said, adding, without giving any evidence, "We've been familiar with the numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, said Sanders, but “if journalists have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We try to do this regularly and we have done this very often over the last few weeks. Press conferences will give way to such sessions, during which we will be able to speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with host dignitaries.
Salt press conferences are rare.
This week in New York City, the president may have demonstrated why it is, acting too freely and sometimes strangely in front of gathered journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from the EU's countries employed in NHS Scotland in the face of worry about Brexit
The Minister of Health has sent a letter to workers from the countries of the European Union who have been employed in the Scottish health service to convey gratitude to them from the country and ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months until the UK leaves the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of examining applications for "settled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The UK’s exit negotiations from the European Union continued this summer, and appropriate decisions will be made this autumn.
The UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat once again how much I value the contribution of every member of staff, irrespective of their nationality.
Colleagues across and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing surgery as a result of head trauma
The fencing group Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, had an operation as a result of a head injury in a Saturday match with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended with a team failure with Tennessee with a result of 31-27, informed Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told journalists that the player suffered a trauma shortly before the end of the first half.
"He came to the side line, and then he fell to the ground," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed it on the nose and carried it out to carry out further tests.
The Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no details yet on the type/size of the injury", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when this injury occurred.
Abercrombie (student of the second year released from representing universities per year to train his skills) plays his first season in Tennessee State after transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the game ended, he had five grays, which gives him 18 peas all over the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher tax on the purchase of properties in the UK
In line with the new plans of foreign buyers' tories, higher tax fees will be charged for the purchase of properties in the UK. Thus, the funds obtained will be used to help homeless people.
This move is intended to eliminate the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate.
The tax increase will cover those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury provides that in this way it will receive up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that a higher tax fee will be charged to foreigners buying real estate in the UK and that the additional funds thus obtained will be used to help the homeless.
This move is being taken as an attempt to eliminate Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate with promises of cheaper apartments and increase the burden of more earners.
Higher tax fees will apply to individuals and non-taxable companies in the UK. Additional measures are intended to help the government fight homelessness.
The additional charge — calculated in addition to the current tax charge, including the two years ago higher rates for second homes and rental apartments — can be up to three percent.
The State expects this move to get even 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and making it difficult to buy a first home or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate and spend most of their time outside the country, many wealthy regions — and especially the capital — have become “city of spirits. ”
New rules enter just a few weeks after calling Boris Johnson to reduce the tax fees that would help young people buy the first house.
He accused large developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the land but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to abolish the limits of cheap housing in order to eliminate the "house scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of rents and the end of the "no reason" eviction.
It also wants to give local authorities greater powers in building new houses.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that as Prime Minister I would be involved in rebuilding the British dream of making every next generation a better life than the previous.
This also means repairing our shaky housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy real estate here as hard working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of own house has become very far away, and the humiliation associated with the need for bedtime on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to become a Scottish elector"
The coach of the Sunderland team, Jack Ross, says that his "most ambition" is to stay the elector of Scotland at some point.
This 40-year-old Scot is working hard to heal North-East, who is now third in League One with a three-point loss against the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after he introduced St Mirren back into the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player,
But I only managed to get to Staff B" - said Ross in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“As a child, I often watched the Scotland game with my father in Hampden, and it always attracted me.
Such an opportunity, however, will come only if I succeed as a coach of the club."
Among Ross' predecessors, Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio were among the coach of Sunderland.
The former coach, Alloa Athletic, claims that he does not feel intimidated, taking over the role of such great personalities at such a large club, rejecting previously the proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Currently, success will be measured for me if I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
In view of its structure and convenience, its place is undoubtedly there," he adds.
"This will not be easy, but I will probably feel that I have been successful here, only if I succeed."
Ross's coach career lasts for three years, and before that he was an assistant coach in Dumbarton and for 15 months he was part of the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Alloa to advance again after degraded to the third league, and in the next season he led the St Mirren team from the edge of the fall to the championship.
Jack Ross says he's feeling a lot more comfortable now than when he played Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"This was a real turning point," he recalls taking up the position of Coach Allo.
"I really believed that running a team would be a lot better for me than playing.
It sounds weird, because as a player, I did well, made good money, and achieved some tangible successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week, you have to go through different situations.
They still meet me in terms of stress and pressure on the coach's work, but I feel good about it.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing it, and I can say right now I feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life."

The summer heat wave caused a violent influx of customers to British pubs, but it had a hiccup in restaurant networks.
Studies showed that sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants they fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting company, who developed the data, says: “The constant heat and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Championships caused the results of July to be similar to June when the pub turnover increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the restaurant’s earnings fell even more.
The 1.8% decrease in sales recorded in restaurants in June increased even further.
The drinks offering pubs and bars have done well, and their sales growth has exceeded the decline recorded in restaurants.
Food - serving ponies also suffered during the heat, although not as much as the owners of the restaurants.
It looks like people were just thirsty.
Sales of drinks in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month and food fell by 3 percent."
“ These results have been included in the trend that we have seen since the end of April, ” says Paul Newman of the RSM company for the analysis of the entertainment and tourism industry.
The weather and large sporting or social events remain the most important factors affecting the size of consumption 'outside the house'.
The fact that restaurant networks experience difficult times, it is not surprising, although the decrease in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences if it takes into account continuous pressures on cost reduction.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favorable moment for owners of food and time restaurants to show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the necessary reassurance."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the development of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups with a total turnover of more than £9 billion. It has recognised industry standards.
One for five children has secret social media accounts that he's hiding from his parents
Studies have shown that one in five children — some only 11 — has secret accounts in social networks that they hide from parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 students of secondary schools showed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
These messages have increased the fear that sexual content is published on them
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account that showed parents
One in five children — some only 11 years old — is setting up accounts on social networks that they do not reveal to adults.
The survey of 20,000 students of secondary schools showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" accounts, which refers to Instagram, where you can share photos.
These messages have increased the fear that these accounts are used to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students have admitted that they have a well-known “main” account that shows their parents and also have private accounts.
One of the mothers who accidentally encountered the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter met a teenager who urged others to "be raped".
A study conducted in independent schools by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 run two profiles. Half of them are admitted to private accounts.
The president of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It is worrying that so many teenagers create their places on the Internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the "athletics' voice" at the Scottish Athletics board.
During the annual General Meeting of the head of the Scottish Athletics Eilidh Doyle, she was elected to the board as non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most titled Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described this as an excellent opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from her rich international experience she has gained in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a great deal of respect in the Scottish, British and World Athlete community, and we are confident that introducing it to the board will bring great benefits to the Scottish Athletics," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak to the sportsmen, and I hope to be able to really help manage sports in Scotland.”
An American who, among his four gold Olympic medals, has won at 200 and 400 metres at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and now regularly plays the BBC as an expert, cannot come as a result of a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said time would show me if I could get my efficiency back and to what extent.
It was a morbid work, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again, and I went back to training!
Thank you for all your support!"
Advertising of lactatings, which compares mothers to cows, raises extreme emotions on the Internet
The Lactators company has triggered a storm on the Internet by publishing an advertisement that compares mothers breast-feeding to milked cows.
To announce the placing on the market of "the world's first silent lacquer to wear under clothes", Elvie, its producer, published a mocking commercial in the form of a video that highlights the freedom it provides to mothers.
It presents four true mothers dancing in a sow-filled moat to a song where you hear the words "Yes, I do, but you don't see the tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not just my boobs."
Refren goes on like this: "Submit them, wash them out, feed them to the children, wash them out, wash them out, finish your masters."
The advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has caused great controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of which claim that it is inappropriate to joke from the " horror" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf, except that their children are taken away from them after a few days of birth" - one of the users wrote.
Elvie lactator can be worn unnoticed under the feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “This is obviously traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Sure, let's use cows to advertise mothers' lactators that can keep their children."
Someone else added: "This ad is completely alienated from reality."
In her opinion, she said that the song is “fun. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
I felt like a cow while I was pulling out the food.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I'm not looking for a second bottom in it.
It's a brilliant invention," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a funny advertising directed at mothers who pull food (often at work or at the toilet) and feel like a cow.
It is not intended to praise or criticise the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lacquers attached discreetly to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many women who feed feel like cows.
However, Elvie's lactator is completely quiet, there are no cables or pipes and you can wear it unnoticed under the bra to feed, which gives women the freedom to move, hold children on their hands, and even leave home while they are pulling food.
Ana Balarin, a partner and creative director at Mother said: “The Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a courageous and provocative premiere.
By combining women and dairy cows with each other, we wanted to show all the challenges of drawing food and presenting at the same time in a fun and coherent way an amazing sense of freedom that he provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's lactator got to the front of the papers.
During the London Fashion Week, during the Marty Jakubowski show, the mother of two children with this product appeared on the run.
Hundreds of immigrants have been secretly transferred to the tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children being detained is increasing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border does not change properly every month, partly because of the severe rhetoric and the rules introduced by President Trump's administration made it difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually also undocumented immigrants who are afraid of exposure to deportation if they report for the child.
Such a risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that fingerprints will be taken from potential sponsors and other adults living on the common farm, which will then be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, an senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had reported as sponsors for children left careless.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the people arrested were not previously listed.
“ Nearly 80 percent of people who are or live with sponsors in a single household live illegally in a country, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That is why we are constantly chasing them," Albence said.
The workers of the hostel say that, as part of their efforts to speed up the regulation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as was the case with previous standards.
There will be much to be done through videoconferencing, not personally to ask the immigration judge to legalise their status.
Those who do not qualify for release shall be deported immediately.
According to the shelter staff and the reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become to rest or become depressed, which in turn can lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempts to escape.
The defenders found that these problems were even more serious in the case of larger centres, such as Tornillo, where due to its size it was easier to ignore the signals that something bad was happening with the child.
They also added that the transfer of children to the tent camp without providing them with adequate time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends may increase the trauma with which many of them are already struggling.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupationary forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moual, also called for refugees from Syria to return home, even though there has been an eighth year of war in this country.
He said that the foreign forces of Syria were illegal, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "let us deal with them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally" said the Assembly.
Moualem claims that "the war on terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to "bring out his holy battle until the territory of Syria" from both terrorist groups and "all foreigners who are illegally staying on it".
There are currently approximately 2000 U.S. soldiers in Syria, who are mainly engaged in the training of Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad and counseling them.
In addition, more than 1000 French soldiers are still in a war destroyed country.
With regard to refugees, Moualus stated that the conditions were good enough for them to come back and accused “some Western countries” of “indulging unruly fear” that discourages them to return.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations for help in these returns," he said.
"They policy issues that should have a purely human dimension".
The United States and the European Union have warned that, until President Assad has concluded a political agreement with the opposition to the end of the war, Syria will not receive any help to rebuild.
The UN diplomats say that the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large Bastion of the rebels in Idlib has created the possibility to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a large attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia into a province where three million people live.
But Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "significant time frame" and hoped that the military action would be aimed at jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaida Front of the Levant People's Defence Front, who would be "eliminated".
The UN Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to launch the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the governing party and opposition to draw up a post-war constitution of Syria and to prepare for the elections.
In his opinion, he outlined the conditions for the Syrian government to take part in the committee, saying that the panel should limit itself "to verify the provisions of the current constitution" and warn against interference.
Why will Trump win the election again?
According to this logic, President Trump would have been elected for a second term in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers have hoped, his presidency would have been removed from office and scandal earlier.
This would certainly be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency."
So far, there's no sign of a viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the CNN channel’s ratings in prime have doubled and reached 1.05 million viewers and the MSNBC channel has almost tripled up to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in the hour of the highest ratings, which is an increase of 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC broadcast on the channel "The Rachel Maddow Show" achieved the highest results in cable television, attracting as many as 3.5 million viewers of evening news programs.
“People fly like moths into the fire — that’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, the main producer of the series ABC “Designed Explovor” about the office secretary who becomes president after the attack on the capital.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
It mentions how she drove a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
“Why?" she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied.
"Chaos has entertainment value."
Of course, reports from Washington could, like anything else shown on television, consider the future of Roe v. Wade, the admissibility of family reunification or the state of the world economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being a well-informed citizen when you see a six-hour panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of secret informants in writing the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's jacket from ostrich skin for $15,000 (with proud clothing), as The Washington Post described, or about the implications of the shocking descriptions of President Trump's anatoms revealed by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario like I used to.
"What he is doing is partly like a reality show in that he provides new content every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about a changing staff and daily spins show Trump (like attacking the NFL league players or praise Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to miss the episode because you're gonna be a little behind.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of the island of Kauai, where she had her house, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing in front of the Senate Court Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was weighed.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people used to say 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

The flow of money from outside to the election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that, after the reorganization of the constituency, as a result of which two currently in office Congressmen stand in the race, the 17th constituency in Pennsylvania is the cash river.
This recently formed suburban district of Pittsburgh represents in Congress a representative of the Democrats, Conor Lamb, who obtained his seat in another district during the special elections of last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus representing now District 12 in Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new district 17.
The district maps were corrected after the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, which ruled that the old districts were unfairly appointed, giving advantage to the Republicans and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new district 17 began with the fight for the financing of the campaign between the main funding bodies of the parties — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning the hair in widely commented elections to the 18th constituency held in March.
The Republican has been in this position for more than a decade, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this district.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States was considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but they withdrew from this idea.
The diplomats have noticed that the Dominicans and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite the slight opposition of Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until the partners of the Trump Organization's management team had a hotel in Panama.
The officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to stop recognition of Taiwan” as the spokesperson of the department, Heather Nauert, said in her statement this month.
However, the sanctions were to be considered only on El Salvador, which, according to 2017, received 140 million dollars of aid from the United States, including the fight against drugs and support for development and the economy.
The sanctions proposed to limit financial assistance and the granting of visas to certain persons would be very severe for that Central American country, which faces high unemployment and high murder rates.
Following the progress of international meetings, the northern and central American officials postponed a high-level conference to address security and economic well-being in order to address the conclusions of a similar convention from last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
In mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus cutting all the reflections on sanctions against El Salvador.
The diplomats say that now at a conference which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is to appear, which is to be a sign of an invitation to the assembly of representatives of the administration.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new strong messages or penalties from Washington.
spokesperson John Bolton, on behalf of the White House, refused to comment on the details of the debate which were presented by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the subject of anonymity.
Their relations have been confirmed by an external analyst from the administration's surroundings, who has also spoken anonymously.

Another element may be the Special Prosecutor's report, Robert Mueller, on the possible obstacle to justice by President Trump, as evidence is currently available to the public.
According to the reports, there is also a question in Robert Mueller's investigation whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with the Russian attack on the American election.
If Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him during his preparations for re-occupation before the voters, and he may even be tried before the jury.
There are many who are unaware, and I do not want to suggest that Trump’s fall — or those in equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will decide how much longer this can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if only the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed, and we lost the possibility of avoiding the years of the slaughter that followed.
History railways turn around such turning points, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable legacy of democracy.
There's a few turning points in front of the Americans right now.
What are we gonna do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future investigation of Robert Mueller depends?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that he proposed last year's secret video of the president and speculated that he was not fit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the account presented by The Times is inconclusive.
“How do we react if the FBI’s newly commissioned investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed Judge of the Supreme Court, despite credible sexual assault charges and false testimony?
And, above all, will we, in the middle of the presidential term, choose people who will hold Donald Trump responsible to Congress?
If we don't get through these trials, it's gonna be a tough time for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed because of the lessons I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew. She was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over my ambassador residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the shabass candles on that table marked with a swastika.
Having such an inheritance, how could I not look optimistic in the future?"

Rangers Club player Graham Dorrans, with optimism, awaits a match with Rapid Vienna
Rangers take over Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the awareness that the victory with Austrians, obtained after the impressive remission from Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying from the G League of Europe.
Until remission 2:2 from Villareal the knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result will work on Rangers as a trampoline to a greater success.
"We did it well because Villarreal is in good shape," said 31-year-old.
“ We went to this game with faith that we would achieve something, and we fought the point.
At the end of the day, we might have pushed them back, but generally the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but in the second, we were better.
As for Thursday, this is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we can get three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent won a good score in his last game, but I'm sure we'll get through this and we'll have a positive score.
The last year has been definitely hard because of everything I've done with my injury and the changes in the club itself, but now we're all feeling good at our places.
The team's great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Fear of saving retirement spends women's sleep from their eyes
Even though the surveyers knew exactly how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked about it with their family.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants stated that she had talked to her spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide, who sells life insurance.
Where do you start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of yourself unless you have said your will before.
With your advisor and family, discuss where and how you want to take care of you, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask for help from a financial advisor: He can help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional care policy, a hybrid policy that allows you to pay cash to cover such expenses, or from your own property, if you have one.
Get your legal papers ready to prevent this from happening in court.
Select a trusted health officer to oversee it and ensure that the right persons act according to your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also the employment of an attorney who will handle the finances.
Choose a trusted person because she will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all accounts are paid if you can't do it yourself.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical attention and is going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Take all the information you need to have it ready.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who doctors are," Martin says.
“What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth having a plan like this."
Male fired from windmills in Ilfracombe
A man was shot repeatedly from a windmill when he came home from an evening party.
A 40-year-old boy was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, belly and arm.
The police identified the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST time as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not threaten the lives of a man.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami that visited the city of Palu on Friday.
Due to the severed communication to the rescuers, no information from Donggala cabupaten, which is located north of Palu, was obtained from an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
After the Pal disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some of the most important information about Palu and Donggala cabopatenia on Celebes Island:
The Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island. According to estimates, 379 800 people lived in 2017.
When the earthquake and the tsunami took place, the city was now celebrating the 40th anniversary of its founding.
Donggala is a kabupaten (administrative unit below the province) extending along the northwest coast of the island over 300 km.
It is estimated that 299 200 people lived in 2017.
The main branches of the Middle Celebes economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed in particular on the coast of Cabupatena Donggal.
Another source of income is nickel mines, but they are mainly in Morali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to information from Indonesia’s Catastrof Impact Control Agency over the last 100 years, earthquakes have invaded Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, the tsunami, which hit Donggala, killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
Nine people were killed in 1996 as a result of the tsunami in West Donggala.
Indonesia is located on an active Pacific fire ring, making earthquakes occur quite regularly.
The largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake that visited the western coast of Aceh in the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226 000 people in the Indian Ocean, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: By the end of March and early April, Sumatra visited a series of strong earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, there was an earthquake of 6,8 degrees, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: In the vicinity of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra, there was an earthquake of 7.6 degrees.
More than 1,100 people died as a result.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands near the Sumatra coast. It caused a tsunami wave of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's kabupaten in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the destruction that caused the earthquake and the tsunami of 2004.
This time, the tsunami wave wasn't formed, but more than 100 people were killed by the building.
2018: Large earthquakes have visited Indonesia’s tourist island, Lombok, killing over 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of homes and brought temporary troubles for thousands of tourists.
Old son of Sara Palin arrested under domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the vice president of Sara Palin, was arrested on the charge of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, from Wasilla, Alaska, 29-year-old, he was arrested with domestic violence, made it difficult to file an application and to resist arrest.
According to a police report, when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to file a report of a crime, he took her phone.
The KTU station reports that Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and has a guarantee of $500.
According to her information last Saturday, he was in court, where in his defense speech he said he was "probably innocent."
There are three class A offences in the palina, which means he can receive even a year's sentence and $250,000 fines.
He was also charged with a class B offense, for which he is threatening to punish a day of prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time that Palin's criminal charges are being filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an attack.
The case is now pending before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, made it difficult to file an application and to hold arms in a state that was sober as a result of this incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, a group of veterans criticised Sara Palin, who tied the aggressive behaviour of her son to a post-traumatic stress syndrome, which he received during his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died as a result of a tsunami after an earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a Friday earthquake that visited the island of Celebes in Indonesia.
Earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of Celebes, which is located on the northeast of the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Social media has videos showing the moment of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held, there were hundreds of people.
Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for a terrorist suspect in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding death penalty for Sayfulll Saipov, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, resulting in eight people being killed, and this is a rare punishment — it has not been executed in this state for federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack in October on a bicycle path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, Saipov allegedly used the rental truck Home Depot, which was run by pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to the notification made in the southern district of New York, the intention of demanding the death penalty in order to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "targetly" killed eight victims and "targetly" caused serious injury to the body.
According to the court's file, the death penalty is at risk for both charges.
A few weeks after the federal attack, Saipov presented an indictment of 22 positions, including eight counts of murder for illegal activity, which is usually the procedure used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and the charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solidar planning and reflection." The way Saipov carried it out it was referred to as "terrible, cruel, and immoral".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has brought harm, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlija, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoz and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,” states the proposal.
Five of the victims were Argentinian citizens who lived in New York City.
For the last time, ten years ago, the death penalty in the South New York District was filed.
The accused Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but he finally heard life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty following the federal case was last executed in New York City in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Marriage was executed after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's judicial records, which came from Uzbekistan, there were no guilty consciences within months of the attack.
The police say he told the investigator that he was comfortable with what he did.
According to the Saipov prosecution, he told the authorities that he was inspired by ISIS films he was watching on the phone.
According to the police, he also claimed to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
The indictment file, which includes 22 counts, says he's innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders who represent Saipov, said that they are "for obvious reasons disappointed" by the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and rejection of life without the possibility of early release after admission to guilt will extend only the suffering that these events have brought to all those concerned," he said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the D.A. not to demand the death penalty.
The parliamentary on the tories says that NIGEL FAAGE should be held responsible for the negotiations on Brexit
During today's protest during the Tories Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former leader of the UK's Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must "feel hot" from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's parliamentarians suggested that he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a Conservative member, told the protestors in Birmingham that if Farage were a Secretary of the Republic of Brexit, "The United Kingdom would be outside the Union".
However, the addition of the Tories for staying in the community to a separate protest against Rexit, which took place in the city, further highlighted the burden of reconciling the deep-divided ranks facing Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement his plan of compromise with the Chequers among the attacks by the supporters of Brexit, its opponents, and the European Union itself.
Despite its opposition, its allies argue that it will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and force the Eurosceptics and the Labourists to make a choice between its proposal and its "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull that he wanted to "throw the plan out of Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be the agent responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had dealt with it, we would have been outside the Union now," he said.
The member of Wellingborough added: "I support Rexit, but we have to throw the plan out of Chequers."
In his opposition to the European Union, he said: “This is not why we have fought in world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want to be our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that the citizens had changed their mind from voting in 2016: "The British thought that they had changed their minds and wanted to stay in the Union was completely false".
There was also a supporter at the demonstration, Brexit Andrea Jenkyns, from a party of tories that told reporters: “I am just saying, Prime Minister, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy the support of the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, either our party or our activists, who make the streets and who chose us, nor do they support it.
Leave the plan with the Chequers and start listening."
In her statement to Prime Minister May, she added: "The measurements keep their positions when they keep their promises".
Nigel Farage stated that the politicians involved in the demonstration must “feel hot” if they were to betray the 2016 referendum decision.
“Now this is a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Rexit, and we're here today to tell 'em we won't let you do it."
He added: “I want you to make politicians who are at the edge of the betrayal of Brexit feel warm.
"We are mobilizing the army of this country's people, who have given us victory in the referendum on Rex, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
During that time, the anti-Bexitus marched through the city to the center, where there was a two-hour demonstration.
A handful of activists waved the banners "Torysi v.Brexit" after the group was formed this weekend.
The activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, laughed out conservatives for the security issues of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
“These are people who claim to be able to organise IT systems and all technology for supporting the Canada plus plus plan, liquid border, free trade with no borders with Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Rexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "seriously consider" a presidential candidate
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, "he will seriously consider running for president."
According to The Boston Globe, a Democrat representative from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting with voters held in the Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes Donald Trump, will apply for re-electation in November, and will be her opponent to represent the Republicans, Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that Warren can defeat Trump in the 2020 elections.
The Saturday event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for “the women to go to Washington to fix our broken government — and she also means the woman at the top.”
Arresting the perpetrator of a deadly shooting in which the LSU team player, Wayde Sims, died
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana reported a suspect's arrest on Saturday in a Friday shooting that killed a basketball player from the LSU team, Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of a 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at a conference held at 11 p.m.
On Friday, the video of the shooting was released, asking for help in identifying the man on it.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims died of a shooting near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot with a firearm to the head, which resulted in his death," said Police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to 247sports.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the crime scene, carrying a gun and shooting at Wayde.
After his arrest, during which he did not resist, he was transferred to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 198 m junior Wayde Sims was raised in Baton Rouge. He played 32 matches in the last season, starting 10 times, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the floor, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 matches.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the world title after the team's command allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would have a significant impact on the outcome of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went down to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to go in the tail of the pellet, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes player went down to the box in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after the wheel action, which led the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the inner part of the track, risking the push to the defensive after the double movement of the rival to defend the position on the third corner, Hamilton proceeded to lead.
Max Verstappen took off at the end of the bet and at his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap he was in seventh place.
He then led through a large part of the race because he did not change tires in order to complete the fast finish and pick up Kimi Raikkonen fourth position.
Finally, he came down to the service point on the 44th lap, but in the remaining eight laps he was no longer able to accelerate.
“It was a tough day, because all weekend Valtteri was doing a great job and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me through.
The whole team gave its best to take two first places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body speech.
During the meeting, which was held on Saturday, President Donald Trump tipped off Senator Diana Feinstein, who claimed that she did not disclose the contents of the letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused the nominee of being a judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the statements made by Christina Ford before the Senate's Commission on Justice, but instead stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad, mean and lying".
“What may have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have witnessed for a few days, when we see anger when we see people angry, mean, mean, mean, mean, mean, and lying,” he said.
"We see what was published and revealed, and then they tell us 'oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it to her."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we did not reveal" - he added, precipitating the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and leaked the contents at the beginning of September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's innuendo, I didn't reveal her story," she testified Feinstein to the committee, as The Hill reports.
"She asked me for discretion and I did not disclose these content according to her request."
However, her statement did not convince the president who commented on it during the Saturday meeting: “I tell you, it was a really bad body speech.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst language I've ever seen in her life."
Pursuing the defence of a candidate for a Supreme Court judge, whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats are using insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take all measures.
You can see meanness, malice, they don't care who they're hurting, who they have to destroy in order to take over and control," said the president, according to Mediaite's reports.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match with Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants team.
The Dundee Stars Club retaliated its five-year-old Elite League loss with the Belfast Giants team, winning a five-to-three retaliatory match on Saturday.
The giants quickly gained a two-breasted advantage after the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie evened the score, and then Dwyer reinstated the Giants to lead.
Francois Bouchard rebalanced the score, winning a goal for the Dundee team, and then two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's carers, who, despite their initial loss on Friday night, won the Dundee team in Belfast 2:1.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season — the first three matches were won by the giants.
The Dwyer's opening goal fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaull's aide. Four minutes later Beauvillelier doubled the score due to David Rutherford's aide.
After an intense opening at 13:10 a.m. Sullivan introduced the host team back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt evened the score at 15:16.
Dwyer provided an advantage of the giants before the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first round.
The host team has been regrouped and Bouchard has rebalanced the score of the goal gained during the game in front of 27:37 minutes.
At the end of the second round, the Cownies and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen provide the first win for the match. The final win of Dundee was sealed in the middle of the last third by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The giants, who lost four for their last five games, will play the next game at Milton Keynes' place on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies helping hundreds of people on the plane escape from earthquakes
The Indonesia air traffic controller was called a hero after he died, helping a plane with hundreds of people on board safely.
More than 800 people were killed, and many were considered missing after a major earthquake that hit Celebes on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong secondary shocks in the area. In Palu, many people have been trapped in the rubble.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a disintegrated flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to ensure that the airline Batik Air (lot number 6321), which was on the runway, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to reports from the Australian station ABC News spokesperson of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, he said that the controller's decision probably saved hundreds of lives.
We organized a helicopter from Balipapan city to Borneo to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"This message tore our hearts" - he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of fatalities can reach thousands. The National Agency for Disaster Management reports that the possibility of accessing Donggala, Simi and Boutong cities is limited.
"We believe that the harvest of death continues to grow, because many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached," said the spokesperson of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A six - foot - long tsunami wave destroyed Palu, where on Sunday the victims' mass funeral will take place.
Military and civilian planes provide help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News station: “The ambulances are constantly bringing the bodies.
He's running out of drinking water.
Small shops are pampered."
John Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to rescue, but we do not know what will be left behind.
It's already a tragedy, and it could get worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widododo, came to the army, saying: “I am asking you all to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
This year Indonesia was visited by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
A plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini reports that one person is missing after the plane crashed on the lagoon
Airline operating a flight that crashed on a lagoon in the Pacific States, informs one person that he was missing, and previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a drowning plane.
Air Niugini reported that, according to the data on Saturday afternoon, they couldn't count one man who was travelling on a fair plane.
They ensured that together with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators are trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details regarding the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Airport, the other passengers and crew members were helping the local boats.
Officials informed on Friday that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline said that there were still six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all stable.
It is not clear what caused the disaster, nor is it aware of its exact course.
Airline and the United States Navy claim that the plane landed on the lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he's out of the belt.
American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was very low.
"This has helped us a lot," he said.
Jaynes said he managed and others to get through the belt water to get out of the emergency melting plane.
According to him, the cabin crew were panicking and screaming, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that in rescue operations they also helped sailors who were working on the modernization of the coast, and they managed to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have died in the last two decades in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea. However, Air Niugini is not among these lines.
The analyst restored the events of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. finished presenting evidence in the retrial of the man accused of burning a live woman in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for many hours as a court-appointed intelligence analyst.
He described to the judges how he replayed the route of a 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
As the Clarion Ledger reports, Rowlett said that he had obtained location data from various mobile phones that showed that Telis was from Chambers on his own evening.
When the data confirmed that, at a time when Quinton was supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was near Jessica Chambers, the police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said that he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another misconception is Tellis' claim that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact details as well as text messages and connections from her phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The final defense speech is scheduled for Sunday.
The judge said the case would probably be handed over to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed — What Is Aware of Hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wishes to change the negative image of the species by filling its music with a positive message.
According to the High Breed Group from Bristol, today's hip-hop left behind its original political content and social issues.
The team members want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of the conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the creation of artists like Akala and Lowkey, the rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Commons has recently been observed in the UK.
Another black one?!
Nanny from New York suing a couple for release after the "racist" text message
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for getting her fired from work against racist background after receiving a misdirected text message in which the mother of the child complains that she is "another black person".
The couple deny that they were racists, comparing the lawsuits to "hantage."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly established when it turned out that the new sitter, Giselle Maurice, who became the first day at work in 2016, was black.
"NEEE, THE COLE OF THE WHITE PERSON," she wrote to her husband in her text message.
But instead of sending him to him, she accidentally sent him to Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post reports, when Plasco-Flaxman realized that she was guilty of the gaff, the "lost" fired Gisella Maurice, claiming that she was a loving nanny who was African-American, was doing her job badly, and she was also expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice received her work day payment, and then she was sent home to Uberem.
Now she's demanding a couple of damages for a 350-dollar exemption, multiplied by six months, for which she was originally employed with housing, although she didn't sign the contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do such a thing" - said the Post newspaper on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination".
The couple resisted the accusations of racism, claiming that it was justified to end Mrs. Maurice's cooperation, because after they insulted her, they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she wasn’t going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists" – said Joel Plasco, Post's husband.
“ Would you trust your children to a person you have made an accident, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
Compared the lawsuit to "hantage," Plasco said that his wife had only two months earlier and was in "very difficult situation".
"Do you intend to blow something like that?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case in court is not yet over, the public has quickly delivered a few judgments in social media, criticising her for her behaviour and thinking.
The new letter reveals that the book publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers wouldn't feel a connection to the talking mission.
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm adoption of the book, says: “It is hard to stand up for the first time before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He claims that her father, who, before a small plush bear inspired him to write a children's book, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was confident that his work would be rejected.
The Paddington, who he describes as “a very important member of our family, ” says her father was proud of his success in secret.
"He was a quiet man, did not brag" – he adds.
“However, since Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something — you feel proud of him, although it is not your merit.
I think that the success of Paddington was seen in that way.
Although he invented and created it himself, he always deserved Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
After her daughter landed, she was transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad called regularly and said it was really bad that he probably wouldn't make it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called to say Natasha dies in two minutes, and I have to say good-bye to her.
I did anyway.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be at your place.
The medicines that her doctors gave her to maintain the heart’s action slowly stopped working and were eliminated from the body.
She died a while earlier, and it was the end of everything.
All I could do was sit around and wait to see that it was all going on.
I couldn't writhe or scream or cry because I was among other people.
I had to stick to it."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who was already weeping for the loss of her daughter, entered board with other passengers, unaware of the torture she had been through.
"No one knew," she said.
I had my head down and my tears floated all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an omnipotent compassion for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Posts from women in mourning to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women, whose loved ones have committed suicide, are trying to dissuade others from their intention to take their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can get help with.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he got depressed, took his own life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," he says.
A 45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, tells us that her son was a very promising cook about an infectious smile.
“They all knew his smile.
They always said he could lighten up every room."
But before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a really black place".
In 2014, Brother Tyler was 11 years old, and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of dominac effect."
Sharon Davis created cards “to tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't stay silent - talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother died, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
"He didn't say anything about feeling down, sad or anything" he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was already in a pit on Christmas, and when the kids opened his presents, he even looked at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “This pulls out a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in Italian because the FBI is in the middle of an investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get what he was asking for - limited time and scope - perhaps we could achieve some unanimity" - said Jeff Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "fall off" in the opposite camps, leading to impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
All their reluctance comes from a moment.
The election to Congress is in a few weeks — November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans will lose it, the chances of choosing a certain person to the highest court in the country will significantly decrease.
George W. Bush had already picked up his phone to call the senators and get them to back Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House, and by him met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
A vote will take place in the Senate of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain that Brett Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 senators, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break through the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's rule, the number of refugees from North Korea is decreasing.
According to the South Korean legislator since seven years ago, Kim Jong Un took power, the number of people fleeing from North Korea has fallen to South Korea.
In a quote from the Ministry of Union of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug said that 1127 escaped last year, and in 2011 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more accurate controls at the border between North Korea and China, and higher rates charged by human traffickers.
Pjongjang did not make a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are ultimately proposed for South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 Koreans from the North have illegally crossed the border since the end of the 1953 Korean war.
Most of them are fleeing China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which makes it easier to cross it than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to their country by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still at war, have significantly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongyang, where they had talks about the negotiations on denuclerisation that had previously come to a dead end.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, which took place in Singapore in June. The fruit of this meeting is a general agreement to clear the Korean Peninsula with nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of lack of progress on this issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security and, in these circumstances, there is no possibility of unilaterally disarming ourselves first," Ri said in his speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histery" and claims he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, a "histeric" and said that by nature he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave these words during an interview that she gave during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday.
"I think that if a woman acted like this, she would be considered a 'history'," said Pelosi about his reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh had made on Thursday before the Justice Senate Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his preliminary speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — almost screaming and losing his speech when he discussed family issues and high school years.
He also banished the Democrats from the committee, specifying the charges of a "grotesque and coordinated attack on the reputation" organised by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudice to the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Asked if she would seek the withdrawal of Kavanaugh from office if he had received his nomination and if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also be in office in that court where he currently works," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in a district appeal court in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she fears the possible Kavanaugh rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the clash of Kavanaugh, he avoided asking if he would cancel some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to introduce a prejudiced person into a hysterical court, who expects us to say 'but it is wonderful', added Pelosi.
And women have to own it.
It's a proper diatribe, months and years of fury, and she can't throw it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry" - she told me Gloria Stein 45 years later.
"That's quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was a manager at a company helped me so much, and she said that she also cried when she was angry, but she made up a way to make her cry and she starts crying, and she talks to the person she talks to, ‘You probably think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry.
And he's still doing his thing.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a part of the loss of anger because they are in principle mistakenly understood.
One of my obvious memories of one of the first jobs in a man - dominated office is how I began to cry out of inexcusable rage. A woman — a cold manager I was always a little afraid of — then grabbed my neck and led me to a stairwell.
"Don't ever let them see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy to take care of you."
Patricia Schroeder from the Democratic Party, who was then sent to the Congress of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, frustrated to Patricia's borders, she realized that she might actually consider the idea of running for the president.
"It was not a thought-out decision," she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"The election had already become seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone described the situation as the "King Snow" and the seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder was a little behind in fundraising and promised herself she wouldn't start a race if she didn't collect $2 million.
It was a defeat battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave a thousand dollars to men, had only 250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts? ” she wondered.
During her speech, in which she announced that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so full of emotion — gratitude for those who supported her, frustration because of a system that made it so difficult to raise money and turn to voters, not delegates, and anger at sexism — that her voice was stuck in her throat.
"You might think I've had a nervous breakdown," she recalls the press response.
"You might think I'm being sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"Did she cry?"
What benefits can Beijing’s economic war between the United States and China
The halls that began the US-China economic war were deafening, and although the battle is still ongoing, the conflict between these countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term,” says experts.
The first warning was launched this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on key exports of China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week following the introduction of a new tariff rate of 200 billion dollars (150 billion) for goods, which resulted in the taxation of half of all goods arriving in the USA from China.
Every time Beijing was in nature, it recently increased duties on American goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every U.S. impact and it does not appear that the second economy in the world is about to cease.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting demands, but a public slope of the head before the United States would be too embarrassing for the President of China, Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing plays out well, the pressure from the US trade war could strengthen China in the long term, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the economic chaos of one of the countries is in fact far more dangerous than the observers have previously given," said Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher at the think tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is "ready" to return refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding a country that has been destroyed as a result of more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moual, stated that the country's conditions were improving.
"The situation on our territory is now more stable and secure, thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
To restore normality, the government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists all the time.
All conditions have already been fulfilled for refugees who have to leave the country because of terrorism and unilaterally move their daily lives and means of living to return voluntarily to it.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million citizens have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moual said that the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept the aid provided or offered by the countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe seales the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the US team with the result of 16,5 to 10,5 on the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
On the European country, the United States has already lost six times in a row, and since 1993, Ryder Cup has not won the European Cup.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the leadership of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it reached 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who, most of the tournament failed too well, was hit by a ball from the base straight to the water at the 16th hole of PAR3, thus giving the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was shiny through all rounds and became one of four players, who since 1979, when this tournament took place for the first time in the current format, managed to score 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by 5&4 by the lowest ranking player from Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the highest place in the world ranking, lost two holes before the last match with English Ian Poulter, for which it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The European winner of Ryder Cup became Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who already took part in eight such tournaments and won a 25,5 career point.
“Do not cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas that he believed in me and chose me.
I'm very happy to get the cup back.
This is the success of the whole team and I am pleased to be able to help," said moved Garcia after winning the team from Europe.
He's passing a stick to his native John Rahm, who beat a single American golf legend, Tiger Woods, by 2&1 on Sunday.
"I feel amazing pride in winning Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play," Rahm said.
Woods lost all the games in France and now has the 13-21-3 scores at Ryder Cup.
This is unusual statistics, for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 most important titles and has resigned only to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team has had trouble finding a treadmill all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his American captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I am proud of the boys, I fought.
At some point this morning, we pressed some Europeans.
We're backing out.
Hats from the heads of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will change the group. Together with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup, we will find a way to move forward.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for your opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
Flowering information — in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasote reduces the density of plankton
The latest report by Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in plankton densification in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, the presence of a ostrich flower has been reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, suggesting that its density is decreasing.
It extends from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee.
The results can be found approximately 16 kilometres from the coast of Hillsborough, but in a smaller number of places compared to the previous week.
The bloom was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, average plankton concentrations were recorded off the coast and in the waters of Pinellas County, low to medium by the coasts of Hillsborough, natural to high in Manatee County, natural to high coasts and in the waters of Sarasota County, natural to medium in Charlotte County, natural to high coasts and in the waters of Lee County and low in Collier County.
In the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, there are still cases of respiratory irritation.
Last week, however, they were not reported in northwest Florida.
