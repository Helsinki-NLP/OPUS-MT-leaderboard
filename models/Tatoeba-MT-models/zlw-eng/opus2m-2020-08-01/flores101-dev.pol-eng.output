"Installing monitoring in a determined way would show animal workers that their welfare is the highest priority".
The International Earthquake Map of the U.S. Science and Research Agency (USGS) did not record any earthquakes in Iceland last week.
In the last 48 hours, Iceland's weather office reported that there were no earthquakes in the Hekla region.
The significant seismic activity resulting in phase changes was recorded on 10 March following the north-eastern side of the highest calder of the volcano.
Dark clouds have been observed in the foothills of the mountain, which are not due to any volcanic activity.
Clouds could have made it difficult to see if there actually was an eruption.

The former student said that “he spoke slang in class, taught dating skills, and was like a fellow student.”
China has developed the market economy over the last 30 years, although the official communist regime has not been transformed.
Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic reforms have been implemented.
China's economy has grown 90 times since then.
Last year China exported more cars than Germany for the first time, beating the United States as the largest market in the industry.
Over the course of two decades, China's GDP may exceed US GDP.
The tropical cyclone Danielle, the fourth cyclone of the hurricane season in the Atlantic in 2010, was formed in the eastern Atlantic.
A storm about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, reaches a maximum wind speed of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists from the Hurricane National Center expect Danielle to take strength by Wednesday and become a hurricane.
Since the storm is far from the ground, it is difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.

Fortunately, I didn't get hurt, but I won't forget this macabre scene when people tried to break the windows to get out.
People banged the windows, but the windows were made of non-broken glass.
"One of the windows finally broke, so people started going out the window" said the survivors, Francis Kowal.
Stars emit light and heat by using the energy generated by the connection (or stagnating) of hydrogen atoms to form heavier particles.
Scientists are trying to create a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, the solution to this problem is a great deal of difficulty and many years will pass before a useful thermonuclear reactor can be constructed.
The steel pin is drifting on the surface of the water due to the tension on the surface.
The surface tension occurs because the particles of water on its surface attract more than the particles of water and air above them.
Objects such as needles are able to float on a water pane through an invisible coating that particles form on the surface of the water.
The modern spoon is divided by two edges. Two edges increase the grip on the ice, even when they are set at an angle.
The blade is slightly bent, so when the blade leans on one side, the back contacting the ice also bends out.
It makes the skater make a turn. When the skaters lean right, the skater makes a turn to the right, and if the skaters turn left, the skater turns left.
In order to return to the previous level of energy, they need to remove the additional energy obtained from the light.
They're doing it through the emission of a tiny molecule of light called photon.
This process is referred to by scientists as "stimulated radiation emissions", because atoms are stimulated by a bright light, which causes photon of light emissions, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next image shows the atoms that emit photons. Of course, photons are much smaller than on this image.
Photons are even smaller than the particles that form the atoms!
Hundreds of hours of work make the light bulb finally burn and the light bulb stops.
It is necessary to replace the filament lamp. Caution should be exercised when changing the filament lamp.
First turn off the light or switch off the cable.
This is because the current that affects the frame, which contains the metal part of the filament lamp, can seriously break when touching the inside of the holder or the metal base of the filament lamp when it is partially in the holder.
The underlying organ in the circulatory system is the heart pumping the blood.
Blood is derived from the heart by "circulars", which are called arterials, and is given by "wires" called veins. The term "hair vessels" refers to the smallest such "guides".
Triceratops teeth could destroy not only leaves, but also extremely hard branches and roots.
According to some scholars, the triceratops was fed with phags, which are typical plants for the period of the Creed.
This plant looks like a small palm tree with a crown made by sharp, sticking leaves.
A strong paw could be useful for triceratops when he wanted to get the leaves before he went to eat the trunk.
Other scientists say that these plants are very toxic, so it is not possible for dinosaurs to eat them, although today lazy and other animals, e.g. parrots (pomocki dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would the gravity force of the moon Io affect me? By standing on the surface of Io, man weighs less than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on the moon Io. The force of gravity is there, of course, much smaller.
The sun doesn't have a shell like the Earth you can stand on, and the sun is entirely made of gases, fire, and plasma.
The gas is diluted away from the sun.
The outer rim that we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which literally means the circle of light.
Venus's phases, similar to the lunar phases, were observed about three thousand years later (in 1610) by Galileus, and used a telescope for that purpose.
The phases are that light reaches only one side of Venus (or the Moon), the one that is turned to the Sun. The theory of Copernicus, according to which the planets orbit around the Sun, had its confirmation in the phases of Venus.
Jeremiah Horrocks, an English astronomer, observed the transit of Venus several years later, and exactly in 1639.
After the reflection of Danelaw England experienced a long period of peace.
However, in 991, Ethelred had to face the Viking fleet, from which only the Guthrum fleet from a hundred years ago could be compared in terms of size.
The fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, Norway, whose ambition was to get rid of Denmark's dominance over its country.
At the beginning, Ethelred was not in a battle, but he was able to come to an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway and tried to recover his kingdom, although with various consequences.
Hangul is the only specially invented alphabet that is in everyday use. It was discovered in 1444 during King Sejong's reign (1418-1450).
King Sejong sat on the throne as the fourth ruler of the Joseon dynasty and still enjoys great appreciation today.
At first, he will determine the alphabet hangul called Hunmin Jungeum, "the right sounds to teach people".
A lot of theories were formulated about how the sanscrite was born, and one of them talks about the migration of the Aryans who brought their tongue from the west to India.
Sanscryt is an ancient language that is considered the eastern equivalent of European Latin.
The first well-known book in the world was written in a sandcrete. After developing the garland sanscrete simply lost its meaning because of the hierarchy.
Sanscrit is an extremely complex and rich language, from which many modern languages are spoken in India, as do Latin as well as the source of European languages, such as French and Spanish.
After the winning French campaign, the Germans set off with preparations for the invasion of the Great Britain.
Most of the British army's heavy weapons and resources were lost when they left Dunkerka, which is why the army was quite weak.
Nevertheless, the British Navy still exceeded the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and was able to defeat any enemy fleet that would affect the La Manche Channel.
Few British Navy ships were on potential invasion routes because the admirals were afraid of flooding them by the German air attack.
Let's start by explaining Italy's plans. Italy was the "younger brother" of Germany and Japan.
Their armies and the Navy were weaker, even though four new ships were built just before the war began.
The main objectives of Italy were African countries. To take over, they needed a military launch platform to cross the Mediterranean and attack Africa.
In order to do this, they had to eliminate the British base and ships in Egypt. Besides, the Italian warships had no other tasks.
And now it's time for Japan, and Japan was an island country, just like the UK.
Underwater vessels are vessels designed for a longer journey under the surface of water.
The submarines were used during World War I and World War II. They were very slow and had a limited range of shots.
At the beginning of the war they traveled mainly on the surface of the sea, but along with the development and greater accuracy of the radar, submarines were forced to go under water to avoid detection.
The German submarines were called the U-bots. The Germans were perfectly coping with the navigation and operation of submarines.
Germany has successfully benefited from submarines and therefore, due to a lack of trust, they were not wanted to have too many of them after the war.
Yes! King Tinchamon, sometimes called "King Tut" or "King Boy", is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt.
Interestingly, in ancient times it was not considered important, it was not taken into account in most letters of ancient kings.
But when his tomb was discovered in 1922, he became a celebrity. Although many of the ancient tombs were victims of the robbery, this tomb was actually intact.
Most of the items that were buried with Tinchamon were well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
Thanks to the invention of spruce wheels, the Assyrian chariots were lighter, faster and more effective in the pursuit of warriors and other chariots.
Shots from their deadly crossbows could break the armor of enemy soldiers. About 1000 B.C.E. The Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
Cavalry is a military formation made up of armed horsemen. The saddle was not invented at that time, so the Assyrian Cavaliers were taking their horses to the shelter.
There are many famous Greek politicians, scholars and artists. Probably the most famous figure in this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who created two epic masterpieces of Greek literature: Iliada and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular dramatists, whose art is seen among the greatest works in the world literature.
Another famous Greek is Pitagoras, a mathematician, known primarily for his famous claim on sides relations in rectangular triangles.
There are different calculations on the number of Hindus. It is estimated that it is between the second and fourth most commonly used language in the world.
Taking into account or excluding closely related dialects, the total number of native users of the language concerned shall be affected.
According to language estimates, between 340 and 500 million people are used and up to 800 million are able to understand it.
In Hindu and brute languages, vocabulary is similar, but various writings are similar; in daily communication, users of both languages are usually able to communicate.
Sometime in the 15th century, Estonia was under the very large cultural influence of Germany.
Some of the German monks wanted to bring the God of the local population closer, so they invented the literal Estonian language.
It was based on the German alphabet, but one character was added: """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
In the course of time, many words borrowed from German joined together. It was the beginning of enlightenment.
According to tradition, the throne heir after graduation went straight to the army.
However, Charles went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology and then history, gaining 2:2 (the lower degree of second degree).

The European part of Turkey (which covers eastern Throne or Rumelia in the Balkan peninsula) accounts for 3% of the country.
Turkey's territory is more than 1600 kilometres long (1000 miles) and 800 kilometres (500 miles) wide, approximately rectangular.
Turkey's area, including lakes, extends to 783 562 square kilometres (300 948 square miles), of which 755 688 square kilometres (991 773 square miles) lies in South-West Asia and 23 764 square kilometres (9174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey's area makes it the 37th country of the world size, about the size of the metropolitan France and the United Kingdom taken together.
Turkey has access to the sea from three sides: from the west to the Aegean Sea, from the north to the Black Sea and from the south to the Mediterranean.
Luxembourg has a long history, but independence was achieved in 1839.
Today's parts of Belgium belonged to Luxembourg in the past, but became the property of Belgium after the Belgian revolution of the 1930s.
Although Luxembourg has always tried to maintain neutrality, it has not avoided German occupation during World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg joined the organisation, which is now known as the European Union, as a Member State and founding Member State.
Drugagyal Jong is the ruins of the fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of Paro district (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that in 1649 Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built a fortress to celebrate his victory over Tibetan-Mongol forces.
After the 1951 fire there were only some relics of Drubgyal Jong, e.g. the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was maintained and protected and is still one of the most impressive attractions in Bhutan.
In the 18th century Cambodia was squeezed between two powerful neighbors: Thailand and Vietnam.
In the eighteenth century, the Thais had repeatedly harassed Cambodia with invasions, and in 1772 they destroyed the city of Phnom Penh.
At the end of the 18th century, the Vietnamese were also armed with Cambodia.
18% of Venezuela's population remain unemployed, and most of those who have employment are working in the gray zone.
Two out of three Venezuelans who work in the service sector, almost every fourth in industry, and every fifth in agriculture.
Oil plays an important role in the Venezuelan economy, which exports more of this raw material than it imports, even though only one percent of the population is working in this sector.

In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a hybrid of orchids, obtained the status of a national flower.
Every year, nearly 1.5 million herbivorous animals move in pursuit of the rain from the northern hills to the southern plains, along the road through the Mara River.
And then again north, across the west, again across the Mara River, after April rains.
Serengeti district consists of Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Protection Area, the Wild Animals Reserve in Tanzania and the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires standard and traditional skills and tools known during interactive activities (creating scenery, editing movies and sound recordings, storytelling, etc.).
To design interactively, re-evaluate media production assumptions and learn to think non-linearly.
In an interactive project, elements must be combined, but they must also make sense as a separate whole.
The problem with the variable-focal lens is that the complexity and number of elements needed to get a certain range of focal distances are much larger than in the fixed-focal lens.
This is a growing problem as lens manufacturers are reaching higher standards in their production.
Thanks to this, variable focus lenses can take photos with quality comparable to those obtained by lenses with fixed focal length.
Another minus variable-focal lenses is the fact that the maximum width of the aperture (speed) of the lens is usually smaller.
Therefore, cheaper variable-focal lenses cause difficulty with low lighting if no flash lamp is used.
One of the most common problems when converting to DVD format is to adjust image size.
The satisfaction of all customers is a key criterion for the production of most televisions.
Therefore everything that appears on the TV screen had cut edges at the bottom, at the top and at the side.
This is to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This function is called overscan.
Unfortunately, when creating a DVD it will probably also be cut, and if the inscriptions in the recording are too close to the bottom, they will not be fully displayed.
Tournaments, banquets and knights of the Round Table for a long time are elements of imagination inspired by the traditional motif of the medieval castle.
Even standing among thousands of years of ruins, the sounds and smells of the long past battles can be easily invoked and practically heard by the stuttering of the hoof on the bruch, as well as the feeling of fear from the dungeons.
But is this reality a builder of our imagination, and why is it started to build castles? How were they designed and raised?
The standard Kirby Muxloe castle for this period is a more fortified house than a real castle.
Large glazed windows and thin walls would not be able to resist a strong attack for too long.
In the 1980s, when Lord Hastings started building, the country was relatively calm, it was only needed to defend itself from small groups of wandering robbers.
The balance of power was a system whereby European nations sought to maintain national sovereignty for all countries in Europe.
In line with this concept, all European nations had to be attuned to the entry of one nation into power and therefore governments often changed allies in order to maintain international balance.
The first armed conflict at stake was the war on Spanish success.
It was a major change, because European powers would no longer have a pretext for religious wars, which is why the thirty-year war would be the last war that could be called religious.
The Artemida temple in Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 B.C.E. as a result of the fire set by Herostratus.
The story tells us that he sought fame at all costs. The detestable Ephesians have announced that the name of Herostrates should be erased from human memory.
The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander offered to cover the costs of rebuilding the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander’s death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.
Make sure that your hand is as relaxed as possible by hitting all notes correctly – and try not to make unnecessary movements of your fingers.
This way you avoid getting tired. Remember that you do not have to push the keys harder to make the sound louder, as it is in the case of piano.
To get more volume by playing the accordion, you should move the bowls with more pressure or more speed.
Mystics is to seek to unite or identify with the final reality, divinity, spiritual truth or God, or to achieve their full consciousness.
The believer seeks direct experience, intuition or insight into the depths of divine reality / deity or deity.
Religions have a certain life - style, or engage in practices that aim to develop such experiences.
Mysticism is different from other forms of faith and religious worship, which puts pressure on personal, direct experience of the unique state of consciousness, especially this mild, in-depth, blessed, and even ecstatic state.
Sikhism is a religion that was born on an Indian subcontinent in the Punjabi region in the 15th century due to a split within the Indian tradition.
Sikhs do not identify their religion with Hinduism, although they admit that it has Indian roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means "the path of guru". Guru is the basis of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it is so important that it is the essence of Sikh's beliefs.
This religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539), and its successors include another nine gurus.
However, in June 1956, Khrushchev's promises with residents in Poland were confronted when labour demonstrations against food shortages and wage cuts turned into protests aimed at communism as such.
Although Khrushchev finally sent tanks to restore order, he went into economic concessions and agreed that Władysław Gomółk would take the position of Prime Minister to enjoy the popularity of Władysław Gomółk.
The civilization of the Indus Valley existed in the Bronze Age in the north-western part of the Indian sub-continent, including the majority of today's Pakistan, as well as parts of the north-western regions of India and the north-eastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the river Indus, from which it was named.
Although there are scientists who believe that because this civilization existed in the river basin today, it can also be called the Indus-Saraswati Civilization, while others use the name "Harappa Civilization", referring to Harappa, the first settlement discovered in the 20th century.
Progress in medicine has contributed to the military nature of the Roman Empire.
The first medical recruitment was initiated by Emperor Augustus and the first Roman medical unit to serve wounded soldiers in battles was created.
The surgeons knew various sedatives, including morphine obtained from extracts from the poppy seed and copolamine from black lukewarm seeds.
They've gained amputation to protect patients from gangrene, as well as the use of compression belts and arterial clamps to inhibit blood flow.
For many centuries, the Roman Empire has achieved much in the field of medicine and has influenced the knowledge we have today.
The Origami of the Pureland type are only allowed to bend once, not to make complex bends, e.g. bends and bends, and all bends must have a rectangular position.
John Smith developed it in the 1970s to help those who have no origami experience, or those whose mobility is limited.
In children, race awareness and stereotypes develop early, and these stereotypes affect behaviour.
For example, children who identify with a race minority who, according to stereotypes, do not do well at school are generally not doing well when they learn about this stereotype.
MySpace is currently the third most popular site in the United States, covering 54 million profiles.
These websites attract great attention, especially in the educational environment.
These sites have positive aspects, including the possibility of easily configuring a class site containing blogs, video material, photos and other elements.
You can access this site by providing only one web address, which makes it easier to remember and write to students who may have problems writing and writing on the keyboard.
This can be adjusted to facilitate reading, as well as with any or a small amount of color.
Attention disturbance syndrome "is a neurological event, which is traditionally defined by means of a triad of symptoms: impulsiveness, deconcentration and overstimulation or excessive energy".
This is not a disability, it is a learning disorder that "touches between 3 and 5 percent of children, maybe even 2 million American children".
Children with ADD have difficulty in focusing on learning, but for that they can focus on what makes them enjoy, for example, playing games or watching your favorite cartoon or writing sentences without any interference.
These children tend to get into trouble because “they take risky behaviors, get into fights and undermine authorities” to stimulate the brain because they cannot obtain this stimulation by normal methods.
ADD has an impact on peer relations who may have problems understanding why someone is acting in such a way as to write and why their maturity level is different.
The ability to learn and learn has changed as described above, and the pace of learning has changed.
The ratio to obtaining information was different. The pressure was no longer in the individual memory, but it became more important to be able to call for texts.
In principle, the Renaissance has significantly changed the approach to learning and dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other chief hominids, they no longer use their hands to move, carry weight or move between trees.
The hand and the foot of the chimpanzees are similar to the size and length, which shows that the hand is used to carry the body weight while walking based on the bent fingers of the hand.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, and it has more straightened fingers.
The fossilised handbones from two to three million years ago show how the specialization of the hand changed, from movement to manipulation.
According to some, frequent dreams can lead to exhaustion.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that conscious dreams prolong the time between REM phases.
If less ludox sleep phases fall overnight, the problem becomes a low frequency of the state in which you actually sleep and your body regenerates.
It's as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The frequency with which the brain tries to dream consciously during a given night affects the effect.
In fact, since the start of the Italian case in North Africa, it has not been great. A week since the Italians declared war on 10 June 1940, 11 British Husaria took over Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
General Lastucci, chief of the engineering forces of the tenth Italian army, was captured by the British in an ambush east of Badria.
On 28 June, Marshal Italy Balbo, Governor General of Libya, and clearly the successor of Mussolini, was killed by a fratrical fire when he landed in Tobruk.
Modern fencing is played at many levels, from college students to professional competitions and Olympics.
Most often, this sport takes the form of a duel between two swordsmen.
Golf is a game where the participants use the bats to direct the balls to the holes.
18 holes are played in the standard round, the players usually start with the first hole on the field and end on the 18th.
Whoever wins the smallest number of hits or attacks with a stick in his account.
The game is played on grass, which is shorter around the hole and is called green.
Recreational tourism is probably the most common type of tourism, most people associated with travelling.
That's when people go to places that are completely different from what they're surrounded by every day to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and camp fields are usually the most popular places used by holiday tourists.
Cultural tourism means a type of tourism that involves learning about the history and culture of visited places.
Tourists can visit different specific objects of their country or they can only focus on one area.
The colonists, looking at this activity, also called for reinforcements.
The forces strengthening the front positions were composed of the first and third regiments of New Hampshire, which count 200 people, led by Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
At the northern end of the position occupied by the Colonians, Sub-command Stark was set up.
When the tide opened a free passage along the Mystic River from the north-eastern side of the peninsula, they quickly extended the strengthening of the short stone wall from the northern edge of the shore on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark put a stake in the distance of about 100 feet (30 m) from the reinforcement and ordered not to shoot until the inflated one reaches this line.
The U.S. plan was to establish coordinated attacks on three different sides.
General John Cadwalder will begin a diversion against the British garrison in Bordentown to block any support.
General James Ewing was to cross the river at Trenton Ferry along with a 700-person common movement unit, take the bridge over Assupink Creek and stroke the escape of enemy troops.
At the back of the attack there were 2400 armed troops who were to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and separate, forming two troops, one under the command of Greene, the other under Sullivan's command to allow the attack before dawn.
When the distance of the gear changes from one quarter to a half mile, the speed loses meaning, and stamina becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, the top runner in half a mile, which can break two minutes, must have a sufficiently high speed, but the stamina should be taken care of at all costs.
Some winter cross-country crossings combined with upper body training at the gym are the best preparation for the cross-country season.
Proper nutrition does not guarantee excellent results, but it may significantly affect the overall form of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, applying effective irrigating habits and understanding various aspects of supplementation can help athletes to improve results and enhance sports pleasure.
Distance runs are relatively inexpensive sport, but there are many myths about several necessary equipment elements.
You can purchase products according to needs, but most of them will have a negligible or zero impact on productivity.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a given product, although it does not offer any real benefits.
Atom can be considered as one of the fundamental building elements of all matter.
It is a very complex unit, which, according to the simplified model of Bohra, from the central core around which the electrons are located, which is somewhat like the planets orbiting around the Sun – see Figure 1.1.
The kernel consists of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.
In terms of electricity, protons are positive, electrons are negative, and neutrons have no charge.
To see what happened to the victim, you must first assess whether the site of the event poses a threat to you.
As you approach the victim, keep an eye on its location, as well as watch out for natural warning signals.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, you'll only make things worse.
The study has shown that depression, fear and pessimistic attitudes were closely related to the pain and weakness of people suffering from cross pain.
Only the effects of catastrophic thinking depended on regular weekly physical exercises, but such dependence did not occur in the event of depression and fear.
Regularly active people need more support when it comes to a negative perception of pain to distinguish chronic pain and discomfort from normal movement.
The view, the ability to see, is dependent on the organs of the sense of vision, or eyes.
The construction of the eye can be very different in terms of complexity, which depends on the requirements of the body.
Different systems have different possibilities, they are sensitive to different wavelengths and they differ in degree of visual acuity, and they also require different processes to interpret input data, and the appropriate number of organs to function optimally.
The population is called a collection of organisms of one species living in a particular geographical area.
All individuals in the population with a particular phenotype are called monomorphic.
When individuals are characterised by several variants of a given feature, they are polymorphic.
The shells of military ants march and set up nests also in other phases.
During the journey, ant army marches at night and camps throughout the day.
The colonia gives the beginning of the nomadic phase when the amount of food available has been reduced. During this phase, the colony creates temporary nests that are changed every day.
Each such nomadic rally or march takes about 17 days.
What is the cell? This word comes from a Latin "cell", meaning "small room", and was forged by a researcher to whom he observed the structure of the cork under the microscope.
The cell is a basic builder of all living organisms that contain at least one cell.
In fact, the role of cells in life study is so fundamental and crucial that they are often called "the components of life".
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses to the body so that blood flow is not disturbed.
These nerve impulses wander through the body at such a speed that they help protect them from potential dangers.
Tornades hit a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything on their way.
The tornados take out trees, remove boards from buildings and throw cars into the air. The most violent two percent of the tornado lasts over three hours.
In these monstrous storms the wind reaches up to 480 km/h (133 m/s, 300 mph).
For many thousands of years, people have been making and using lenses to view objects in magnification.
But the first real telescopes were built in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to zoom in and enlarge remote objects.
Greed and selfishness will always accompany us, and the essence of our cooperation is that when the majority benefit, acting selfishly, short-term profits will be greater.
One should hope that most people will open their eyes and see that working with others is the best long-term option for them.
Many people dream of a day when you will be able to travel to another star and discover other worlds; some wonder what is there, some believe that other planets live outsiders or other life forms.
But if it ever happens, it's probably not for a long time. The stars are far from each other, these neighbouring ones often share billions of miles.
Perhaps your grandkids will ever be in a strange world thinking about their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made of many cells, eating things and digesting them. Most animals can move.
The brain is an organ that can only be found in animals, and yet not in everyone, e.g. jellyfish has no brain.
There's no place on earth where there's no animals, there's underground tunnels, they're floating in the oceans, they're floating in the sky.
Cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of living organisms (things).
The word "cell" is the Latin word "cella" meaning a small room.
Looking at living beings under a microscope, you can see that they are built from small squares or bullets.
Robert Hook, an English biologist, looked at the cork under the microscope and saw small squares.
From the look of the room, he was the first person to see dead cells.
Elements and relationships can move from one state to another and do not change.
Gas nitrogen still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. In liquid form it is denser, but the particles are identical.
Another example is water, consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen.
The molecular structure is identical for gas, liquids and solid bodies.
Although the state of focus may change, the chemical composition remains unchanged.
Time is everywhere around us, affects every action we do, and at the same time it's so hard to understand it.
For thousands of years time has been the subject of research by scholars, philosophers and theologians.
We experience time as a course of events coming from the future, through the present, to the past.
Time is also used to compare the duration of events (of their length over time).
You can indicate the duration of time yourself by observing the recurrences of a cyclical event, which distinguishes between regular repeatability.
Today, computers are used to edit images and videos.
Advanced animations can be created on the computer and are increasingly used for television and cinematography.
Music is often recorded with advanced computers that process and mix sounds.
In the 19th and 20th centuries it was long recognised that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maoris, hunting giant birds called moa.
According to this theory, the Maoris sailed the Great Fleet from Polynesia to New Zealand, and they took it to the people of Moriori, and they settled as an agricultural community.
However, the latest evidence shows that the Moriori tribe was a group of continental Maoris who moved from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their own peaceful culture.
On the islands of Chatham there were other tribes, Maoris, which emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, there were a few cases of abuse, and they were eventually killed.
Those who have been giving for several decades have made us truly aware of the value of our qualities and affections, and on the other hand we have been able to look at difficulties and failures.
When we listened to people who were telling stories about their personal life, family or work, we received many valuable information about the past and about personalities that had a positive or negative impact on the culture of organisations.
Although understanding your history does not imply understanding of culture, it at least helps us to understand where we are in the history of the organization.
By assessing the successes and awareness of individual failures, as well as the entire group of participants will better learn about the values, mission and motivation of the organisation.
In this case, people opened up new changes and a new direction for the local church, mentioning entrepreneurial behavior and its success in the past.
Such success stories mitigated the concerns of change and inspired a positive attitude towards change in the future.
Methods of solving problems using different concepts or areas to find a solution called convergence thinking patterns.
Such mental attitudes focus on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as identifying facts, re-use of available techniques and collecting information.
The most important element of this thinking: there is only one correct answer. You only take into account two answers – good and bad.
This type of reasoning is linked to specific science or standard procedures.
People of this type of thinking can think logically, remember patterns, solve problems and research.
People are the most capable species when it comes to reading other people's minds.
It follows that we can effectively predict what other people perceive and intend, what they believe, what they know and what they want.
The most important of these skills is understanding the intentions of others, as this can help to resolve the possible ambiguities resulting from the actions carried out.
For example, seeing someone break a window in a car, we'd probably assume they're trying to steal someone's car.
He should be judged differently if he lost his car keys and tried to hack into his vehicle.
The MRI is based on a phenomenon called nuclear resonance (NMR), discovered by Felix Bloch (a worker at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (a Harvard worker) in the 1930s.
In this resonance, atoms emit delicate radio signals under the influence of magnetic field and radio waves.
In 1970, doctor and scientist Raymond Damadian discovered how to use magnetic resonance imaging for medical diagnostic purposes.
Four years later, the patent was the first patent in the world in the field of magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the scanner for the magnetic resonance of the whole body, which he called "The Evil One".
Asynchronous communication gives time to think and answer to another person.
This allows students to work at their own pace and to control the pace of the instruction.
In addition, there are less time limits, with the possibility of working in flexible hours (Bremer, 1998).
The possibility of using the Internet and the web gives students access to information at any time.
Students can also report questions to teachers at any time of the day and expect relatively fast answers instead of waiting for the next direct meeting.
Post- Modernistic approach to science gives freedom from absolute truths. There is no one good way to learn.
Indeed, there is not one thing to learn from, and it is a process of learning that occurs in the context of experience between the person learning and the knowledge that is presented.
Our current experience in television programs that present information, education, teaching and providing practical advice ("the same thing").
Many of us are watching on TV programs that pass on knowledge that we will never use, and show experiences that will never happen to us.
We'll never refurbish the car, put the fountain in the yard, go to Peru to watch the ancient ruins, or rebuild the neighbor's house.
Submersible fibre connections with Europe and broadband satellite services make Greenland good connectivity, and 93% of the population has access to the Internet.
Your hotel or host (in case of accommodation in a guest house or private accommodation) will have Wi-Fi or a computer connected to the Internet, and in all facilities there is an Internet cafe with public Wi-Fi.
As mentioned above, although the word "Eskimos" remains accepted in the United States, it is people outside the Arctic, especially in Canada who find it offensive.
Although you will hear that word from the natives of Greenland, foreigners should not use it.
Greenlandese autochtons themselves are called Innuites in Canada and Kalaalleq (Calaallit), meaning "Grenlanders" in Greenland.
The crime and the evil will toward foreigners are not really known in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "hazardous surroundings".
The cold seems to be the only real threat the unprepared people will face.
You must wear enough warm clothes if you visit Greenland in the colder times of the year (the further north, the colder).
Very long summer days can cause problems with sufficient sleep and related health problems.
In the summer, you have to be careful of local mosquitoes that do not move the disease, but can prove intimidating.

The location for the most popular areas, such as the Camp of the Light Angel adjacent to the Upior Rancz, is usually filled with requests received at the first opening date.
The number of entry permits is limited, applications are available on the basis of who first, the better one.
Traveling in South Africa is a wonderful way to admire the beauty of the whole region, as well as to reach places outside the normal tourist trails.
If this is planned well, a normal car can be sufficient, but it is strongly recommended that the four-wheel drive vehicle be reached and many locations can only be reached with such a vehicle with a high axle distribution.
When planning, it is important to remember that although South Africa is stabilised, not all neighbouring countries are such.

Victoria Falls is a city located in the western region of Zimbabwe, near the town of Livingstone, just across the border, in Zambia, and close to the border with Botswana.
The city is located in the vicinity of waterfalls, which are the main attraction, but this popular tourist place offers a lot of advantages related to a longer stay, both for adventurers and those who like to visit.
The amount of water is much higher and the waterfall looks more impressive with the arrival of the rainy season, which lasts from November to March.
I'm sure you'll get wet if you walk across bridges or trails along waterfalls.
On the other hand, it is so precisely because the amount of water is so large that watching real waterfalls will be difficult – through all this water!
The Tomb of Tutonchamona (KV62). It is possible that the most famous tomb in the Valley is KV62, where Howard Carter discovered the most intact burial site of a young king in 1922.
Compared with most royal graves, the tomb of Tinkhamona is not especially worth visiting because it is small and not very richly decorated.
Anyone who wants to see the destruction of a mummy while trying to take her out of the coffin will be disappointed because only the head and arms are visible.
The fabulous riches discovered in the tomb were transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Tourists who have limited time will do better by going somewhere else.
The temple of Phnom Krom, 12 km south-west of Siem Reap. This temple on the top of the hill was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
It is worth climbing the mountain for the immersive atmosphere of the temple and the view of Lake Tonle Sap.

Make sure the agent who makes the reservation for you knows the Galapagos well and knows many different boats.
Thus, your individual interests and/or limitations will be taken into account in the selection of the boat.
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, Chile was under the authorities of Inca, and the native Araukans (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
Mapuche was also one of the last autonomous, indigenous American groups that were not fully absorbed under Spanish-speaking authorities until Chile became independent.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in a period of Napoleonic wars which for a few years deprived Spain of a functioning central government), the decisive victory over the Spanish took place only in 1818.

The world fair (called as the World Exhibition or simply Expo) is a great international celebration of art and science.
The participating countries present artistic and educational exhibitions in the national pavilions to present global problems and the history and culture of their country.
International Gardening Exhibitions are special events where flowers, botanical gardens and everything else about plants are presented.
Although in theory they can take place every year (until they are in different countries), in practice they are not.
These events normally last between three and six months and are organised in areas of a size of at least 50 hectares.
In the history of the cinema, many different types of film were used. The most popular is the standard 35 mm tape (a 36 mm x 24 mm negative).
When it is finished, it can usually be easily supplemented and the resolution it provides is quite comparable to the current digital mirror.
Part of medium-format cameras use negatives with 6 to 6 cm format, and more specifically 56 to 56 mm.
The effect is the resolution of almost four times the resolution of 35 mm (3136 mm2 compared to 864 mm2).
Fauna and flora are one of the most difficult topics for a photographer, requiring a combination of happiness, patience, experience and good equipment.
Nature photography often seems to be obvious, but just as it is with photography in general, one picture can express more than a thousand words.
Long telebids are often needed to photograph wild nature, although objects such as a flock of birds or small creatures require other lenses.
Many exotic animals find it difficult to meet, and sometimes reservations have regulations for taking photographs for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be either shy or aggressive. It can be cold or hot or the environment can be unfriendly for other reasons.
There are over 5,000 different languages worldwide, including more than 20 users using at least 50 million.

A lot of things have to be considered before you leave, and then during your trip.
When you're on your way, get on your way to the differences and surprises. Maniers, rules, traffic, accommodations, standards, language, etc. will be to some extent different from your home country.
You always have to remember that if you want to avoid disappointment or even defile local customs and practices.
The first travel agencies were established in the 19th century. It is worth taking advantage of the offer of travel agencies if the trip includes places where nature, culture, language or the poor travellers have not experienced before.

You have contact with local germs at home all the time, so there's a good chance you're already immune.
However, in those parts of the world where there are bacteria with which your body has not been in contact before, you are putting yourself at greater risk of problems.
Moreover, when the climate is warmer, bacteria grow faster and are able to survive beyond the body.
Hence the plagues of Delhi Bella, the curse of Pharaoh, the vengeance of Montusemy and others related to them.
While breathing problems occur in colder climates, in hot climates there are quite often intestinal problems, usually very troublesome but not causing dangers.
If you travel for the first time to a developing country or to a new part of the world, you can experience cultural shock.
Many regular experienced travelers have been defeated by ignorance of travel across developing countries, where many minor cultural differences can quickly be accumulated.
Especially in the first days it is worth to go crazy and spend money on high-quality hotels in Western style, food and services to make it easier to acclimatize.
Do not sleep on the mattress or ground pad in areas where the local fauna is unknown.
If you're going to camp under the sky, take a field bed or a hammock to protect yourself from snakes, scorpions and other dangerous animals.
Let your house fill up with a rich coffee aroma in the morning and a relaxing aroma of Romanian tea in the evening.
During your vacations at your place of residence, you have more time to make up for something really special.
If you want an adventure, don't hesitate and prepare some freshly pressed juices or smoothie:
Perhaps you'll discover some simple drink that you'll prepare for your breakfast before your daily responsibilities absorb you.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, visit bars and pubs in the neighborhoods where you rarely live.
If you don't know a medical jargon, then you're told that "infectious" doesn't mean the same as "harmful."
Infectious disease causes a pathogen such as virus, bacteria, fungi or other parasites.
Infectious disease is an easily transmitted disease if we are close to the infected person.
Vaccinations for various diseases are often a requirement for governments to come or leave the country.
These requirements may often depend on who you have visited or intends to visit.
One of the great advantages of Charlotte, North Carolina, is a great number of high quality attractions for families.
People in other regions often say that the main reason for the move is the profamily climate, and tourists often think that it is easy to move in this town with children.
Over the past two decades, the number of attractions that are child-friendly in the city of Charlotte has increased significantly.
In general, families living in Charlotte do not use taxis, although in some circumstances this form of transport may prove useful.
For the transport of more than 2 passengers there is a charge, so this may be more expensive than necessary.
The coolest place on Earth is Antarctica located around the southern pole.
Tourist trips cost a lot, require good physical condition, are possible only in the summer (November to February) and are mainly limited to the peninsula, the islands and the Sea of Rossa.
During the summer, about fifty bases live in these areas, but only a small number of workers spend the winter here.
Inland Antarctica is a depleted plateau that covers 2-3 km of ice.
The occasional special air trips take place on the ground for alpine purposes or to reach the pole, where there is a large base.
Travers on the southern pole (also called the highway) is a route of 1600 km from the McMurdo station on the Sea of Ross to the pole.
After this beaten snow with ice cracks filled and marked flags, you can only move in special tractors tow with fuel and provinant.
They are not light and returnable, therefore the trail on a long section of the Transantarctic Mountains and leads further to the plateau.
In the winter, accidents occur most often on the sluice roads, pavements and above all on the stairs.
The shoes with good sole are basic. Summer shoes tend to slide on ice and snow, and even some winter shoes may not fit.
The carrier must have a deep cut, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more respectively, and the material must keep the softness at low temperatures.
Some shoes are equipped with spikes, and under slender conditions there is a cover with spikes suitable for most shoes, for wearing heels or soles.
The heels must be low and wide; better grip is obtained by breaking sand, gravel or salt (aluminium chloride) on the roads and paths.
The avalanches are not an unusual phenomenon; since the steep slopes are able to maintain only a limited amount of snow, its excess will continue in the form of an avalanche.
The problem is, the snow is sticky, so something must cause him to come down, and the snow coming down is another mass of him.
Sometimes the original activator is the sun warming snow, sometimes the greater snowfall, and sometimes other natural events, often human.
Tornado is a spinning air pole with very low pressure, pulling the surrounding air into the middle and up.
They cause strong winds (often 100 to 200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air when the tornado moves.
They begin as rains falling from stormy clouds, and when they touch the earth, they become "tornades."
The PPN (virtual private network) providers are an excellent way to circumvent political censorship and commercial IP filtering according to location.
They exceed a number of proxy servers: they redirect the entire Internet traffic, not just http.
Their typical advantages are higher capacity and better service quality. Because they are encrypted, they make spying difficult.
Media companies lie well when the aim is "prevention of piracy".
In fact, regional codes do not affect any illegal copying; a copy of all the bits on the disk will be well played on any device on which the original will be played.
In fact, this is about more control of these companies over their markets and generating large profits.
The calls are made via the Internet and therefore you do not need to use the services of the telephone operator located at your place of residence or at the place of travel.
You also don't need to get a local number from the community where you live; you can have a satellite internet connection in Chicken, Alaska, and select a number assigned to sunny Arizona.
It is often necessary to buy a global number separately in order to be able to receive calls from a public commuting telephone network (PTSN).
Real-time text translation applications – applications that can automatically translate entire text segments from one language to another.
There are applications in this category that can translate foreign-language texts placed on characters or other objects in the real world when the user directs his smartphone to them.
Translation programs have improved significantly and now often offer more or less correct translations (rarely text with no meaning), but be careful because there is always a possibility of mistake.
Google is one of the most popular applications of this type and allows you to translate in offline mode when you download the required language data.
GPS navigation on smartphones is probably the easiest and most convenient way to move in a foreign country.
Instead of buying new GPS maps or a self-global GPS device or instead of paying for them in car rental, you can save and buy your own navigation.
If you do not have data on your phone or your phone is out of reach, the action may be limited or unavailable.
On each corner you will find a shop with a chaotic offer of prepaid phone cards that can be used in telephone machines or on ordinary phones.
Most cards are suitable for calling in all places, but some offer favourable rates for calls to specific groups of countries.
Access to these services is often obtained via a free phone number, which you can call for free with most telephones.
The rules used in standard photography relate to video recording, perhaps even more so.
If photographing is forbidden, don't even think about filming it.
Before using drones, check what you can film and what licenses and licenses are required.
Even when the rules in your area do not prohibit this, drone flying over the airport or a group of people is generally not recommended.
Air travel is rarely booked directly on airlines, instead of first finding and comparing prices.
It happens that the same flight has extremely different prices depending on the flight search engine, so it is worth comparing different results and checking prices on the airline website before making your reservation.
Although a short tourist or business visit does not require a visa in some countries, if you are coming as a foreign student, your stay will probably be longer.
In general, a longer stay in another country will require an early visa.
In the case of student visas, other requirements and procedures for the submission of applications are normally applicable than for normal travel or business visas.
In most countries, a letter of tender will be required from the institution in which you want to study, as well as a certificate that you have funds to maintain for at least the first year of the course.
Contact the immigration institution and department in the country where you want to study to read the detailed requirements.
If you're not a diplomat, then working abroad, you have a duty to file a tax return in the country where you're staying.
Income tax has a different structure across countries, and tax rates and thresholds vary greatly from country to country.
Income tax in some United States and Canada is imposed at both federal and local levels, so rates and compartments may vary between regions.
When you return to your homeland, there is no immigration check or it is only a formality, while customs control can be burdensome.
Be aware of what you can and cannot deliver, and report the goods beyond the permitted limits.
The easiest way to start a business of writing about travel is to polish your skills on some popular travel blog.
Once you have mastered the rules for formating and editing online, you can create your own website.
You can contribute to positive changes by engaging in volunteering during your journey, but it's not just about giving something to yourself.
Life and volunteering abroad are an excellent way to learn about other cultures, new people, new self, and to gain new perspectives and gain new skills.
This can also be a good way to increase the budget and allow for a longer stay somewhere, as many volunteers offer accommodation and board, and some even a small salary.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. With some of these routes you can still use it. See if you do not need special permits that can be heavy to gain.
The White Sea-Baltic Channel runs from the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea through Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Sankt Petersburg, using rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is connected to Volga, so today it is also possible to sail Russia, leaving the Caspian Sea.
You can be sure that when you arrive in the marina, the situation is quite clear. You will meet other water autostoppers who will share information with you.
In general, you will hang announcements in which you offer help, walk down the docks, discuss people washing their yachts, try to establish contacts with sailors in bars, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible, and soon everyone will know you, and they'll tell the people on whose boat they're looking for someone.
It is important to carefully select an airline implementing the programme for frequent passengers (Frequent Flyer) within the framework of the airline alliance.
Although you may think that intuition is directed by you when you choose the airline you fly most often, you should remember that there are many benefits that are often offered, and points for those flying are often higher in a different line from the same group.
United Arab Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines are airlines that have significantly expanded the range of flights to Africa, and connections to many of the largest cities on this continent are available at more competitive prices compared to European airlines.
From 2014 onwards, Turkish Airlines has operated flights to 39 locations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra time to travel, see what the total price for traveling around Africa looks like compared to the price of traveling around the world.
Do not forget to take into account the costs of additional visas, departure taxes, ground transport, etc. for all places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world only on the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is narrowed down due to the lack of transatlantic routes.
No airline alliance covers all three transoceanic flights on the southern hemisphere (SkyTeam does not include any of them).
However, the Star Alliance does not cover only the eastern part of the South Pacific, from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which supports the LATAM Oneworld flight.
If you want to avoid the southern Pacific and the western coast of South America, there are several other options available besides this flight (see below).
In 1994, in Azerbaijan, the region of Upper Karabach, an Armenian ethnically, declared war to the Azers.
With the support of the Armenians, a new Republic was established, but no country with a well-established position, including Armenia, officially does not recognise it.
Diplomatic oars continue to spoil the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The district of Canals (holender name: Grachtengordel) is a well-known 17th century district, which surrounds Biennestad in Amsterdam.
The whole neighborhood is on the UNESCO World Heritage List in recognition of the unique cultural and historical value, while the prices of the properties here belong to the highest in the country.
It consists of five small coastal villages (Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso) located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
For centuries, people have been building houses on an uneven, steep land, all the way to the cliffs, from which the sea is viewed.
Part of its charm is a lack of visible development. The villages can be reached by paths, trains and boats, but cannot be reached by cars.
The French-speaking inhabitants of Belgium and Switzerland use a different variety of this language than the French, but these differences do not bother to communicate effectively.
Particularly numbering in the French-speaking language of Belgium and Switzerland has certain special characteristics that are different from those in the French language used in France, and some words are also mentioned.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss could learn from the standard French school, and they could understand you if you were using the standard French numeral system.
In many places in the world, wavering is a friendly gesture that means "hello."
However, in Malaysia, at least in its rural areas, this gesture means "come" and it is similar to that used in some Western countries when it is referred to by a finger pointing to it – it should only be used for this purpose.
Similarly, a British tourist in Spain may find it inappropriate to wave with his hand towards a man who waves (not to the one to whom he waves) a gesture calling for his return.
Auxiliary languages are artificial languages or languages created to facilitate communication between people who would otherwise have a problem with communication.
They are something other than French lingua, which are natural or organic languages, predominant for various reasons as a means of communication between users of different languages.
During the warm days, tourists can experience mirages that look like water (or other things).
It may be dangerous if the traveler follows the mirage, losing valuable energy and the rest of the water.
Even in the hottest deserts of the night can be very cold. Hypothermia poses a real risk if you do not have warm clothes.
Traveling through the rainforest, you have to watch out for mosquitoes, especially during the summer season.
When you drive through a subtropical rainforest and open the door of the vehicle for a few seconds while you get in, the mosquitoes are enough to become your passengers on the cap.
Birds’ influenza (also known as avian influenza) may become infected with both birds and mammals.
Less than a thousand cases were observed among humans, but some proved fatal.
Most cases involved poultry workers, but birds are also at risk.
The trees of the fiords and valleys are characteristic of Norway, which are suddenly rapidly changing into a high, fairly equal plateau.
These plateaus are often called "vidde" – meaning a wide, endless space without trees.
In Rogaland and Agder, it is usually referred to as "hei", which means the treeless emptiness, often raised by a moor.
The refrigerators are not still, they are falling down from above. This will cause cracks and cracks that can be covered with snow bridges.
The walls and ceiling of the ice cave can collapse, and the crevices can be nailed.
At the edge of the icebergs, large blocks go by, falling down and perhaps passing away from their edge.
The tourist season at mountain stations usually reaches its peak during the period of baby summer.
However, in the winter, there is a whole new glow and charm, as there is a lot of snow in many mountain stations, so there are attractions such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still have funeral fares in their offer, slightly reducing the cost of a last-minute funeral flight.
The airlines that have such an offer include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the USA or Canada, as well as WestJet.
In all cases direct booking is required through telephone contact with the airline.
