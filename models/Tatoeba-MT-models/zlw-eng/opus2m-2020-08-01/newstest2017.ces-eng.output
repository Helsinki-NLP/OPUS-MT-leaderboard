The eight-year-old chef was found dead in a shop in San Francisco.
The eight-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was a local store steps this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he can’t think of anyone who would want to hurt him and adds: “He finally started to do well. ”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, who gave the office of a medical practitioner.
The Sanfrancian police department has reported that this is a violent death and an investigation.
The brother of the victim Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who had previously been a regular chef in Boston, had acquired his dream chef's job at Sons & Daughters' restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters restaurant spokesperson said that they were "shocked and destroyed" by his death.
“We have a small team that works as a closely connected family, and we will miss them very much,” the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.

He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always made us food, he made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any fights.
He was the brother who took things the way they were.
"Though everything else in the world was wrong, he was a unbroken diamond which irradiated every day", he said.

The Czech railways invested over 31 billion in the modernisation of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the last six years, the state carrier has invested over CZK 31 billion in modernising vehicles.
The third of the cars is currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for the modernisation of individual years with the exception of 2012 are falling gradually.
Over 31 billion crowns have invested in modernising vehicles over the last six years.
The third of the cars is currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was shown in a reduction in average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic wagons.
A larger share of the investment was put by the carrier in regional transport, which was directed at approximately 60 percent of the money, and 40 percent invested in the renewal of the remote transport vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is now 19 years old.
However, modernized older vehicles are counted completely new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of vehicles were not calculated, the average age of driving ČD vehicles would be increased by ten years.
A little older are on average passenger cars whose average age at the start of modernization is 23 years.
The average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years if only age was taken into account from the date of production.
Classic sets consisting of wagons and locomotives, however, have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways in recent years and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015 the number of locomotives remained from 280 to 223 pieces, similarly the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in mid- this year.
In particular, the carrier got rid of old vehicles equipped with fur seats and doors without being able to block the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these vehicles scrapped.
For example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour planned by the carrier to place on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic speed track, is possible from the investments planned in the vehicle park in the near future.
The contract consists of up to 30 motor and 20 electric units.
The authorities of the fourth year know about illegal advertising, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely powerless, they admit.
For the fourth year of the online edition of the daily News News.cz has been watching the story of billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where not only is the tourist interesting walk in the tree crowns, but also the Olympic park.
The highway managers know they're standing there in black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds of like ads all over the country, maybe thousands.
According to officials, there's a law of shame that prevents illegal mobile billboards from being removed immediately.
The need is first a complex bureaucrat wheel.
In the meantime, the company will change its name and the office will be short on it.
Or maybe you just have to move the ad a few meters, and the official trial has to start over.
Roads and motorways managers admitted four months ago: at the main pull from České Budějovice, Lipno stands on our property near the state road advertising billboard in black.
Not even three months ago, the officials were not enough to get rid of unauthorized portable constructions with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one cares if they're standing right next to the road, in a 50-foot protection zone where nothing can happen for safety.
Road administrators say they can't simply deal with billboards because of the stupid law.
Maybe load it and take it away.
"We must not afford to do that," says spokesperson Nina Ledvinová, Road and Highway Directorate, and refers to a complex bureaucratic circle that the removal of billboard must be preceded by law.
The case of this particular billboard whose fate the online daily News has begun to monitor in detail in spring, but it is not unique and shows a general problem that cannot handle the state and the authorities effectively and quickly.
In the southern Bohemia alone, the editor calculated dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
Similarly, other regions are involved.
"We are having trouble for the company to remove the cords," confirmed the head of the Transport Department of the Czech-Budějovice Regional Office, Jiří Klasa, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to Klasa, there's a culprit law that binds officials.
First, he has to call the billboard owner in a difficult way to put the ad away.
However, corporate bosses are often inexpensive or they know a fin that has already been described in the past when the issue has become more of an interest: mobile stand with advertising is enough to move a few meters away and officials can throw the previous challenge to remove the black advertising into the trash.
That's because the Bureau has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and coordinates at once disagrees, it looks at it as a new device and we need to get to the owner again," explains Jiří Klasa.
A new law won't help.
The amendment could bring a new law, which will ban billboards on motorways from September next year, and will limit them to the I. class roads.
The critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same as before.
And the authorities won't be so relieved.
Companies can still make tens of hundreds of millions of crowns on the leases of illegal areas per year, and no one can afford them.
For example, billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Comerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: Czech-Udějovice Magistrate currently leads her three administrative proceedings for blackly built billboards.
The company is in danger of a 300-thousand fine in every proceeding.
These are more advertisements that have been placed in the class I protection zone without authorisation.
The management has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Morzaz, Head of the Transport Department of České popudějovice Magistrate.
Advertising, which is interested in Update.cz, although it is not yet established between these cases, will soon arrive at them.
According to ROSD spokesperson Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case would then reach the regional and then probably the magistrate officials.
Comerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't get in touch.
She doesn't receive the mail and the official residence on Žižkov cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the post office of the company was attended by a South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the trademark Hyde.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard leases the areas from Comerz Billboard and offers them to advertisers, but in the past refused any connection.
In the spring this year, when RSD started to be interested in advertising on Lipno at the initiative, Fischer had government officials send a letter to Commerz Billboard to his guesthouse, where allegedly the company is established.
However, no one has heard from this address to this day from the highway managers.
Bad fight.
Similar silence or opaque changes in mansions are not uncommon.
One company a few years ago, we gradually fined for two million crowns.
But she changed the name and the IČO and there was nothing to solve.
The case manager came back, the ads kept standing, maybe in other places.
We are very helpless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like a fight against windmills, admits on condition that one of the officials remain anonymous.
No one is addressing the amendment to the law in this regard yet.
Currently.cz spoke to several Members who were interested in the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, MPs appeared who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards at the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national, but also regional and municipal policies very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic.
On the one hand, they know about social demand for their limitations, on the other hand they need it for advertising in election campaigns.
I don't hold the rather established impression that when something doesn't work, it's necessary to change the laws.
This year, farmers harvest less grain, but more rape and poppy, estimated by the statistics.
According to estimates from the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet, this year’s crops exceed the average over the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, rape harvesting (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
This year, the harvest of cereals will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Farmers will reap 7.2 million tons of grain.
This results from an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office, according to the Czech Statistical Office, on 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a decimal drop against last year.
Last year's cereal harvest was above average.
This year's crops have exceeded the average over the last five to ten years.
On the contrary, this year the harvest of rape and poppy will be higher.
Crop growers collect 3.9% more than a year ago when they got 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year.
The expected decrease in cereals production is due both to a reduction in hectare yield to 3.71 tonnes per hectare and to a decrease in the area of seed.
This year, the farmers donated three percent less of the fields.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, will be collected by 3.3 percent this year, according to estimates.
Farmers put her in more fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed on the drop, which will fall to 6,04 tonnes.
Around a fifth drop in the statistics is expected in spring barley, which is most commonly used for the production of beer.
A 15.2 percent reduction in the area is worth reducing the crops, but also a lower hectare yield.
On the other hand, winter barley is born 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of rye will also grow.
Statistical rape crops estimate 1.305 million tonnes, which is more against last year.
In fact, the herbaceous areas have spread by 7.3 percent.
But the hectar yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rape crop exceeds a 10-year average of 13.3 percent and is planted on an area of one third larger than ten years ago.
The fields with poppy have also grown in the last four years.
He was sent this year to the farmers on 35.543 hectares.
In 2008, when poppy in the Czech Republic grew on record 70 000 hectares, it is half the field.
This year's poppy harvest will be richer thanks to the expansion of the landscaping areas.
He's going to be up by 2.5 percent last year to 27 423 tonnes.
But the hectar yield will be 6.1 per cent lower.
Loomous police officers accused two men of attacking with a knife and a machete, sent them into custody.
The police accused two attackers who attacked the center of Olomouc on Tuesday with a knife and a machete of a 35-year-old man.
"Although the assaulted tried to escape, they caused him a carnivore and cutting wound that required treatment in the hospital and other treatments," said Police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
Both perpetrators were arrested immediately after the attack by police.
The plaintiff filed a motion for the court to take them into custody, and the court satisfied him on Friday.
Both men are at risk of three to ten years in prison.
Police officers charged two arrested for assaulting a 35-year-old man in downtown Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The attackers caused him a carnage and a hemorrhage, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack preceded an incident between two groups of people, who happened to be in Freedom class on Tuesday at noon, the police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, informed the Olomouc police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
A huge fight between the two families took place in the garden space in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked using a knife and machete of a 35-year-old man.
Although an assaulted man tried to escape, he was caused by a carving and cutting wound that required treatment in the hospital and other treatments, she said to the police spokesperson.
In a struggle that raised great attention in the center of the city, and because of which several police guards and officers had to intervene on the scene, family disputes were involved.
Criminalists of a 40-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc accused him of trying to harm health and the market.
The prosecutor filed a motion for the court to take them into custody, and the court complied with him on Friday, completed the spokesperson.
The machete used attackers also in the center of Olomouc in a mass battle five years ago, it was then only a few dozen meters away, before Varna discotheque in Riegrova street.
The police then stated that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the company who were standing outside the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished the two attacking foreigner with a conditional sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around every day.
One of the most excruciating examples of the unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovatné náměstí.
She was supposed to be a hotel a long time ago.
But it's still nothing.
That you need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several houses which, despite their location, size and often also monumental protection, only empty and emptiness.
We selected properties in the center using the project Prybnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, of opaque relationships between companies, or of a state that can't or won't get rid of them.
Empty homes in the Czech Republic are more than homeless.
Whether the owners pay a special tax, they want an initiative

Clinton's husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
They put over a million dollars on Clinton's charity.
Most of the Clintons' income -- over six million dollars -- is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
The candidate for the US Democrats for the Presidential Office Hillary Clinton published her tax returns on Friday, increasing the pressure on her republican opponent Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year, announced the agency to AP.
Most of the Clinton revenue - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mainly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that the spouses of Clinton paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year and then a state and local income tax of 9 percent.
So they paid 43.2 percent of their income.
Trump, however, has a problem with a similar step; it has not yet decided to publish a tax return.
There's a possibility Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, and Clinton wrote on twitter a few minutes after she published her confession.
Clinton repeatedly returns to the secrets of Trump's income, inter alia, in order to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is truly as rich as she claims, the Agency has stated.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower salary would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.

In Nigeria, the polio broke out again.
Islamists from Boko Haram prevented consistent vaccination and killed doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of children's armor have re-emergenced.
In the northeastern part of the country, the government declared an emergency vaccination there, as two children infected with this disease were paralyzed.
The vaccines have taken helicopters there.
In the affected areas, Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram were working to defend vaccination and even kill doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) there was an unnoticed flow of the virus.
In the north-east of Nigeria, emergency vaccination of children against armor will begin because there were two children infected with this disease.
In Africa, it was last diagnosed in Somalia two years ago.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children will be vaccinated in the State of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP Agency, quickly transported small arms vaccines to the affected north-eastern part of the country, where Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that the virus had flown unnoticed for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram have prevented vaccination and have even killed doctors in the past.
Their attacks also made it impossible on Thursday to allow doctors to enter areas where children with armor were found.
The two affected children came with refugees from some Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for disposing of the polio Michel Zaffran station BBC said that vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
In the State of Born, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active.
The area was made available to international organisations and the government only at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken significantly in this part of the country.
The Nigerian Minister for Health Isaac Adevole admitted that the new cases of armor were a great disappointment for the country, because Nigeria wanted to announce that it had been wiped out next year.
WHO has pointed out that it is possible that although two years of illness did not appear, it still spread among children.
Children under five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, half of all cases of armor in the world appeared to Nigeria.
While in 1988, grain was still in 125 countries, it now only persists in three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with his former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to fallen women's stories.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from a gang of pimps.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look with confidence into the future.
František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against him by this meeting.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes in Rome who were released by the police from the power of a gang of pimps.
For more than an hour, the head of the Catholic Church listened to fallen women’s stories and then called on them to look confidently into the future, told the Vatican spokesman.
There were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them were subjected to violent physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
The visitor, Francis, wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against him, said the Pope’s spokesperson.
Francis often draws attention to the fate of people on the edge of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in Vatican this year in April and June due to his personal invitation.
France is going to hit the jihadi factory.
But without the help of Muslims, it can't be done.
In the fight against radical Islamism, France itself is to help Muslims.
Moreover, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing for major changes in the functioning of the mosques and spiritual education.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayers.
And the others will follow, the Minister of the Interior has announced.
There are over a hundred jihadites in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state to combat those who distort public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer houses.
At the same time, he wants to stop financing mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, most of them from Morocco, Algeria and the Persian Gulf countries.
That is why the mosques, who can sow radicalism in France, get into the mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister said.
The new French Islamic Foundation will be the key to meeting these goals.
It should work as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Islamic Foundation, established by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
The foundation should have already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institutions soon hit internal contradictions and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," said Valls recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate about a new institution that will replace the infunctional foundation has been set up.
Everything has been accelerated by other terrorist attacks in France, which have been carried out in the name of the Islamic State by the radicalized Islamists.
The French Home Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has recently heard that the new foundation will be established in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from home resources and also to oversee the Imams.
For the time being, it is not clear where it will take money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for different educational centres.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or a tax on halal food.
This is where salesmen would pay halal meals in practice for providing certification.
Some of this money would then go to the foundation's cash register.
The contribution of 10 to 20 Euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by the French pilgrims who will go to Mecca.
There are some 30,000 of them every year for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who went through special educational programs at French universities should operate in the mosques in the future.
This should ensure that preaching is in line with democracy.
Let's close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is in a campaign against radicals.
And others will follow, announced recently by the Home Secretary.
In France, there is no place for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, according to estimates, about 2500 mosques and prayers work.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have banished about 80 Imam, and in several other tens of them they are considering it.
Not everyone thinks that the government's actions can intervene significantly against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize do the same.
This does not happen in mosques, young people radicalize themselves on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Research Center.
Dragon Kelemen lost in the first round of sprint with star Bauge.
The procedure to the eight-final must be fought by a Czech race cyclist on repairs.
Dear cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Riu de Janeiro after the process of qualifying with sprint among the best eighteen lost in the 1st round a fight with French great Gregory Baugé, a silver defender from past games in London.
The procedure to the eight finals must be fought on repairs.
On the start of the royal discipline on the track there were 27 riders and the best Czech tracker of the present took the 14th best time.
Two flight starters in 9.969 seconds.
The fifth Baugé, who already has a bronze in the team sprint from Rio, was waiting for him in the main elimination phase.
Although Kelemen was reaching out to an experienced Frenchman, he took care of the procedure.
Well done, the lawyer of gold Jason Kenny flashed.
The eight-year-old Brit ran the third fastest two-hunt of history and won a 9.551 Olympic record.
It was easy, as expected, to deal with the last progressive German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet was also successful in a lineup with Bradley Wiggins, which took a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4 km racing race and advanced to the finals.
The British’s peak (3:51,659), which belonged four years after the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Push: They Want Fresh Wind in the Field
Representatives of young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their dispute for a new contract.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the entire board to support further branch actions at the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers failed to solve the questions about the treaty.
In July, young doctors and students of medicine voted to reject the contract agreed with BMA.
58% of its members participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday night on Twitter by JDC Ellen McCourt, the government stated that the government remained "quiet" on questions, which was the power to reject the contract.
She said: “In this light, the JDC Executive Authority by voting decided to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to ask for new formal negotiations on all issues.”
In response to government silence, the Executive Board of JDC today formally asked for a special meeting of the BMA Council with a view to approving the ongoing programme of successful sectoral actions from the beginning of September.
The dispute led a young doctor this year to publish up to six strikes, including the first general strikes in the history of NHS.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawan, resigned following a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
BMA members at meetings before voting before 54,000 young doctors and students of medicine said that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
Following the vote, the Minister of Health said that the treaty would have a burden on the medical community in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of "incompatibilities"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal termination of eight months of long vocabulary wars and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimír Putin welcomed the Turkish counterparty in the luxury hall of the palace in St Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more reconciliation.
There was a hand application, yes.
But Putin wasn't smiling, and it was barely the heat that radiated from him, even according to his measured standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Mr Putin, five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their level before the crisis, but would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent coolness that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: shooting down a Russian combat aircraft by Turkey at the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was fierce at the time.
Putin was handing out wounds around him, and Ankara accused him of sticking a knife in the back of Moscow.
It was much worse that he had come from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media has been running a massive campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly, it looked like the Turks were responsible for everything.
It was more important to charge the senior state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St Petersburg, the official message came that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some kind of victory.
The benefits of the announcement are clear for Ankara.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost deprived of power during the failed coup last month, and he needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey were visibly shaken.
There is also an economic motive.
The Russian sanctions had a hard impact - especially the abolition of charter flights, which each year carry several million Russian tourists on the coast of Turkey.
This figure has decreased by almost 90 %.
As far as Russia, the tour operators and charter companies are concerned, they will certainly take a breath if flights are reinstated.
They make money in Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey will be allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the News of Vedemość.
However, the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it considers to be a lame reaction to the attempt to revolutionize.
In addition, the long-lasting invulnerability of the lengthy talks about entry into the EU and Putin's accession - which desires to use and break the ties of Turkey with the West to cool down.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the elected authorities after attempting to knock.
You must understand that for Moscow, who has deep rooted fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this pumping, coastal palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to demonstrate what one analyst described as a "marriage incompatible": how they combine the forces of two countries that feel to be rejected and used by the West.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown each other reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on the opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even mentioned this question.
The Turkish President deliberately sought answers to the question of differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both countries could find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster, when a member of NATO Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft - it is certainly better that both leaders at least speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be repressed into the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
It was pouring out of them when it almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, they used “RCS” to protect other brands of consumer finances.
It was followed by millions of pounds of international sports sponsoring, from the Six Nations Ragby Championship to the Winbledom Champion Andy Marray.
Now, however, it has been decided that it is better to give more than stand out to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but it won't start any new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking that will get more at the forefront - Cutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our trip to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
“ The RBS brand will stop being our brand and brand for which our employees are working, because we are becoming a branding bank much more now, ” said St.BBC Scotland.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand and RBS.
Now I'm saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts to focus on the home scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our workers will work under these brands.
The RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring of the Six Nations Championship, it has prepared a profile of individual sports sponsoring brands.
“It is a good time for us to move on to the brand bank, because the basic question (which we are asking) is how do we focus on becoming a better customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we'd said we'd become a great customer bank and introduced the brands.
But with our focus on customer needs, and not on our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on the horse Predilition led to the goal of 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory in Newmarket brought him 3000 victories
Lucky Frankie Dettori secured the 3000th victory in the UK on Friday.
This milestone achieved its second victory of the evening on its local track - on the horse Predilation, trained by John Gosden.
Five-five-year-old Italy is the sixth jockey to achieve this result in plane races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple champion of Dettori, who had previously won the Ghayyar horse, said: “It’s strange.”
I'm very touched because my family is here, too.
I'm extremely glad this happened in Newmarket because that's where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not a Royal Ascot-- it's a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when, after winning, he brings Predition
Two jockeys of this milestone have reached in the obstacle races - the Richard Johnson jockey champion and the 20-time Sir Anthony McCoy pension champion, which, during his career, led the breaking records to the goal of over 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, 9-time Derby winner, 4 493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it's no surprise he's reached a milestone that only a few riders have achieved before him.
It's stylish and strong, but it's just his tactical fištrón, which distinguishes him from the other riders in the pond.
He is a fantastic racing ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he hadn't driven on weekends and big races, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is Frankie was riding winners in the UK for a greater part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He's a living character, which is good for British racing sport, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer jump
From the summer finals to the summer jumps - Frankie Dettori has been the messenger of the British flat races for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
A vast number of big race winners, including his famous "great seven" in Ascot, survived but also survived the plane crash and was banned from taking off due to drugs.
Three years ago he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a 6-month ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and doubters despite having returned in the best form.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has already stated that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released the president's office, Sergei Ivanova
Russian President Vladimir Putin had unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from the position of Head of the President's office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin declaration states that Putin “released Ivanov from his service the head of the Russian presidential office,” but there was no reason.
Anton Vajno, Ivanov's representative, will take his place since 2012.
Fourty-year-old War was previously a diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The Russian website states that later he was the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he was appointed to Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the Head of State within the meaning of the draft laws and to control the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin said on Friday the Russian television station said that Ivanov had asked him to be released from his post and recommended that he replace it with Vajno.
Can he convince smiles?
This step was completely mystified by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates and, like Putin, worked for KGB.
As chief of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was airing state television, both men declared that he was leaving the office of President at his own request.
But only a few people convinced the smiles of the cameras - above all right now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the consequence of some power struggle?
No one knows so far.
But the official claim that a man once thought of as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has encountered great distrust.
The Kremlin website quoted notes to Putin: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you to give me this very demanding post, even to say a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I've been head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up his post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin was in charge of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his representative.
When Putin joined power, he appointed Ivanov as one of his five closest associates.
At its time, it was even speculative that Ivanov could become the successor of Putin to the state after his second parliamentary term, because the third period would be counter-instrumentary for Putin.
This post, however, was taken over by another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister only three and a half years later before returning to the presidential office.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the criminal mind series, was released after he hit the director
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The television stations ABC and CBS that produce the series announced their release in a joint declaration.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before he was fired.
There have been creative differences on the stage and disagreements.
I'm sorry this happened," he said in his statement.
According to the ABC and CBS TV stations, the details of the way the Gibson character disappears from a series that follows the stories of the FBI's agent team a little later.
The four-year-old actor, famous for her major role in sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been on the show since the first series in 2005.
“I love the thoughts of a criminal, and I have given the heart and soul to them over the last twelve years,” Gibson said in his statement he issued on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to authors, producers, actors, our amazing team, and above all the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The return of the series to the 12th series is expected on September 28th.
In the city of Banff mysteriously landed in the garden of fish
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sand eels left behind by water.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters away from the sea, published a short film on the Periscope Canal of his finding, thinking that someone could help him explain how the fish got about five inches [5 cm] in his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge thus now connects with Fife.
This is the first of the four closures of the "crowing platforms" that are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the Fife bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
There are 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is the historic moment and symbolic moment of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnessing the use of more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the cap between the viaduct and the bridge of the delicate operation, which required exceptional precision.
In its place is now a total of over 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last parts of the platform is now casting in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to lift to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Designers project, said: “The first closure in the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this wonderful project, this cap represents the top of ground construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the North Tower expansion platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern proximity viaduct 700 millimetres southward.
This was a massive and very delicate operation at the same time.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes, and it was necessary to stretch with an increase of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team has worked with were very small - only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were flushed by water from their fishing ship near Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue ship stations announced an alarm on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the Moelfre incident crew saw.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued unrelentingly.
"We saw how their boat was around and we thought the worst of it," said the manager of the Moelfre Vince Jones rescue boat.
"The strong wind, fortunately, took him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men saved a local fishing boat, a third man aged 60 was found without a life vest exhausted as to how the fights were held.
They've all been beamed aboard a coastal lifeboat and taken back to the rescue ship station.
Jones said: “Three men being thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when there was a rollover.
Someone up there held a protective hand over those guys.
The judge refuses to solve a case for the Fatty's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three Members who, according to the prosecution, were to receive from Prime Minister Nečas and his former Head of the cabinet of Jana Nagyová's political impact, i.e. a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012 the tax package was approved.
Sniper, Fuksa, and the Dictionary have allowed him to resign with their resignations.
Then they appeared on influential posts in state firms.
That is why they also faced suspected bribes and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, the compensations totalled almost CZK 2 million.
The deaf man is now acting as a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building in the Fruit Market and solves civil disputes.
Yet, Judge Helena Kinga wants to be careful (the criminal justice case case - note red) and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be held in charge of another Prague court.
The king has released Jan Nečas twice, before Nagy.
It was an alleged abuse of military intelligence to follow Prime Minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
In this case, the Tombs didn't set up.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, it's just an overreaction.
I do not think that impartiality can be interpreted in such a way as to exclude a court if the Witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid it wouldn't be possible to judge anything at all, to write for a journal.
"It seems streety to me," he said.
Roman Boček, former official, is also charged with political hits.
According to his attorney, Peter Toman, however, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 discussed the prosecution of former Head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas Jana Nagyová (now Nečasová) and other accused in the case of abuse of the Military Intelligence.
Nečas and her husband are coming to court.
The deaf man was supposed to deal with Peroutk's statements.
For example, the emissary's wife was to judge President Milos Zeman's statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutek.
Zeman said he was sympathizing with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid of allied forces.
To Syria, along with her two equally old girlfriends, left Gatwick last February.
The British Ministry of the Interior did not comment on her death.
The young London women who fled their home were secretly transported to Syria through the Turkish border, according to the police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana headed for their other former classmate at the Bethnal Green Academy in London.
Last year, the case caused a huge wave of attention, as well as tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria so far, some 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for a hundred-thousand salary.
Great paid jobs you don't even need college for.
That's what the IT guy's job looks like at first sight.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only on the Czech condition extremely high salary (in Prague you will earn up to CZK 180,000 to work in IT), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
The most wanted are according to statistics of the staff agency Grafton programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
The candidates can choose between several job offers.
So they do not support candidates for a job, but jobs for candidates, comments by Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College isn't necessary.
Higher education is not a necessity for children.
Higher education is a good foundation and is the overall indicator of the intelligence and gradability of the candidate, but it often does not have much in common with knowledge of development.
Developers have to learn new things constantly, which will not be replaced by a college, says Petr Kubačka, Director of Monster Career CZ.
The most is made in Prague.
The wages of the soldiers are moving high above the Republic average.
They will come to the most money in Prague and Brno, and it is not such a hit parade in the regions.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
The highest profit will be made by the tech directors.
In Prague and Brno they can come for 120 000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions the salary is lower, but it does not fall below CZK 80 000.
IT project managers are also being asked.
On entry they can make 60 000 - 100 000 CZK.
Fighting is about graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, they don't apply to the A.I.s.
If companies are moved and overpaid by an expert from another company, they are happy to reach out to a graduate.
Because they can raise him according to their own.
They can't do without their tongues.
The knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, however, it is necessary to have good English at least for them.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is necessary for some ITs.
On the other hand, we meet a number of cases where companies are looking especially for a professional and experienced person and are content only with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a worker controls more foreign languages, it is interesting for his employer to serve more customers from different countries, the Director of Cuba adds.
Yeah, Google, there's paradise.
Only silently may Czech workers be envious of Google employees.
Of course, flexible working hours are for them, the possibility of working from home or various short hours, not just for moms.
"The company provides four weeks' leave after the birth of a child to the newly-cooked dads," says Martina Joneková, Google spokesperson.
The staff and family care, food, transport, training, wellness or massage at the workplace are also included.
Anyone who wants to be educated has a green light and doesn't care what new ones want to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
It's definitely not possible to throw away a free refrigerator like that.
Healthy lunch (in some localities as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microkitchens in every office where people always find a healthy snack, betrays speakers.
And in order for nothing to go away, what he doesn't eat, he puts in boxes that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these on the Czech ratios of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google to sit at the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, move or develop, ideas and innovative solutions," the spokesperson adds.
The UN has severely criticised Bulgaria for the criminalisation of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria of systematically violating the human rights of refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian Government "discretions serious concerns about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law", warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in the statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly worrying to be witnessing the importance and influence of public figures publicly expressing support for criminal armed combatants who carry out hunts on refugees at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who go to the Bulgarian territory in an irregular way are automatically arrested," he stressed.
And what's worse - often being prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite everyone's right to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria arrested 14 000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21 000.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
A number of people in the last decade have claimed that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer spending their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon removes people from sofas and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens originally died on TV, later on video games and most recently on smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
I am speaking of course of fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (it was later created a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, this has also occurred before the introduction of this new game at the beginning of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand there has been a decrease in interest.
It was then postponed in other countries because of the great interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go received more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as he has Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, smart phone players go out looking for Pokémons that follow GPS, and when they find them, they can "photo" (via screenshot on the phone) or "take".
Mania caught up with a generation that played the game at a younger age, picked her up from the seats and drove her out looking for Pokémony.
Thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that a "average" person will do every day.
The app Cardiogram for a smart watch from Apple, which is watching 35,000 users, recently reported for Washington Post that the number of people who have been watched every day jumped from 45 to 53 percent within two days of starting the game.
The company has no information about who Pokémon Go plays - only sees rough data about levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns to "find 30", "up from the couch" and "were active every day" fell on barren soil, because most of the public health messages are boring and addressed to people who do not look good.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in controlling weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot give the whole.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
So you cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight. And fun.
Some people even get new friends in pursuit of the Pokémon.
As is already the case, there are, of course, such boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can come into the door.
What, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their time, applications for smart phones, such as Fitbit, could follow our activity, but they didn't give us any reason to do anything like this in this game.
The novel looks and the interest in it will begin to fall at some point.
However, thanks to Pokémon's success, more games will appear that will combine apps and virtual reality with activities in the real world and help a number of people to pursue activity, health and a better form.

Simone Biles has won gold in her multi-threshold gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic for the jump.
No pressure on the hammer.
They were all lewd in the simplest.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the multi-fighting title and the others overcame the full line under the Olympic reflectors.
The total result 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead in front of the silver medalist and member of the team "final fives" by Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during the hammer performance in the finals of multiple sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Ria de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row that won a multi-fight, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation with the best gymnasts of her generation and perhaps the best at all.
When her overall final evaluation was on the board and her long journey until that moment ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her into the same league of rare athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has been dominant in her sport for the past three years, won 15 medals at world championships - including 10 gold champions. Her stunning ensembles are a mixture of ambitions and accuracy and the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The last test was waiting for her in Brazil, not even between Biles and the rest of the competitors, but between her alone and the burden of too much expectations.
Anything other than going home to your Spring family in Texas with the hands full of gold medals would be seen as disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), on the left, and Aly Raisman is engaged after winning the gold and silver medal in the female multi-fighting final at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in the Brazilian Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first Biles got Tuesday, when she was like a screamer in the celebration of Martha Karolyi's leaving national team coordinator.
Biles insists that she never looked ahead during her long trip to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her lineup in simple - the one that contains a typical triple flip-flop salto for her - is set in Latin music that could just fit home into the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a battalion, and her talent was discovered by the mother of Coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The contest has not been lost since the summer of 2013 - this is the end of a victory that can continue as long as Biles will want.
Even though Mustafin took over for a short lead with two turns, it was just an illusion.
The plain and simple - where Bilesa defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back to the front with 15,433 points per hammer - and finished with 15,933 points in straight.
Raisman gently hugged her when they waited for the final score - just the formality - and around the shiny red, white and blue shadows, tears appeared when the wishes that she once entered into her diary were fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she was sharing the third place with Mustafin, but then she had a bronze for the sum of the top three.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team that Americans call "Babycha" was way ahead.
After her simples, she sent a crowd of air kisses, capable of returning, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, she has a contribution that this 19-year-old athlete placed on Twitter this week, where she became a total hit, a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer case shot listening to music in a car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women died and a girl aged 12 during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix, were shot while they were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and the daughter of Ellis Maleah were shot in a car parked on the driveway on June 12.
The report states that an armed man stood on the passenger's side and fired eight shots from a handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, he's not worth a three-time robbery because the attacker didn't take his wallet, nor the $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
Phoenix Police spokesperson, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators are finding out if the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Hispanic districts, there were nine attacks in total within four months, in which seven people were killed and two others were injured.
“It’s happening in the residential district in front of houses”, said Howard earlier this month for the branch of KPHO station CBS.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were executed by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transferred to the hospital, where she later was injured.
Liner (31) and Ellis Maleah's daughter died on the scene.
A police witness said it wasn't unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities have also published a police report on the shooting, which has been the target of an empty shipment just half an hour before the murder of three times, and the police believe that its originator was this serial killer.
The investigators found the casings and the bullet residue in the seat, and they assembled a bullet from under the hood of the engine.
The mother of a six-year-old with a micro-cephalia: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciusto, like most of the children of his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, also his mother.
But unlike her peers, she suffers from microcephalies, which is the result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are prepared for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, learned that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people weren't doing this today," explains Picciut.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't sit or crawl, and he still doesn't talk.
Some of the milestones are already filling slowly.
He walks around with help and rides a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," she said to CBS News Picciut.
But it's not a common sign language - she says Edmund made up some characters himself.
Microcephalia can arise from a number of different states: genetics, such as Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
The symptoms and the prognosis may vary significantly.
It's too early to say what effect Zika will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciut recalls the emotional tax he's choosing on an uncertain future.
I keep asking myself: “What will happen next?
What's next?
And he's still not sure about that.
In fact, I never asked what the overall forecast was, because I don't expect anyone to tell me at all.
But Picciut has a encouraging message for the mothers of all children who suffer from congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
You know it's gonna be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rains and floods require rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Strong rain and extensive floods in Louisiana caused the governor to declare an emergency on Friday. In the state, more rains are expected on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) reported that after extreme lijacas, a number of rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and in the south-west Mississippi are pouring out of their shores and are threatened with extensive flooding.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that civil servants are constantly in contact with local authorities and the aid is already on the way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesperson of the governor for national security and preparedness for the crisis, said they were getting applications for vehicles for water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only Tangipah's district asked for ten thousand sand bags.
The flood patrols will remain in the majority of South Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service stated in the statement that it could rain more than 8 to 13 centimetres over the sea.
In southern Alabama, the flood patrol was on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of Mobile.
According to the forecast, the Comite rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are supposed to be climaxing on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of houses in the suburban area of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that the dangers are the floods of the Ascension district, where these distributed flows will only be slowly found in the Maurepas Lake.
The Tickfaw River, a little further south of the state border of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level of local time on Friday at 9 am.
The rescuers are still picking up people from floodwater in Amite and Wilkinson County in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step-son were previously among the saved at Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters away from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was warned by his next step son, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," said Hansford.
We had it all the way to the waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever experienced in a river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family members were disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that crisis workers saved all three huge military-style trucks and transferred them to a firehouse in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of heavy rains, floods “rather spread” and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer not far from Livinston reported that from midnight to Friday morning it fell 35 centimeters of rainfall.
Krautmann said the soil was heavily soaked from the center.
The authorities stated that the heavy rain and the paid journeys required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipaho County and the cancellation of teaching in five school districts.
The branch office of the CBS WWL station announced that 200 homes were flooded according to Tangipaho's elders.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which are both now flooded.
The mayor of the village of Robby Miller stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that had trapped high water.
In Amite and Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
“They will be able to return home when the water begins to prowl,” he said.
More than 20 streets were closed because of the flood, and locals received sandbags that could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had the last great floods here in March," said Lacy Landrum.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, the crisis manager at Harrison County, Mississippi, said that there was a persistent rain on the Gulf coast.
He said that a couple of houses were announced on Thursday, but none of them showed up on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot as a resolution", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, six-year-old boys were shot in Philadelphia, and this week it's a second shooting at a child aged six in the city.
His child's grandparents identified him as Mahai Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
My grandparents say that the boy suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including weakness, legs, arms and abdomen, but was conscious of transporting to the hospital.
"He took so much, his little body was shot to death," said his grandmother Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy's in critical condition at the hospital and he's undergoing several surgeries.
The family for the station said the boy should recover.
He was supposed to enter the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three more men were shot: two at 29 and one at 32.
One of the men aged 29 is critical, according to CBS Philadelphia, there are two more victims in stable condition.
According to the station's report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a ninety-nine-year-old man in critical condition.
Two more victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
The CBS Philadelphia investigators reported that there was probably a shooting between several armed men.
On the scene were found shells of a type of assault weapon belonging to various attack weapons.
Apparently, it was definitely a continuing battle.
There were shells on both sides of the pavement on the street.
So it seems that there were several armed fighters who were actively involved," said the captain of the Philadelphia Police Department of Anthony Ginaldi.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also provided.
No one's been arrested, and the police are reportedly investigating video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray missile on Tuesday outside the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's how I imagine a female gymnastics team for this year's Olympic Games, for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young color girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and the Catholic of Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also strengthened the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of this sport.
The number one gymnast in the past four years has been African-American.
Simone and Gabby were first and second last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the champion of the Olympic Games, and America exulted.
Now the world could be witnessing the incredible performance of the three-time world winner Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who showed unexpected but master gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American who won gold in the female multi-fighting of individuals.
And Aly Raisman, a member of the team, gained silver.
We're seeing a sport peak, but in gymnastics class in the country, it doesn't look like it.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie took the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five", because the team of gymnasts at the next Olympic Games will be composed only of four athletes, and this is the last year Martha Karolyi is training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnastics train mainly in private gymnastics clubs that keep parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for trainers and their trusts and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs gymnasts have all the trainings and for the gymnasts' and gymnasts' families it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring training gymnastics that are more accessible and accessible to communities of countless young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I founded the gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly black and Spanish) and we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of mind.
This combination means life benefits for good health, successes at school and at work.
The inspiration of this team will be to send thousands of young girls to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing "girl power" and winning the Olympic team gold, and thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to go on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter the next strike.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end their disagreement with the amendments, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the elections refused the contract.
Hunt revealed his plans to enforce the contract in July with the NHS being in "nobody's country" and the other delays would have a harmful impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend working procedures in order to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Committee for Young Doctors, stated last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labour crisis and therefore fair treatment of all doctors.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors go under a new contract, there is a need to make progress and there is time.
The BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through the negotiation met with the reluctance to involve Dr. and often with deafening silence by the government.
And that, despite Jeremy Hunt's promise from last month, is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push force and resolve the fears of young doctors."
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April there were almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits, as sisters and specialists were called to represent doctors among protesters.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would enter into disagreements regarding changes.
BMA wants higher work payments on a weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, president of NHS employers, called on young doctors not to enter any strike.
Mortimer said: “There will be little or nothing going on at all, but there will be pressure on the already overloaded teams and services, and there will be increased concern, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families. ”
Over the past two months, we have dealt with the advice of young doctors and together with the Ministry of Health and others we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informer.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as pressure, flexibility in training, further training for those who return after a break in their careers, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and gender pay differences - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
The cure for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that is around 60 crowns (two pounds) in the conversion.
Ticagrelor blood clotting reduces the risk of a seizure happening again in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now given after having had a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizures.
NHS watchdog NACE recommends that the medicine be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NACE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack or stroke each year, and a quarter of them suffer from a heart attack or stroke.
Heart and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which creates a coherent layer on the walls of the artery.
If this layer is severed, blood clots, blood blockages in the heart, and heart attack may occur.
If the clot relaxes, the bloodstream may continue to block the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by developing clots less likely.
It is recommended that patients be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the MICE Health Technology Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of repetition may have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
It is a pleasure for us to extend the treatment options available to many thousands of people who can benefit from Ticagrelor’s preliminary recommendation.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially about the danger of bleeding - is limited beyond three years, it is not recommended in the proposal for treatment over this period.
Computer culture began to flourish fraud in Muslim regions
The mayor of the town of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was called off last year due to corruption, which was linked to a government message.
The culture of political correctness has led to a overlookment of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, as stated today in the government report.
The ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticizes the police, the constituency inspectors and city halls for ignoring the abuse of voters because of "sensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption intervention, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should do cordons and guarded voters to protect them from the electoral rooms.
He recommended that voters take with them an I.D. and that they can prove who they are in the election.
At the moment, the voters have to state their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to apply indelible ink to the fingers of persons in the voting process to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have greater protection, says Pickles.
It calls for the press to have greater access to the documents from the meeting and to decisions taken by non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only about protection against electoral fraud, it is also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud that go hand in hand with it," he said.
The report requested Downing Street as a consequence of the Tower Hamlet electoral scandal in West London.
Last year, the special electoral court decided that the mayor-in-Office of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post following the charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The Court found that Rahman "cynically hit" the religious sense of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
According to Rahman, “he has conducted his campaign to be the religious duty of the Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes have been questioned or as a result of identity theft, when one votes, and it is out of someone else's hands.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern at the correspondence vote fraud - which is claimed that the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to vote for the candidates that they had elected.
Sir Eric, in a picture, gave several recommendations on how to clear the electoral system, including presentation of an I.D.
His report states: “It is evidence that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been put forward to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh. ”
"There was no fear that... the state institutions had closed their eyes to such behavior because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including that political activists should not be allowed to manipulate correspondence votes and thus prevent "enforcement of votes".
The report now evaluated by Theresa May also calls for more thorough controls on registrations in order to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and tax fraud.
Consider asking voters to present an ID before the vote.
Use indelible ink on the fingers of persons in voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they can vote.
Applications for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to three years.
Ban political agitators and activists to manipulate the correspondence voices and electoral envelopes they submit.
Getting the police permission to create cordon around the election rooms.
Change laws in order to make it easier to prosecute those who exert illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibition of taking photographs in election rooms.
Require that only the English (except Wales) work in the electoral rooms.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to the electoral booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it's "surprising" that after the Tower Hamlets case, no criminal charges were made.
"The election court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For many reasons he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the power of evidence of the crime.
It also criticises the inconsequential "checking of tick boxes" in the city hall registration departments.
Sir Eric said: “The decision of the court in the Tower Hamlets case last year will wake up.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the status of rejecting by some authorities threaten this reputation.
The madness of the cycling double duchess Kate and other doppelgangers of known personalities at the Olympics in Rio
The fans of the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 went mad this week in the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevotová, which is very much like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a twenty-four-year-old Olympic girl is not the only athlete seeking gold this year, which can boast of her own doubles of known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous personalities that are currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL female column has compiled a list of Olympics who are more than remotely similar to the Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted animal: A member of the American archer team Brady Ellison (left) was compared from a baby to Leonard DiCaprie
In addition to Kate's bicycle track, many people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be a twin of the star Leonard DiCaprio.
A racer from a team of American archers, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures, which apparently resemble a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed media madness and admitted that he had heard of his similarity with Leo since he was a little girl.
"He sees no great similarity himself, except the beards," said Brady for Huffington Post.
"He's a loser and he looks good, so I think he's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be stressed even more this year: a prominent resemblance between the British jumper to the distance of Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafin, with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Gell Matthew Morrison series for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan is an "athletic version" of an actor from the film Start (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Najna and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov is proud not only of the same as Annalynne McCord and Nathan Adrian from the United States team, the fans say he looks like a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Professional women: the star of Hope Sol (left) and the actress of Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape to the face and eyes
Not only one: The Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed similarities
On waves theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for similar consideration of pairs
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction at the website that “the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are truly identical.”
Hope Sol's football star and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter's actress are really incredibly similar to the shape of face and eyes.
Among other popular comparisons, Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medal holder for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, boasting with her beautiful wide smile, which is like copying Gabrielle Union's smile, Bravo stars, girls!
The commentator of the CBC Olympic Games is sorry about the Chinese swimmer saying that it "exploded"
The viewers of the Wednesday live live broadcast from the Olympic Games to the CBC station enraged the analysis of the performance of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's commentator Byron MacDonald.
The Canadian station CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “took up like a smell” during the race.
The commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when, at the end of the finals, the female staff on 4x200 meters freestyle began to churn his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "revival" to the CBC commentators' team, said, "That little 14-year-old woman from China gave up, you fool."
Too much excitement, stretching like a smell, blew up.
Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second race in 1:57.79 - that is, 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Chinese to reach out to China.
The audience in Canada began to speak quickly online and were horrified by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “Did the speaker at CBC declare that a 14-year-old swimmer from China “exploded"????
That idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan, from China, in the finals of the female relay race at 4x200 metres freestyle, was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's critique came from all sides on Twitter and many asked for his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn't stick back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon afterward, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for the live comment of MacDonald and said: “We apologize for the commentary on the performance of the swimmer who escaped to the broadcast.”
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we're sorry it happened."
Finally, the CBC station apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-consultator Scott Russel must have apologized on behalf of MacDonalda
The CBC then copied and put their apology into the reply for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the commentator MacDonald's comments
The station also quickly apologized and published a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, she wasn't supposed to get into the ether.
We apologized quickly to our audiences on the radio and to those watching us on social networks.
For the record, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer himself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron apologizes deeply for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live broadcast and tried to explain his comment by saying that he didn't want her to sound like a personal attack.
“I would now apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s staff,” he said on the broadcast from the Olympics to the CBC station.
"I had in mind the performance of a swimmer and not a swimmer like that."
"There is no need to say that I had no disrespect and I am very sorry."
Customers in the first-rate, degraded by a woman who was shamelessly trying her underwear in the middle of the store
When a woman dressed up to try her panties on the sales area in the middle of the first place, they weren't sure which way to look.
To make it worse, she tried her size, took off her panties and put them back in the shelf.
She continued to watch and finally tried four pairs of pants at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
A store at Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone, where a woman tried her panties before she put them back in the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at that time, said that a mysterious woman “dressed again after testing her underwear and came out of the store without buying anything. ”
She said: “People couldn’t believe their own eyes. ”
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, undressed her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
"She wasn't even trying to find a discreet place - she was just standing there, shuddering like a monkey."
"Everyone was just staring at her undressing panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back in the shelf."
She did the same thing with three more before she finally decided she didn't like it, she got dressed again and left.
"She seemed totally fine with who was watching, or thinking about the person who might buy the panties you were trying."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea that someone would take home the panties that someone else was wearing and no one would clean them up.
The event took place Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I collected things that she obviously tried to pull off the sale - which is also the only right thing to do. ”
"I would be terrified to bring new panties home and find out that they were wearing another woman, undressed them, and that they were not washed out."
“ The Prime Minister knows about the incident in our shop in Folkestone on Tuesday, 9 August, ” said the spokesperson.
All the products concerned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to defend yourself against attacking weapons with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it could be a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Krav Magic Federation based in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly win over the violent advantager, whether he approaches you from the front or from the back.
If he comes nearing you from the back, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a slow course of missiles".
Then you will grab a gun between your forearm and your shoulder just before you throw it into your face with a free elbow.
Then follow the knee into the weak, and while the attacker is writhing in the pain, you take the gun out of his hand, hit the main man in the face and you begin to retreat, while holding the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time put force into the weapon and strike the attacker into the chest, then twist the gun from its clasp and start retreating, still aim at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But don't forget, the safest way to get out of the robbery - if you're not the master of the Krav Maga - is to issue all the cash.
Traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe to travel guide
The British traveler has decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and gullible reflexes by licking the dirtyest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and travel author Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, for proof of the strength of his immune system, he licked a euro note with his tongue, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on the toilet in the train and a Russian public telephone.
Before licking each subject, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he's getting into.
The experiment based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the sink button on the train that used thousands of other people may seem totally repugnant, but maybe there are more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals throughout his travel across Europe about the strengthening of intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of what he licked left him in his mouth any worse than the flavor.
Ian Wright was famous for testing the resistance of his intestines to travel around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely - from public rails to train stations to remotes
In the film he made about it, he says: “I haven’t taken much care of my health since I was a child, and I’ve put everything I can into my mouth, from clay to eating worms and mud water. ”
In the film, he certainly confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused were dirty public bathrooms in Russia.
After a simple swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia refused to lick after his luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio shot the traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said: “This is almost the grossest thing I have ever felt in the toilet.”
Nothing dirtyer than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in cooperation with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
Mr Wright has provided Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid and vitamin C and D bacteria, which help people to strengthen the intestinal bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for refreshments, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would monitor the capture and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with "let's call Ian."
It is said that the interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of talking only about products, we wanted to put them into wider contexts - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this document we have provided consumers with more detailed information.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of what I wanted from him - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.”
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others were hard again.
I'm glad we filmed some of those dirty things licked."
In 2015, Valio carried out a survey whereby 84 percent of the respondents combined lactic acid bacteria primarily with the health of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent of the respondents indicated that at least occasional use of products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
The family needed before eviction destroyed the village building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of socially needed people left a damage of £50,000 on their municipal house after they were charged with terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their violent eviction from the house, housing cooperative officers were shocked to find out that the property was in an emergency.
There were holes in the walls, floor coverings were torn, garbage was rolling everywhere on the floor, and the walls were stifled.
The family has moved away and is considered to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, head of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about saving the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, as this property is likely to go into consciousness as a "not so good part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple have three sons who used to live in the house at times, and the police said that the terror that the family was working was street fights using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding population, drug use, distribution of drugs, and loud screams, fights and abuses.
Scheldon (47), whose name was mentioned in the lease contract, was given a punishment for antisocial behavior in June.
Several rooms in the house that may be demolished have found stinking garbage.
In a house from which drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn out.
The neighbors say they saw them on the street fighting, and people used to call the police on a regular basis.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner out of the house this week after they received an additional period of 11 weeks to move away voluntarily.
The neighbors who were relieved welcomed the eviction of their lives as living hell.
One of them said: “They did not care for anyone at all. ”
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times have we seen the police here, there's no counting at all.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a surveillance manager in Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, said the family couldn't work with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were regularly called to the house
Waste and old toys were laid in a hairy part of the village house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant has not been able to accept responsibility for her own behavior and behavior, and eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
There was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their actions according to the witness had to be spooked by her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team did, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community who bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time bear the message that we will not tolerate non-social behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenants who lived in the house at various times were about 20 years old.
The polluted mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after eviction
Workers will now have to remove piles of garbage left around the house
In 2014, she carried out a shelf in a house of raid and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of the class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for the foundation of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are considered to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth after eviction.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
The police say they're going to seek to evict tenants who break the rules of their lease contracts.
Angela Crow from Deno's and Cornwall police said that eviction was a message for other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
“This is a message to all those who think they can behave unpunishedly, and to those who would like to follow such behavior,” she said.
The Deno and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and non-social behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after a low flight of military jet aircraft over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun rays in the Portuguese Aveir were scared to death
The flight of the Portuguese military air force P-3C Orion flew through incredibly low
Military Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted that there was no safety hazard
As the low-flying jet endured over a crowded beach, the alarmed tourists were struck by panic.
The dramatic images show that the military aircraft is reaching almost at a touch from the sunny people on the sandy beach near Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists started to get up after they were disturbed by the noise of jet engines without seeing what would come out of the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the several recreationalists who released video recordings of the dramatic flight on social networks, said: “The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to collapse. ”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed and I really thought the plane would fall on my head. ”
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a low-fly plane appeared from darkness
The Portuguese military air force today declared that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify a fishing vessel off the coast and had to bear low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft supposedly flew a little lower than usual because of the poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, Air Force insists that the safety of people has not been compromised.
This summer, forest fires destroyed part of the land of Portugal and claimed four victims of lives on Madeira.
Portuguese military air force today declared that the pilot had to fly low because of dense fog and smoke from fires that prevented him from flying in the view
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels during training.
Half the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half of the funeral providers do not comply with the legislation.
Czech Trade Inspection (ČOI) found this out during the checks in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services do not most often inform the deceased of their prices or do not issue a written order receipt certificate.
The Czech Republic imposed 41 fines in total of CZK 73,000.
Her spokesperson, Jiří Fröhlich, informed about this today.
Inspectors found doubt at 47 out of 95 checks.
In addition to non-information about prices and missing confirmations, certain funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and one seller used an officially uncertified measuring device.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
It concerned urn packaging, candle covers and vases that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"As there is still a breach of the law in this specific field of services, control actions will continue in the next quarter of this year," said Fröhlich.
The London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said that the family learned about her death in Syrian Rakka a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian air attack in Raka, which is the bastion of a group in the country.
She was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she prepared to flee from the war of the affected country and return to Britain.
"Man wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - like a message and a warning to others that this is a real danger associated with the war zone - is that he will dissuade people from making decisions," Akunje said.
Sultan and two other schoolgirls from the eastern part of London joined in February 2015 on a plane to Turkey and then on the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultan family learned that she married an IS fighter in Syria and had been widowed in a few months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he will leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Head of the Senate for Democratic Party Harry Reid says she is convinced that the candidate for presidential elections for Democrats Hillary Clinton nominates Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in case of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, although President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The senator of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnel, says that the person who replaces the late judge of the Supreme Court will elect the future president.
Reid stated during a conference call on Thursday that he thought Clinton would choose Garland "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid's spokesperson later stated that he wasn't directly talking to Clinton about whether he was going to nominate Garland and that he was just speculating.
He valued Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to "throw up the ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is chairman of the D.C. federal appeal court.
Reid said that the Republicans who block Garland's appointment are "the minions" and "the poskoc" of the Republican candidate for the Presidential Office of Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't good for the office.
According to the Treats magazine, naked calendars are for "women and men"
Magazine Treasures works closely with photographer David Bellemer to issue a 2017 calendar inspired by the Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
But instead of exposed known personalities, NU Muses is trying to find another generation of top models for his calendar 2017.
President Treasures Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nudity is different from Playboy from the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Obviously, he believes the calendar is too.
“We need to go back to displaying timeless and classic nudity when women and men feel comfortable and get inspired by photos of women’s body,” Shaw said in his press release statement.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their pictures online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is the vinyl headed: who really buys turntables?
Vinyl loves middle-aged single men.
Before you decide to absorb the commentary section with the peppered notes under the pseudonym NoAllMethodlyManIn the Middle Ages, we point out that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so much debated resurrection of turntables is connected not to the boom of the millennials who want to love the original possession of a physical object, but with the nostalgia of middle-aged age.
Those who have recently bought a vinyl album are most likely to be people between 45 and 54 years old.
Young people aged 18-24 are least likely.
It's not really about accumulating an enthusiastic fan - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: the older people who buy turntables probably want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television report, I'd be followed by a camera going out into a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and I'd be supplicating, then I'd stop by, pull out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at it."
Let's take a look.
While the heart of Soho slowly runs out of its charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent sellers, they are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, connections and office needs - several fantastic specialized turntable shops remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while.
Stuart (55), a native from Glasgow, which I follow from Sister Ray (counts: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counts: eight middle-aged men, one female around 20) has a meeting in London this afternoon and is looking at the stores to fill out a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got about three or four thousand recordings.
All those tapes lined up the walls of his living room - in the picture upstairs (he sent me an e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles also has because it can afford it: it can now buy turntables that he couldn't afford when they were originally coming out, and he buys what he sold in his youth and he didn't even have an elevator.
“It’s very good of what I buy from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These are things that would be published when I was 11 or 12 then I was too small and I couldn’t buy them,” he says.
They agree that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves, adding: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
This is my sin.
Take (25) He works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new tide of people influenced by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old turntables back.
According to my interviews, the people of their collections were most likely to get rid of themselves between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who sold their turntables once and bought the CD now sell their CDs to buy their turntables back," he says.
This could explain a boom of turntable record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of turntables?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that you can find a pleasant association of people with similar thinking in music stores.
According to the Board, some older customers are particularly upset by the system of non-connected payments.
Some of the supporters of the turntables may feel busy in the digital world and have decided for the well-known environment to cover turntables, things that cause memories of peaceful adulthood.
"I think that filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort," he says.
I'm a collector myself, and I think so, and so do I.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" says a co-worker from a pile of turntables.
In April, the ICM survey revealed that almost 50 % of people who had bought vinyl album a month earlier had not listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of people in question who never use a turntable, while 7% of those who buy turntables have no turntables.
At this point in the report he probably seemed really concerned about going through a pile of compilation boss nova.
The aspect of "trophies" and recovery of interest is something that Jonny (42), who works at the Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently came in and said, "I don't have a turntable yet, but I want to buy a radiohead so that we can put it on the shelf," he says.
The percentage of such is not large, but it happens.
It's more of a product page than music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a gramofon."
These are younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for turntables, has much more diverse visitors at my arrival.
There's a couple of '70s, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the stores before - from speakers instead of pulling jazz the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly alone, but intimidating mental trauma is difficult to estimate when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) is a few minutes’ walk in Fopp and looks at various turntables at the discount.
She's one of those people who's more likely to look at the windows than to spend heat.
According to her words, she doesn't make much money, so it doesn't seem like she's collecting turntables.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that allegedly inspired a new generation of turntable lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I look like I'm very interested in girls in tight jeans and I'm watching a group of teenage girls just cramming around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and his daughter decide to buy Crosley's turntable.
On the left is a stairwell whose wall covers Adele’s turntables, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the foundation of any average collection of turntables.
No one looks at them - maybe because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's a pure "vinyl trick."
But since any attraction to him could mean more money to the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for others, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is probably more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where it spends the most for the most luxurious goods that vinyl is.
But while, according to my findings, youGov's results seem to be accurate - at least in the turntable stores, they don't take into account a large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who actually exist in the turntable stores and online forums.
These people are probably hard to work in schools or offices.
I'm sure he doesn't spend Thursday morning wandering around a turntable store on Berwick Street, going through the recordings and avoiding looking at a weird, 30-year-old fake TV moderator who's hiding behind the back of no-suspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - video report
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five meters
The court in France refused to break down trades at Jungle refugee camp
The court in France rejected the order of the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cutting, sell tea in temporary restaurants for 50 cents or basic meals for several euros.
The office of the Prefect in  yais argued that places must be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations in court have stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that free food, which offers state-supported associations and other groups, do not provide food supplement for growing numbers of refugees in camp.
Spacious temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille Court held that there was no legal basis to prevent 72 temporary stores from being held, but it stated that the protests of the Calais prefect are "explained".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much greater role than merely serving food to people who "live under extremely desperate conditions."
He said the premises provide a quiet place to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by demolice was the coffee shop at camp, Jungle Book Kids, operated by a nonprofit organization, offering 200 meals, English hours, and French hours and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable minors who were not accompanied by the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition for the protection of the children's cafe.
The Guardian received a letter saying that the closing down of the cafe “was a disaster for these children, one of which was only eight years old. ”
The Charity Organization Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after the steep increase of arrivals has increased to more than 9000 over the summer - which is the most so far in the entire period.
He thought he was dead.
The volleyballs of Ústí raise themselves.
"From March I have been able to train normally," he reported at the start of summer preparations in full force.
What were you doing?
I had a two-sided pulmonary embolism, and that's why I had heart problems.
Because when I was at the university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot for two years, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me. No one found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, and it's going to hurt all the time, especially when the weather changes or the weather changes.
But nothing that limits me, more like an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
I did.
I didn't know I had an embolism last year at the summer tournament in Woodens, and I couldn't even move there anymore.
I threw up blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, and I was five more days completely finished.
I really thought I was dead, even my girlfriend and my family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just gonna go up.
I know I've got some blood issues, I have to keep an eye on myself when I'm going somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Only last year when I wanted to return to Příbrami preparation, there were still problems with my heart.
Everything's fine now.
From March I prepared myself to be able to play again.
I'll knock, physically I'm better at it than I was before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm looking forward to it, the crew looks good, I know most guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
I hope we can sit down humanly, so it'll fit together.
Can you lift Ústí?
He had a reputation, but every season is different.
Brno was eight years ago, now it's second.
There's a new team in Ústí, there's only a few players left.
It was the last in the extralysis, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
Once we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see after the first round, who's gonna be a bum, we won't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's experienced and experienced a lot, he'll think about better than the last place.
But my coming here wasn't his thing, I made a deal earlier.
There were other trainers in the game, with one I'm a big friend, and it was agreed that it would work here.
I'm not gonna say a name.
In the end, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's trained a lot of decades, he's a good former player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to fight, and I like to get an opportunity on not such a top team.
I've been in Příbrami for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being on the sixth team because it starts with the bottom.
You mentioned to a stranger, he's already training Australian Boehm in Ústí.
What's he look like?
I happen to know him by chance, we played a band against each other in the universe.
And we've had a couple of conversations, sometimes we've been together after the games, so I know you and I.
We beat them 3-1 right at the start of the summer preparations in Ústí, soaked it.
He's got a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze are coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been writing to an American, he looks like a good guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted an American?
It felt like a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of a player he was, found some videos on the Internet, played them.
He seemed pretty cool, kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'll fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to the position of recording number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'm gonna be twenty-four and I'm not the kind of person to go change.
I'd rather be in the middle of the day, I'd rather be in charge of the team than be in charge of someone else.
I probably wouldn't want to play anymore if I were to be a second recorder and spend all that time on it. When things don't work out, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Half the year in Příbram, when it didn't go to Kust as a captain, hurt himself, then there were problems with the money, and he left.
Since then, we've been rising up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, to which I was raised, I changed the number one and the number two.
An excellent year was in Old Town, after which I had many offers and chose the Příbram.
That's where Budejovice wanted me, and I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The Phelps domain remains a short position.
"Being back on the winners and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," laughed Phelps and again had eyes full of tears.
His fiancée and mother rejoiced again in the auditorium, son Boomer this time quietly slept with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started swimming competitively, and in a few hours it'll be over, he said milk.
In the finals for Phelps, a silver Kosuke Hagino was almost two seconds behind.
Bronz won Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from the World Cup last year.
After Alu Oerter (discretion) and Carl Lewis (further) Michael Phelps is the third athlete who mastered the same discipline on four games in a row.
After most of the race, the Phelps were led by another American Ryan Lochte and domestic Thiago Perreira.
While the gold defense attorneys in the final skater's 50s set up for a crushing finish, they fell off the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the ceremony, he made his way to the finals of the 100-meter butterfly.
Even the compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the marking double, could not overshadow the legend - after a hundred won in Rio and twice the line.
In the finals, he left 37 hundred Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin behind, and the third one was Rus Evgeni Rylov.
While Murphy has only the fifth place from the 200th place from last year's world championship, in Rio he became the Marking King.
Larkina, who had the same doubled at last year's world championship, came down from the imaginary throne.
At the Olympics, he won the medal only now.
The Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel shared gold at the Kraulář's 100th.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal on these games, for Manuel the second one after silver from the staff.
The swimming gold won at OH as the first African-American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sports becomes love for them, and they get to where I am, said touched Manuel.
The third was the Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100-meter butterfly race in Rio in the world record and still has a silver from the Kraulářské důmovka.
Until 6th, Australian Cate Campbell's world record is over.
A two-to-a-half winner won the Japanese Rie Kanet, for which it is the first Olympic medal in the seventy-seven years.
It has no precious metal, nor from the World Cup, and its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia by Julia Jefimov, who, in spite of the doping past, faces the obscenity of viewers and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should answer these questions all the time.
I'm so tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
The right to take off in Rio managed only to the special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the game began.
They were looking into my appeal, and I won.
If anyone likes it or doesn't like it, whether she has any opinion, whether she's turning to arbitration, she's added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And the launch at midnight?
I don't remember.
The cheques had a strange day.
Only less than an hour before the game, they learned who they'd come up against.
They must have handled tactical preparation.
And then, in a non-conventional time, the game started on little court number one.
The first set didn't start well, then they got the lead of the opponents, but they couldn't handle the ending at 19:19.
In the second, they were clearly better and even, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
Above all, a number of broken services meant a loss of 10:15 and a farewell with the Olympic tournament.
"We may have defeated the Russians," said Hermann.
How would you rate the game?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start before I played, we got in the game beautifully.
At the end of the balloon, I lost the income I used to get used to.
We lost a hundred, which was key.
In the next set we boarded them with a view on the field, other defenses, and we press on the service.
There was a bad application in the tie-break, and that's where we took it this way.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat the Russians.
The damage to the beginning of the first set, that's where we got away.
We've been able to pull it off, but we've missed the points.
The second set was great, and in the third, he was deciding the service.
We made too many mistakes.
We donated five points to them, and we hesitated a lot about the five points.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the little yard number one?
Sluble: Similar to China in the side yard.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
There was one hour at night, there was no silence, there was music, there was nothing.
That was different from downtown.
We wouldn't choose such terms, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the game when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was special.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the anti-games, so we couldn't do tactical preparation for the rest of the teams.
But Simon ( Coach Nausch) prepared a tactic of almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactic papers ready, so on this side, we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember starting a game at midnight sometime?
I don't think so.
We played at 11 o'clock, but not at 12 o'clock.
A block of Russian Birlov in the pre-school playoffs of OH in Rio.
Beach volleyballists Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in the pre-school playoffs at OH in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group since ten, we had the regime shifted earlier.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine another sport having athletes who have to give their best performance at 12 o'clock.
But I think we've done the best we can.
We knew it would be, but it's not very typical, and I don't think it's my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the procedure of the group was our target, it's all right on the one hand, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
I'm gonna sleep out of it, and from tomorrow I'm gonna remember the Olympic tournament in a positive way.
Big brother's here, here comes the first SIM.
You can't escape her.
The new rules are intended to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase an SIM of one of the local operators during their stay in Thailand.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or marry there.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting Office and the Telecommunications Commission Takorn Tantasith have informed that there will be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the National Telecommunications Regulator at the beginning of August.
New measures that will allow monitoring of their location will be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security that will enable the foreign nationals to deal with criminal activities.
Moreover, the so-called tourist SIMs have the help to detect people who exceed the authorised length of their stay.
A special SIM for foreigners should therefore appear alongside the SIM to the Thais only within six months.
Differentiality will be the function of monitoring, which will be permanently switched on at cards for designated persons without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to shut it down.
"This function is not in the SIM for the Thais, because we can always easily follow them," Tantasith added.
It is necessary to add that in Thailand there are no prepayments anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires an I.D.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators was handing out free starting SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand also considers ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore.
They are also currently subject to mandatory SIM registration, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the intended measure does not imply an obligation for foreigners to acquire a local operator when entering the country of SIM.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country concerned, after crossing the border, know only relevant network information after they have been logged in to their network.
They therefore know the telephone number, but not the information about the owner.
However, the difference between roaming prices and the rates of local operators is so limited that most tourists will start looking for local SIM during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to keep an eye on the movement of foreigners were legally subject to immediate criticism by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and compares the system to the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents in connection with privacy protection.
In addition, the police will need a court order if necessary to monitor a particular person.
Any abuse of the system will threaten an unidentified punishment.
"If the service provider follows SIM's location without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," added Tantasith.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While the number will now be recycled only after the 90-day period after which the SIM did not apply to the network, a new number could be restored after 15 days in the event of abandoning Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building on Vinohrady has a swimming pool and hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We've been looking for a carefree apartment where most of the care of real estate will be provided by the administrator.
The condition was plenty of parking spaces and elevators in the house, which basically disqualified older buildings.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with floor swinging, high energy performances and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which old construction is not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer and her colleague Kamila Poláková from Artiga.
Why did you approach them right now?
Would you recommend working with everyone's expert?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone, if they propose an apartment from the beginning, that this is a very comprehensive technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of a range of possible materials and based on the customer's wishes they are able to reconcile the interior appropriately.
We worked with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation from another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even in the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with the right background for a four-member family taken as a modern but not cold interior.
Priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with the terraces and implement intelligent household control.
And, of course, there was a need to keep up the quality of the design.
Did you leave everything on the experts, or did you interfere with the final form of the interior?
We have approved all the proposals, including technical drawings and material samples, but the proposal has always come from architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vysusil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, helped the architect to focus on our taste.
The combination of black, white and walnut wood was also an idea of architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc.
Did any complications arise in the implementation of which you had to give up your original ideas or, on the contrary, join the new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction at the moment when it was first possible to climb up to the height of our floor, and they found that the views we planned would actually shadow the surrounding building.
That's when we literally changed the layout overnight from scratch.
A gilt was used on the kitchen line and on the covering of the fireplace wall.
In the interior, wooden surfaces supplemented by the skin prevail, for example, on the upholstery of the food and bar chairs of Norma from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes here or is there something you would like to have today different?
I think it's a modern air interior that's primarily fulfilling its purpose.
We are not going to make any changes, most of the changes after moving in have taken place in the plane of shade and settlement of the terrace.
Perhaps the only insult is to the floor when walnut wood shows itself too delicate to the household with a dog.
The word architect, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to complete a completely new arrangement and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior is an important element of the location of the light pipes into the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet.
That got the daytime light into the darker space of the apartment.
Also direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the swimming pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
The pool and hot tub are also included.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where have you lived everywhere before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon, and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, and I got to work in one magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was starting to feel like I was choking in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere among people.
I thought every French guy was so negative.
People in France are negatively tuned in general, but things have been getting worse lately.
It's interesting that you're referring to negativeism.
For some people, this is how they evaluate the Czech nature.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people might not feel that way when they come to France because they don't see it as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
Money is a big topic.
People feel that they have little money, but the minimum wage in France is 15 hundred euros, which I think is enough.
There's also a problem with the behavior of people against Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, on the street where I lived, my Ne-Muslim neighbor started looking at me through his fingers just because I'm Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work practically anywhere else and I ran into an open spot with Air France here in Prague.
I'll admit, I didn't know anything from the beginning of Prague.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague at all.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or abuses, but I feel that people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress anything, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you uncomfortable, like when you have special clothes and stuff like that.
In Prague, I started to feel really free.
I don't think the Pragueers care about that kind of thing.
Where do you work now?
After a job in Air France, I worked for one travel site for a while.
Then my friend and I started a web site on which people offer and look for shared housing.
We are working only in Prague so far, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs in the middle, and two other friends of Bohemia.
I have to say that the other specificity of the Czechs is that at first they hold more distance.
He's not gonna let someone get to his body like that.
That's quite a difference from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses their faces.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you didn't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little in English, I don't need to learn a language that quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're Muslim?
Actually, no.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
There's one experience I can think of.
My boss, Czech, once told me about the French football team and she said something like, "They're not French, they're Africans."
That kind of touched me.
But if someone had a problem with me being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
And even though my colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstration.
He said not to go downtown, they're going to swear to me.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like this could happen in Paris, Nice or Brussels, too?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen anywhere these days.
Until recently, I may not have imagined that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur'an says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists get caught up in your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even if I'm not supposed to feel that way.
I'm trying not to keep track of the violence reports, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that isn't really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at Jiří from Poděbrad Square.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My associates, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religiously established than I am, so sometimes we have a pretty wild discussion about Islam, because we all feel a little different.
I come from France, so I went through another education, like Islam was taught at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
Sometimes Islam is associated with a woman's subordinate position.
How do you feel?
I don't think I'm under any circumstances.
Rather the contrary.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It also means you don't wear any headgear.
Hijab, for example?
And the way I was raised is what I signed up for.
For example, my mother is a fundamental Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It's up to everyone to interpret it.
When you read the Qur'an, you should make your own opinion of those things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur'an which says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, "I am not the wife of the Prophet, so why should I hide?"
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the scarfs require it, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
For now, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the perfect city for me.
The Czech Muslims and the Christians have demonstrated against violence.
The yacht of Kozelska Fencl's wind in Rio will fall on the steps.
Friday's trips to the sea in the Brazilian Riu de Janiero came out of the Czech yachter Veronica Kozelské Fenclová.
In Laser Radial class she moved before the final two races to the tenth place.
This would ensure that the Czech Republic participates in the final ride.
You collect packages like Pokémon.
They want to compete with transporters.
Behind the idea of using planned routes for the transport of consignments is TV director Matìj Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
The idea was to inhale the three applications with different geographical ranges.
We launched the National Transport app in May.
At this point there are thousands of cities recorded and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we first want to learn this before we focus more on abroad, says in an interview for iDNES.cz.
How will I transport the app work, and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data on how big a package you can transfer and how much you want for it.
Someone's coming back that day, like a demand for transport.
When the route and delivery time match, it pairs up, and both come with mutual notifications.
That's when the chat will open, where the couples will set up a transfer.
How many people do you think would have to register in order for each package to always find its courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't estimate how many registered and how many routes it takes to cover completely optimally, and every offer was associated with demand.
It's already working on the main tracks, and it's logically easier than on the road between villages.
The more people, the more potential of speed and accuracy.
So far, people build trust and find out that no one will run away with the package.
So you haven't had to deal with a case like this yet?
How many users have the service two months after launch?
At the moment, we have about 5 to 6,000 people who create paths.
We consider this a success, and we believe that others will pack up.
Doesn't it take too long for the sender to wait?
We hope that we will compete for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the matter, for example, on the same day and at a fraction of the price.
You'll be paying a few thousand for delivery in two hours from the big company.
You'll pay a hundred or less here, because that's the way someone's already doing.
Should traditional carriers in the future be worried about the potential loss of customers?
We hope that's the case.
The market has huge potential, with huge multinationals feeding around here, as well as the chain of business, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality does not match what they pay for.
Nobody wants to find a note in the mailbox saying they're supposed to pick up the package at the branch office first that day after 7:00.
By then, I needed a package for six hours and I waited home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't piss anyone off and send a signal to the competition, let them try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither of them has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matìj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which used already scheduled routes between world metropolises, especially aircraft.
In 2015 they commissioned a project to process a company that created applications for for for example MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of the year and placed the application on the market in March 2016.
Transport applications began to develop in December of last year and released this year in May.
This is the local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The application was developed by Mesík and Mesík Profi from this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The idea was to do all these applications from the start, which will one day connect into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to adapt the application and then more focus on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has been a topic lately, and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Aren't you worried about what's going on in an area that no one can say much about yet, where's the border of sharing and where the grey economies are?
It's the same thing, just another product.
We know that if it's successful and we go up there, we'll be the next thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even though someone saves and makes money, it's not the intention of circumventing the financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, either on the one hand or on the other, will be encouraged to tax his or her income if he or she makes a profit out of it.
What makes you think the service has such great potential?
The sender will save and the carrier will earn, and it will reduce the cost of travel.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
In times of social networks that divide people, we would like to see this brought closer.
Nice stories can arise, people are happy to help and tell each other about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys, or pills.
People in my opinion have been missing a personal approach for a long time, and we're saying that it's the service of people.
How, then, do you guarantee that the courier with the package will not flee?
Each user of the application, together with the registration, scans the identity card and indicates bank connections, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give man service and credibility.
The couriers also collect stars based on the ratings of the senders.
We offer insurance, we still load the details.
For an uninsured shipment in the event of loss or damage, the courier does not accept, under criminal law, responsibility for content if there is something illegal inside and he does not know.
If the police stop him and find himself in a closed package in his trunk, self-propelled or ten kilos of hashish, he's gonna be outlawed on the sender.
Is there no risk of abuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered if necessary, are the traceable administrative authority, which will be the only one to have access to it, and we are not able to see it ourselves, the data are against abuse protected.
How much money does a courier get after a successful delivery?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he's asking for.
The senders are charged several percent more for mediating contact.
This money is our gain, but it's only a few percent because we want to push the volume.
Also, no one can charge that they didn't deliver the package when they actually delivered it, the takeover and delivery are checked using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
In relation to the size or contents of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, small like a cube of butter, medium as a plate of eggs and big as a bass beer.
Then there's no more restrictions and if anyone has a seat in the car, they'll take over the fridge.
Plus, the sender has the opportunity to take pictures of the package in the app, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack the thing unless you want to hide the contents.
You're gonna put a forgotten shirt in the courier's hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to run the service?
A friend got the idea more than two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention at that time.
Then he showed me a demo app with a transnational range that focuses mainly on the passenger plane.
At that point, I told him I wouldn't be looking for an investor, but I'd like to become one myself and put in some savings.
The next year we have developed more than we have established in London the Shippansee LTD because of the greater reliability of the product.
But this isn't a version that you're focusing on right now.
No, marketing was focused on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to capture the app, because the whole thing had birth pain and there is still something to solve and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and the foreign market we are currently not dealing with as much.
We know it's a long run, but we don't wait, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way upgrade.
The transfer was created when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application Mesik is local for the city.
But it can send a package to the exact address and across the world.
It works for senders as well as the Transfer, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocation in your phone.
We called the Mesik Profi app for couriers who want to feed on it.
So someone can make money picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last application will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make a trip to work.
Like everybody's playing with the possums right now, they can pick this up exactly the same way.
You see where contracts are around town, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and takes the shipment.
It's set cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we are still doing a web interface that will be crucial for shipping companies, fill in data about them, or create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them each month.
Are you now dedicated to the project full-time?
It bothers us, but it's normal for us to work, so we can feed and develop the project.
There's not a strong multinational investor behind us, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other got into it with other stimuli and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to manage to encroach with us not on the Czech market, but who should, with the exception of the ball, go with us to the global product and become another huge player on the market such as AirBnB and Uber.
The story of Titanfall 2 is to bring nearly forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will, according to the first information, be more colorful than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filler will be based on the concept of a network bay in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, includes the possibility of using the fighting titanium.
In addition to the action passages, the game will include levels focused on skillful movement.
They'll be resemblances and resemblings.
For example, double jumps, run around walls and rope slides are essential to overcoming them.
In addition, sometimes enemies will need to be destroyed.
There will also be maps that resemble mazes and levels with special concepts.
For example, one way to lift up the platforms will be to close the huge doors.
So you're going to be in the form of a battlefield.
The pace of the game should therefore be oscillated between raging events and more peaceful moments to explore an unknown planet.
We're going to be Jack Cooper's pawn dreaming of a pilot's career.
At the start of the campaign, Cooper and Captain Lastimos will fail on the alien planet Typhon, occupied by enemy soldiers.
And he's not going to be a wild one.
In addition, in the event of an accident, Lastimos will suffer fatal wounds, and that is why Cooper will be tasked with operating the captain's titanium.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true before he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot's repair.
Cooper's calls to the Titan will be significant.
It will serve the players as a source of information about the soldier's past, but, at the same time, the robot isolated communication will create humorous moments.
For example, if the Titans are going to name all the injuries that would threaten Cooper in the planned jump.
The first campaign information at Titanfall 2 brought the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be evaluated in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impression of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is released on October 28th, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will come to life, but the original label remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the failure of the publisher THQ in 2013 won a number of his brands and the right to use the logo and company name.
Nordic issued for example the Darkiders 2 Death Edition or the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, 23 games are created for publishing, and 13 of them have not yet been discovered.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning-- obviously, first she tried it for a long time, then they got back together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, 'cause she used to date him in front of me.
She's totally crazy about him.
On the first days, she even changed her voice, had a girlly, in love with her voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I've been watching it all.
He then went out of work regularly at half past four, and so she always left at three for shopping.
Every day, she tried to make sure she could see him.
Later I found out they were meeting at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got the keys. He was determined I'd catch them there.
But I don't know why, in the end, I always stayed home.
I've never been able to go in there, take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife took control of me mentally.
Soon, I think she found out that I was cool enough to do what she wanted me to do.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a baby.
The neighbors then indicated to me that they knew that, too.
I was such a jerk, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all went down, it would be bad.
That it would fall into everyone's family, only a daughter suspected something.
So I've always put it aside, come on, come on.
But I went to his apartment once, said I needed some help in the laundry room.
He went in there with me, and I told him I got the anonymous, that he was seeing my wife, and that she suggested it all.
I asked him what he was gonna say.
He was standing there, shaking his shoulders, looking at the ground, and he didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife on the way out of the store at that time.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond, and she didn't tell me anything.
Nobody told me anything at the time.
I'm the kind of person who's never gone out much who has a hard time getting to meet someone, let alone find a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I was still counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all this, and life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've basically never dealt with all this.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her a lot earlier, but I finally gave it up for peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's busy.
I think she's always tried to make me have no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's a good girl.
But sometimes I want to pet her, hug her, and she won't let herself.
We take walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that he still loves him, he's her god.
And I don't like life like that.
When it started and I carried it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live and I asked her what she would say if I had finished it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
Following terrorist attacks, France is stepping up the fight against radical Islamists and the government is calling upon the local Muslim minority to help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who distort public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop financing mosques from abroad, when preachers are often coming with money to vaccinate jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Islamic Foundation, established by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
It should have already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, it was hit by internal conflicts, and it never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," said Valls.
The new foundation seems to be headed by former Home Secretary and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as the supporter of the secular state.
In France approximately 2500 mosques and prayers are active, some 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have banished about 80 Islamic clergy from the country, and they have been considering this step for several decades.
This week, German police also hit the jihadic clergy.
The Imams allegedly recruited fighters for the Islamic state.
One of them was operating an area where the believers allegedly radicalized themselves and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Right after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate about a new institution that will replace the non-functional foundation in France was set on fire.
Everything was accelerated by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of mosques from home resources and also to oversee the Imams.
However, it is not yet clear where it will obtain finance, even though several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, i.e. mainly for meat derived from slaughters under Islamic principles.
This tax would be paid in practice by the sellers of halal meals, namely for granting the authorisation.
Some of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
The contribution from EUR 10 to EUR 20 could also be paid by French pilgrims who are going to Mecca.
Every year, about 30 thousand of them leave France for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, only preachers who have passed through educational programs at the universities in France should operate in mosques.
This should keep their sermon in line with democracy.
The government also closes radical mosques.
"Since December we have closed 20 of them and the others will follow," said Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between men and women," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was badly injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at a shopping center in the north of Zaragoza, writes the Independent daily.
The shooting took place after the woman and daughter left the garage spaces in their car.
The man was waiting in the car before the shopping mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes the Independent.
My wife took an uninjured daughter to the hospital, and an ambulance had to come for a man in critical condition.
The crime took place around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous area of Aragonie, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press writes in the Independent that the motive was probably the recent divorce of both partners.
Soaps with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer wishes light, well digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so from the summer gardens smells of grilled crayons, buns, pork wraps.
Not very healthy, not very light, not so often with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
True, grilling is time-saving and dish-saving, and it's a social matter and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to making a good taste, which special dining, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or choke.
And they will contribute to our health.
Whether it's a homemade sushi or a sashimi, where quality raw materials and a few well-inflicted Griffs are enough to prepare them for fun and food itself is a true exotic delicacy.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, even more time-consuming cooking and chilling rice is falling apart.
The paper can only be softened for a moment and then it depends only on the cook's fantasy of how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
There's no algae like algae.
Today, the advantage of a number of Asian cuisines is that raw materials are usually available.
Including sweet-acid ginger, which is one of the basic flavors accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the true pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it blends from several kinds of vinegar and ginger.
So just buy a bag of appropriate size, and the annex with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion as well as resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Bacon leaves.
They are used mainly in Buddhist and Hindu cultures for serving and decorating dishes within various celebrations and rituals.
The long ribbed leaves of banana are very widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America as well as "help" for the preparation of various baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed in them as well as in alobal.
The banana leaf then gives the food a specific flavor.
In our country you can buy in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
But select only leaves of green, and therefore healthy, unspoiled and spotless.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare an algae salad wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be bought frozen again.
Who often eats or prepares sushi, will probably know in particular the algae of the burrow.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called leaves of the so-called standards – that is, sheets intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame - dark green algae growing in the waters around Hokkaidó - it is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the algae of the burrow.
By the way, who doesn't know the bowl of soup with the wakame, supposedly Asian women use it to recover from birth.
And this algae has almost miraculous effects.
Cleans blood, strengthens blood circulation, even allegedly prevents hair greying and is literally charged with mineral substances.
The dried and crushed wakame also serves as spices, for example, to season rice.
First, the fresh algae are allowed to be removed in the water, then washed, put into boiling water and cook for half a minute.
Then it cools down in the ice water, cuts out the middle ribs, and further adjusts, like a favorite salad.
But buying it already done, frozen, is the simplest solution.
So it is only left to motivate a roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a bomb of longevity.
If you resist and don't throw in a grilled bun.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have interesting fresh food, which deliciously combines flavors.
And it's done once.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrot, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green asparagus, 60 g of salad cucumbers, 60 g of algae wakame and 60 g of sweet chili sauces.
Crissacked coriander, spoon of black sesame, spoon of srira chili sauce, 20 g manga and 40 g pickled gari ginger, a bit of pine nuts.
First, let's get the coils ready.
We'll soak rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we'll take it out and wait until it's soft.
In the meantime, in hot water, we'll cook the baptismal shoots shortly, about three minutes later, we'll let them cool down quickly into the ice water so they don't lose the color.
We'll put a vegetable filling on the paper and wrap it up.
We will prepare the filling with white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, which we cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add a chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put them on rice paper.
We're going to put root shoots on the banana leaf, add rolls, and we're going to decorate the whole dish with an algae wakame, a pickled ginger, a slice of mango, we're going to spray it with a black sesame, and we're going to add a couple of pinio nuts.
Britain has to settle for silver in the seven-point rugby, Fiji's selection takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in the seven-legged ragby ended with a devastating lead on the final obstacle, Fiji defeated 43:7.
The Fijians presented a master's lesson in processing, landfill, folds, support game, run on rope and brutal forces - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unscrupulous prize of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third time on that day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of the 7th Rugby, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The victory over the South Africans 7:5 in the semifinals of the same day may be frozen in the finals.
However, Fiji would beat the 15-member team in full health in its own form.
You can't say it to the British, but they may be happy that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their necks tomorrow: Ben Ryan is the head coach of the Fijians, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has offended a piece of the way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every match in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, the British penetrations reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates it was like running behind a series of buses in motion and World Cup champions led 5:0, when Osea Kolinisau came out from behind the corner.
The timer showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing of the conversion.
12:0 and Britain has hardly touched the ball.
A great Mitchel tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from score for the third time, but only the Fijians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarava added another one on his return, and there was still more than 1 minute left... of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated the tiny British and hit the line where he scored.
After conversion to 29:0 the break followed.
It was like Fiji was born to ragby 7s while the British were still learning how to pass.
That's how it is.
After half-life, the British made mass changes, and the Fijians stopped... for four whole minutes, which was good, compared to the first half, until after the brilliant interplay of Fiji, Josua Tuisova penetrated.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, tossed a touchdown into the left corner to raise an 36:7. But the match was long ago won by the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans singing at the cheers, waved and danced.
It was hard not to admire the totally joyous attitude of the Fijians.
At the final moments, Mata Viliame, further attempts to weaken the Fijian victory.
The whistles came in, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn of the low.
Even before that day, Fiji in the semi-final defeated Japan 20:5 and the United Kingdom conquered South Africa in a close semi-final - the difference between one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half-time to lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling leg work, broke through a defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
The great late-night dump of Marcus Watson, brother Anthony of the 15th team of England, secured a victory - and, finally, a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the coach to fight cancer to win the rowing race.
You won't find more emotional gold on these Peas, and that's what you'll say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing breaths into history Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance at their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
While two were sitting at the wedding, there were three voices in the boat, when the ship rolled at the level to meet the second Olympic gold behind it in the female pair race, there was still a voice with them in the boat of the still present coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their advantage was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes, how they fly after water level with the elegance of the swans - does not reflect the nature of victory completely.
For each gold medal of rowing there is a battalion of auxiliary hands, which by bit mean a difference, and no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who didn't know 30 months ago whether he would live to see that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his words, it was uncertain.
I suffered cancer from a bladder that can be operated, and I've undergone this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's going to change your view of things.
Cancer was detected to Williams in December 2013.
Happiness for the whole trio was that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and so reduce the decline to a minimum - if we can call it that in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get back together fast.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked in the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet, when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
The rowing itself is the way, but this was a little more difficult.
Immediately after winning, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to handle his own unrest.
Stanning, captain of the Regiment of the Royal Artillery, having a mission in Aghanistan, said: “This week I was down with my emotions, it may be a little extreme, but it means so much.”
Again, it emphasizes how much this means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and so did Robin.
Up until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he's one of the biggest thanks, he's the greatest coach in the world.
I couldn't wish for a better person for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose one race in five years.
The couple put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn't match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crew from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
At the very moment, we were focused.
Helen was like, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't want to achieve anything famous.
We weren't looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to cheer up, go out and win the race, which we did.
A couple take a year to think about it before they decide what's next.
Glover is getting married next week, and her future TV adventurer is Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
London took about six months to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it," she said.

Prison?
Rather, let the people carry free, says the Cabimafie Rubesh to break the charges.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate in Prague are, as stated by ČT, accused.
You've made a number of reports that reveal the fraudulent practices of even those who are to be in a group that will appear in court.
You've faced a few unpleasant fights with exposed actors.
How much is your report on the prosecution of members of the organised group broken down?
I was expecting some kind of trial to happen.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
That's useless.
Mostly they should return all the stolen money.
And they should put them back in a way they'll be carrying all the people for free.
That's a rather unique solution.
Does this mean, then, that you do not view any punishment as sufficiently effective?
It's enough for me that some of them are so afraid they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a pingle, another unties a pizza, and one of them totally bailed out.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Is that, in your opinion, an adequate rate?
I generally have a problem with the removal of freedom.
I find that a bad punishment.
To put someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should restore the company they took from her.
For the fourth century, they have committed destruction of our country’s name, and they have been stealing from people.
So let's get them to do a good card now and get people out of here for free.
I can't imagine it any different.
It would work like a community service.
As someone comes to collect garbage, they would get a car and take people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get parole after all, and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and then at Tomáš Bati University in Zlin.
They belong to people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the website in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of shows, now he is preparing the Prague Guide programme, which is intended primarily for foreign audiences.
Rubesh, in the form of short reports, advises what services it prefers to avoid in Prague and what it recommends to use without fear.
Previously he filmed a series with names How to, City of Cheats?, Life in luxury, and enough! and Prague vs. Dusts.
In the prosecution, they are referred to as an organized group.
The police've been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be referred to as mob?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from Godfather.
It's more about mobs - juniors, but they're organized for sure.
Only when they guard each other's relays.
Prague is all distracted.
I have seen that, for example, the main railway station does not like Paris, Paris does not like the taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Vary (disco club)
Everyone's just looking out for their place, and every group's sort of organized.
It's probably a complex network.
But the defendants are only seven people, six taxi drivers, and one former magistrate who warned the driver about the checks.
As you say, the side effects on the streets didn't disappear.
What percentage of Prague taxi cheats is your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst on the street are still there.
For example, I'm talking about Aleš Ryyák.
This is a person who is really dangerous - a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday stands by Charles Bridge and the people.
The last time I went with him, he asked me for seven hundred miles.
His police didn't stop him for a reason.
They only picked a few people from the whole big group.
However, the same is true in other locations in Prague.
So it is difficult for seven people to wipe out the famous Prague rite, which seems to have much bigger dimensions.
Of course, it's no use at all.
It'll help, but all evil doesn't wash away, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still perform at the same places you showed in the reports, namely the Charles Bridge or Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day, and they break the decrees every day.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague Magistrate.
It's not even a cat anymore, it's a total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even though they are part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's already a breakthrough.
I must therefore ask, Do you feel satisfied?
If I thought it satisfied, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is, and will always be, to improve the centre of Prague.
And even if I feel like I need to get a little better, I'll continue to do so.
You need to push the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But it's not, of course there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them in the cabs?
Sometimes I do test-drives, and I have to say, it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 kroner for three kilometers, although he then claimed it was 56 kroner (he used a decimal line trick).
He had a receipt, the cops came in, and this cab driver was so cute, he was still going to see the cops and he asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the cabameter glued a decimal and robbed tourists of 357 crowns.
Is it to be said that the rudeness of fraudulent taxi drivers did not retreat even after you showed the faces of those who charged pointless amounts for a short drive?
Their insolence is still incredible.
How'd that cab driver turn out to be 56 crowns?
The police sent him away with the fact that they couldn't discuss him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And that will, I think, be the problem in that court (six taximen and one ex-official).
On the one hand, there's gonna be a cab driver with his receipts on the other side of the police.
But according to the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate may not use the secret recordings of the taxi service vehicle as evidence in the court.
When I was filming parts of their scams, the taxi drivers made me aware of this precedent.
I'm the one who always wanted to use the footage for the story.
Are you concerned that this fact might protect them from trial?
I hope every judge will understand that no cab driver could ride six or ten crowns per kilometre because he wouldn't be able to eat it.
You were talking about a shirt with a decimal line that underwater taxi drivers are moving in front of foreign clients.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they concerned about this job after the publication of your reports continue to use?
I think we've been popularizing this trick by broadcasting the show.
I was driving a cab driver recently, bragging about him being the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed that a black cardboard was attached to the side of the taxameter.
When I asked him what he had there, he said to me, "You know what it is."
When fines didn't work too well on a taxi driver, can court with their colleagues impress them with caution?
Is there anything that can dissuade them from fraud?
You said they'd always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can dissuade them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight more to get them out of there seriously.
I must say from my experience that the fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately predominant.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have taste, but they miss um.
He doesn't know much about it, and he can't say exactly what they want to say.
When they organized the demonstration (because of a proposal for comprehensive restrictions coming from Mayor Adriana Krnáčová's office), it did not sound very clearly what they wanted.
They once said they didn't test against Uber that they just wanted to have the same conditions as they had, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
The thing is, they just blocked Prague and created the best maybe Uber commercials.
How do you evaluate the approach of Prague Master's approach to solving the problem of overlapping?
It's obvious that she had to get into it with the criminal police to figure something out.
The magnet was short for it.
They had a mole in there that was leaking information, which means the taxi department was doing its job for years completely unnecessary.
I hope the official will charge for the last check on all the mischecked checks to see what he's done.
That's the worst thing I can think of.
I was even with him on one of the controls, which I found out later on from their schedule.
It's been a few months since the last edition of the series.
What's the response?
I'm thinking mainly of foreign viewers, before the series is actually the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I give them the videos.
And then when we're going to the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people there that can see them on the shots are really standing.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd put a can of people around them to look at them.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi if you need to?
Sure.
I drive services that I don't have to pay cash for, but a card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are a lot of dispatches that are fair.
I only took a cab on the street once in a while.
The driver said to me when he got in the car, "Now, you have the courage."
Be dressed as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were already written in 2005.
In the same year, former mayor Pavel Bém went on a check-drive in disguise as an Italian tourist, and immediately at the first attempt, the driver tricked him by two hundred.
Editor Rubesh has had worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him for driving from the Old Town Square to the Wenceslas Square CZK 820, which is worth approximately CZK 195 per kilometre, as reported by reporters.
The Prague Magistrate fixed a maximum price of CZK 28 per kilometre.
In the recorded report there are also other surprising figures: for example, a two-mile journey from the street of Paris to Truhlář was costing tourists 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For driving to the Angel, which is 2.5 kilometers, they charge, for example, six hundred crowns.
The marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
Its impurities go well, although sometimes dirt must be put down by scalpel, it has to be carved out of the folds.
It's not easy, and it's not fast enough, the restorer Vanesa Trost from Oldřichov, Hájích, approached her work.
Hat down in front of it: the tomb is built by polishing, after which it is necessary to climb many times and again to climb.
"The restauranter should be careful, patient and inexpensive in the working environment," she said.
In Frýdlantland, it's not nearly her first restoration job.
Thanks to it, the stone elements of the façade were restored in the back of the Frýdlant Town Hall, the statues of St.Mary Magdalena in Zatiša, St. Jan Nepomucké in Frýdlanta, Pietu in Frýdlantská Okružní Street, Mariánské Column in Frýdlant and the Atlantic in the front of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
With the restoration of Melchior, Kryštofa and Kateřina of Redern, Frýdlant started in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements from the load of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts will be ensured against falling and shifting; either they will anchor into the wall or to each other.
The treatment and conservation of the surface also awaits them.
The texts on the tomb will be golded again.
"Then it will begin by gilding inscriptions on marble boards with pure sliced gold," said the referent of the State Monumental Care of the City Office in Frýdlant Věra Sobotová.
There's no record of the tomb going through any repairs in the past.
At a closer glance, they'll take holes, drilled in marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old, and they're leftovers after the gravestone decoration.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately after the Swedish invasion in the Thirty Years War, everything disappeared.
Literally, the headlines have been cleaned, noted by Sobota.
In the church, the finding of the Holy Cross is a restaurant with a mild exaggeration like at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to fix the tombstones that were under water, to restore the christening, wall paintings in the tomb, and now the tomb.
"We would also like to go to vitrate in the future," said Sobota.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, we put money into maintenance and repairs every year.
The restaurator's work on the restoration of the Redernova tomb will come to a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They will be covered by subsidies, the city will not deposit any of its money into this part of the recovery.
A hundred thousand crowns will go from winning in the regional round of the historical city of 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is a contribution from the Ministry of Culture, specified Mayor Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The Council decided to release the prize to restore the tomb.
Experts' views on future developments in selected foreign markets followed by indices and comparisons with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one month and a half year.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The American S&P500 index, which has been going through 12% of the corrections in February, is now at a new historical peak and has already registered 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
Thus, the iron rule is reaffirmed that long-term traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which have, in the end, always achieved their own.
In a situation where U.S. shares at the historical maximum are thus disappearing again, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets were satisfied and fearlessly growing due to the quantitative release of the US central bank and, as today, the volatility index (VIX) remained stable below 12 percent.
And don't.
Although the Fed markets continue to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week, the Bank of England has also attached its hand to the work, which will purchase bonds of £70 billion in the next six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative release is pushing so much lower yields even below and contributes to the almost complete elimination of the risk and fear of the future.
How long will this state last?
That's a million-dollar question, of course.
However, there are no risks at present, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without greater fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market, and China is stabilizing, and there is essentially no longer a theme, so we should probably not be too surprised if US shares continue in a similar calm regime.
It's too bad Juncker's not studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier accepted this important and demanding task.
I wanted this difficult work of an experienced policy, said the head of the European Commission Juncker, when French policy (really experienced, because the so many various transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would find it difficult to find) appointed the main negotiator of the European Commission the conditions for the departure of Great Britain from the EU.
Juncker's selection inflated the hopes that it is in the EU's serious interest to seek the form of a future friendly coexistence with Britain.
But most of the British media accepted Barnier's name as the Juncker War Act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
He hates the Great Britain.
As the Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for reforming European banking law.
He took it as he could only capture it: the hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
The advocate of multilateral regulation was a co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union, and is concerned with everything that comes from the City Financial Centre of London, he passed legislation overly hard regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, a representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a hard, relentless and probably even a reckless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How can we not remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance sheet, overview and ability of Prime Minister Klaus' empathy contributed?
Therefore, today the Czechs and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies.
Too bad Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this -.
It'd be good for everyone!
An earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin released his loved one Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from the position of Head of the President's office on Friday.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
She informed the Russian media about this appeal to the Kremlin press release.
Putin indicated that he had released Ivan's release at his own request.
During the meeting, which was broadcast by the TV station Rossija 24, the president said that he was coming to meet Ivan's wishes when he joined the office that he wanted to be the Head of the President's office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the President's administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's representative Vajno, is considered to be quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63 years old, is referred to as one of Putin's closest associates.
In the past, for example, this former KGB officer held the duties of Minister of Defence and Vice-President of the Government.
He will now leave the chair of a member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov, in his meeting with Putin, said that he was actually a record holder at the head of the state administration.
He lasted four years and eight months.
In this connection, he recalled that 11 people had already replaced in 25 years since its establishment.
Not even my Uncle and Safář's debut will play the finals.
So far, not one of the Friday tennis games has been able to turn into a final.
Petra Kvitová was the first to lose her fight, which led to Puerto Rican surprise Monica Puig after set 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitová followed the Czech debut with Strycová after a while.
In the first set, the Williams’ Slayers were reaching for the win, but they wasted two hundred and eventually the Russians got a set in a shortened game.
The second hundred then lost the ratio of 4:6.
Half the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: Skifar Ondøej Synek won his semi-finals with an overview when the other Damir Martin from Croatia defeated almost a second in spite of his vacancy.
Good night, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, said Son.
It was his opponents who, unlike him, had to fight for progress.
So it took some strength away from them, so it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing my cards, said the rower of Prague Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková didn't walk in Snykov's footsteps.
The five-year rower took fourth place in today's semi-finals and is due to start in the B finals on Saturday and fight for 7th to 12th place.
They don't defend the gold from London like that.
I didn't get to the finals for the first time at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I took a high-quality race and put everything I could into it.
Soupers were just better, and Topinková Knapková leaned in front of them.
She fought until the end and believed that she would make it to her fourth games between the elite six.
The fight gave up just before the target.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could get out of the field.
I was surprised to see the Chinese woman had such a finish.
And I thought I could advance to the finale through Austrian.
Unfortunately, today was the race of life, she told the 2011 World Champion.
Far behind the final gates of Rio, there was a young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who could not get away with the qualification for the second time, this time a little girl lying down.
In it, Nejchal took 33rd place.
Qualification's best worked out for the Russians.
From the first line Sergey Kamenskij with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Neikhal's shot was 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke to the program in Rio for the first time, among them Czech seven-slayer Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachová belongs after the second competition of the Olympics 11th place, Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is 22nd.
She runs Britka Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to an altitude of 198 centimeters, as well as the second Belgian Nafissata Thiam.
Both took care of the historically best altitude performance within the seven-fight.
They tried to jump another 201 centimeters, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look at the absurdity of the questions raised like this: The German society has gone through deep reflection, while Russian does not.
In both great Euro-Asian nations there were dictators in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible came to power.
The Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 contributed to the 94 million victims of communism, as stated by the Black Book of Communism, whether it was a daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent war leadership or inhuman experiments.
In a non-human way, the Nazis destroyed about 6 million Jews and the total victims of World War II are estimated to be 60 million.
The Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities in occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany and the USSR, there were not only a few individuals who were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or merely cowardlylyly or by pushing their heads into the sand.
This is not just a specific of these nations, we Czechs are likewise guilty.
In Germany, the deenacification came immediately, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
The most important thing, however, came later.
When the kids grew up, they started asking, "Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such venerations?"
How could you!
This has brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, German elites looked after the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't want to connect them back to Alsasko-Lotrinsko or someone - to revanš - military attack - I hope everyone will accept that.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitively closed at the turn of the millennia when the former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimír Putin came to power.
The criminal past is often celebrated in Russia today.
The politics of Putinov Russia is the revention, the capture of lost territory, the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of own people is not worth any value to a superintendent.
Beat thyself, and the strangers shall fear.
I still believe that it is only those decades of depot regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally minor - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from the growth of tension around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russia border in the Crimea area has deteriorated.
Whom does the growth of tension benefit?
After a longer period of relative peace, there has been another deterioration in relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The Ukrainian Party’s excuse became the Crimean peninsula, which was connected more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both sides of the enemy oppose and find it hard to check independently, and so we have the opportunity to think only about the old known question of whom does it benefit?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on the Crimean side of Ukraine, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, blames Kremlin on provocation.
Information on the arrest of Ukrainian special forces in Russia has already come from the Savchenková case, which is known to have been abducted in Russia.
If we proceeded to the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tension around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further validation of sanctions and reinforcement of the anti-Russia campaign.
In the last year, the background of the immigration crisis to Europe has come to a standstill from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukrainian leadership has already lost its total credit in front of its inhabitants, with President Porošenko’s current support moving around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would have long gone bankrupt without generous financial injections by the EU and mainly the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to pay close attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Polossenko and other members of the power forces are once again wanting to show up as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to Russia as well.
The only thing to hope for is that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but all ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and will stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria showed inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate reached 1 % in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest value for several years (from June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October of last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous period of 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 %.
The index of consumer prices in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so the monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2 % compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the travels of these groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Price decreases occurred in clothes and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained.
The U.S. Secret Service has been tracking the Russian hacks for a year.
The Russian attacks received public information last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the Democratic Party.
However, no official report on the Russian part of the attack is mentioned.
Moscow denied the attack.
The report on monitoring the alleged Russian attack was strictly classified because it would reveal that the U.S. secret services are monitoring and could also be the way they do it and what resources they use.
They say two Russian intelligence services were involved in the attack.
New Cyber Security Advisory Council
The material for tracking the Russian trails was encoded and access to it had only a small group of experts, wrote Reuters.
Only a small group of eight leading Members of Congress, known as the 8th gang, were informed of public officials.
It is made up by the heads of both the Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan Chambers, the Democrats in both Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid Chambers, and four members of the Congress Committees.
On Thursday, Chief of the Democratic Party, Donna Brazil announced that she was setting up an Advisory Council for Cyber Security, which is "to prevent future attacks and to ensure first class protection of the servers of the Democratic Party".
There was a dangerous parasite in a smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
Based on the initiative of the consumer for health problems after consumption of the food Losos wild smoked - pieces 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016 Prague hygienists carried out a check at the stores of Albert in Wenceslas Square and Na Mostek.
The audit found that the lot L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer referred to, was no longer available and therefore the product was collected from the same lot with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
The laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is the parasite worm of the lawn of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for a person - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen, and a man-breathed living larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Šticha.
We apologize to our customers for their problems with this branded product.
We downloaded this lot immediately from the sale and for preventive reasons we downloaded all other lots of this item as well.
There was a doubt on the part of the supplier that we are dealing with, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, said to the New spokesperson Alberta Barbora Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it in any of the chains stores and get the money back.
The larvae will destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrnya.
Hygienics have informed Prague and Central Czech veterinary authorities of the occurrence of a dangerous product.
According to the server, the safety of food.cz people after the loss of parasite may become ill with anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease may occur without a symptom, said the CTK.
The symptoms will be completed one hour to two weeks after consumption of under-treated fish.
After three weeks from the start of the larva disease, mostly spontaneously leaves the gastrointestinal tract.
Both adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, therefore they are killed either when sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or when freezing it.
The veterinarians have examined salmon as well as the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples tested had parasites in them.
The shipment with 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Expeditioned, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, was to date 919 packages.
Currently unsold stocks of the product from the stores are being downloaded, said Czech spokesperson Petr Pejchal on Friday.
The veterinarians immediately prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse after finding positive samples.
A 17-year-old Brit wanted to escape from Rakka, apparently killed by a Russian air strike.
After the initial enthusiasm and fast marriage with jihadita, who was suddenly killed, sobering up came.
For the British girls, the expected chlephate paradise turned into hell on earth, from which there was no escape.
The girl, according to her relatives, was in contact with her sister Halima.
She kept calling her back to Britain and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic state is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders without thinking about shooting, quotes The Telegraph lawyer of the family of the deceased girl Tasnim Akunje.
The last clues led to Rakka, the last call came from the girl.
Then all she had to do was report on her death, which can't be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together, they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they were hoping to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, because the house where she was staying was compared in May to the land of the raid, said the British ITV News.
The television said that the bomb apparently demolished a Russian plane that attacked the IS bastion in Syria.
You'd bring the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasni Akunje, family's lawyer.
In the week when (Kadiza) thought about fleeing the Islamic state, a Rakušan woman was caught trying to escape and, according to the information available, was publicly beaten to death.
I think she (Kadiza) interpreted it as a warning and decided not to take any risks, meant by the BBC Akunje.
A family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and 15-year-old friends from Shamima Begum and Amira Abas made their way on February 17 last year.
The only thing they said at home is that they're going out.
However, they headed for and from Gatwick Airport via Turkey in the territory controlled by IS.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in her power to get Kadiz back.
You'd take the blue one from the sky, just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family would do everything it could to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without them risking themselves being caught, the lawyer provided.
The only positive thing he thinks is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a dissuasive case for other girls or even boys who are being fooled by Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went there, realized how things were there, understood how far it was different from the promises of the Islamic State propaganda and wanted to go back," Akunje said.
The fate of Kadize's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also been silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries the village of Inveraway was the regional center and the seat of the Duke of Argill.
From the middle of the 18th century, courts and basements under the hall have served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts lived were pitiful and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them and successfully.
Therefore, city representatives decided to move to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more friendly to prisoners, it had heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it was not in operation for long, for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, as smaller corrective devices were costly to operate and did not pay too much.
The stories of convicts and the hunt for ghosts.
For the public, the prison opened centuries later, and visitors can compare the old building with the new building to see how different conditions prevailed.
The guides in time costumes still strengthen the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists may be allowed to close to one of the cells, mostly due to a photograph of the monument, or to create a feeling behind bars of prisoners.
Moreover, Inveraway prison is one of the most famous Scottish sites where it is allegedly haunted.
Several groups of paranormal activity hunters have gone out there and still the museum allows people to come and hunt.
Such a night will come to £300, which is approximately CZK 9500 in the conversion.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app allows around 150 million users to change reality every day and to deal with the identity of ways bordering absurdity.
You can make a pineapple, a dog, or a character out of the picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfs every day.
Any mistake shall be made public immediately.
The Snapchat filters in the past have earned a criticism of the charge that the application promotes blackfacing or that it supports white shades of skin as the ideal of beauty.
So when this week's filter was offered to the users, thanks to which their eyes were slim, their teeth were curved and their faces were inflated, some critics called it a racist cartoon of the Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated contentious questions would point to a greater problem of society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and indignation spread rapidly, and Snapchat immediately said the next day that he canceled.
The company offered an explanation: Filter was intended as a presentation of the accounts to the characters of the animation, not as a cartoon of the Asians.
But observers who witnessed racism reminded the filter of painful stereotypes in action.
The others, without cover, refused to compare with the animated ones.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean student whose tweet of photographs was widely shared, stated in her e-mail that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it is hard to argue against the comparison of obvious Asian caricatures and filter effects.
It appears that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is drawn to the contemptible extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural limits.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from sitting halls in corporations to Holywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially differentiated than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some users,” said 25 - year - old Katie Zhuová on Thursday in an interview, “it’s very hard to get around these things today without notice as before.”
Katie Zhuová, a product manager and designer who works for the Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and invite others to do the same.
In an article for the Media and in an interview on the phone, she stated that she is convinced that racially motivated problems reflect the lack of diversity in recruiting workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuová criticized the predominant white, entirely male management of the company and ended the article with the hash tag: # downSnapchat.
“It is either that there is no diversity among employees and colourful people at the time when they decide on these things,” said Zhuová, who has Chinese-American origin, “or color people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to speak.”
Other observers share her view - the complaint that Snapchat left largely without reply.
The company does not publish numbers relating to the diversity of its employees, with the fact that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his staff, but according to the spokesperson, the company recently accepted a recruiting worker, which should focus on the under-represented population and the internal management of inclusion.
Zhuová adds: “I’m curious if they really need other users who can say it’s not okay,” with the fact that their account will remain cancelled.
Military officers have distorted intelligence about IS, says the parliamentary committee
The Parliamentary Committee stated in the report issued on Thursday that officers from the United States Central Command changed intelligence reports in order to illustrate a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events of the country.
According to a preliminary report by the working group drawn up by the President of the Republic of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Subcommittee, a "extensive dissatisfaction" was identified among the Central Intelligence Service analysts, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of the American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is an army headquarters in Tampa, Florida, overseeing US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A press release to the report states: “Excessions of intelligence secret services approved by Centcom’s superior officers usually offered a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorism efforts than confirmed by the facts on earth, and were more consistent than those obtained from other parts of the reporting community. ”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our warriors are damaged when a false analysis is submitted to superior policymakers," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican from California.
The failure in the management of Centcom reaches the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the continuing problems of the central staff in describing and analysing US efforts in the training of Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decisive evidence that the leaders of Obama’s administration ordered the reports to be amended, it states in the report that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from Centum’s leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many central staff press reports, statements and statements from the congress were significantly more positive than what events were,” says the report.
For example, Centcom’s representative publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosula could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is very clear after months of investigation," Mr Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican Party from Kansas, said in his statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top position of the U.S. central intelligence staff was manipulated by staff intelligence personnel in order to ignore the dangers of IS in iraq.
The Republicans have compiled a working group after they have learned of the concerns of analysts that intelligence information concerning the Islamic State is being manipulated.
Following a report published on Thursday, further investigations must be carried out.
In Centcom's intelligence, there is another investigation conducted by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
On Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which corresponded to some conclusions of the Republican working group.
“For the years 2014 and 2015 Centcom has set up a very close process to compile an evaluation of information on IS and Iraqi security components,” said the representative Adam B. Schiff, president of the Committee and representatives of Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “actually overturned the results of intelligence services,” he damaged the morale among analysts and “sufferingly taken into account dissenting views.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have not found any evidence that the White House would attempt to push the Centralcom analysts to adjust their conclusions according to "presidency or political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, New York Times reported an ongoing investigation into the general inspector of the Pentagon, which was initiated after the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Commander-in-command Patrick Evans, Pentagon spokesperson, stated in the statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the parliamentary report because the investigation of the general inspector is still ongoing.
He stated, however, that "experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of comprehensive data and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security."
The investigation has an impact beyond the question of whether American bombings are successful in Iraq and Syria (a year now declaring an increasing number of defence representatives).
However, last year's charges raised questions as to the extent to which President Obama can rely on the fact that the central staff honestly evaluates military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The crisis of intelligence about the Islamic State has been reflecting conflicts for more than ten years, when the intelligence analyst at Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that President George W. Bush's administration, despite the objections of many analysts, has defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker's team concluded that, despite public statements of the contrary, air strikes against the refineries of the Islamic State did not significantly weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group because the group has built temporary refineries and is selling oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that findings were not sent out to central staff.
Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism over the past year after many legislators have found the testimony of the Senate too positive by evaluating the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at Centcom.
The United States has won the fourth game of ground hockey in a row, so today we will play a decisive game in the team of Great Britain.
Katie Bam, in a match against Japan, who ended up winning 6:1, scored three goals and only a day later, for the American women's ground hockey team, shot the first two goals of the match in which India 3:0.
Five goals in two games is a success worthy of remembering, but Bam (27) said that she was not sure if she had ever succeeded in such a thing.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong to those who write their goals down.
But this is what he knows: the Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to 4:0 matches and they share the first place in the group with the Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after Japan's defeat 2:0 remained undefeated.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals, and the game will decide who of the six teams will finish first and who will second.
The team from the first place will be a little longer avoided by the strong Danes who are at the forefront of the second group.
Whatever the end of the Saturday game, the Americans here, by their surprising ride, caused a start, four years after they ended up playing in London among the 12 teams.
Bam was on that team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and she took a hockey hockey game for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older sisters played in Drexel) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't get on the final roster.
Then came 2012 when she did not have much success, neither did she nor her team members.
The following year, Craig Parnham was appointed coach and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
In London, we didn't have as much work as we do today.
We made a complete turn.
On Thursday night Bamová started the first half shooting goal near bekendem.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team turned out to be surprisingly hard and maintained the score of 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam took the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then she clicked into the center and shot the ball into the goal to get the American to lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of an American goalie, Jackie Briggs, who in each of the three victories helped one goalie, was the first ever at the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
“We are in a good place now,” said Parnham, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of the Saturday match.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic basking
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro it is to feel persistent, indescribable and aroused rotation of competition and effort.
It's how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot baton pin that was passed from the archer to the swimmer, gymnast and triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the front of a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or vexation between Michael Phelps and Chad le Closes.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming doll of women with dolls in their faces, is on the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names sound in households in the main broadcast time between advertising and the spots of sponsors, if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in a trampoline jump.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine on all the competitions as well.
Far from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from air pistols, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the inconspicuous charm of trampoline.
Although the jumps on the trampoline have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first listed in Sydney's games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport has remained almost unnoticed - many of the people I questioned, nor did it know it was an Olympic sport.
It may be regional indifference.
The U.S. never won a medal in trampoline jumps, and until 2012 none of the athletes even made it to the finals.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will mark Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The jumps on the trampoline, however, have more bad luck, partly because the ear of the uninvited one would seem more suitable for the clown university than for the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but I'm just an enthusiast watching the country.
It has a comic potential - comical vibration of infinite reflection - but also the sweetness of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline" meaning "jumpboard."
Aspirating champions jump on a huge trampoline, which shoots them to a height of almost 10 meters and presents sets with several elements (salta, twists and combinations) before they finally land again on their feet.
According to the official Olympic Programme, they are assessed according to the implementation, difficulty and "times in the air".
In Rio there will be 23 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual olympic trajectory is forward.
Fighters for the gold medal must go on, faster and higher, sometimes until the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They try not only to catch up with the finish tape or the starting wall, but, as television news reports say, also another line of thought: the world or the Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fantastic - and sufficient for audiences to bring tears.
But I think it's also a little exhausting when you're watching the Olympics.
Jumping on the trampoline in this regard brings relief.
Athlete's track on the trampoline is up.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects like they're in a state without weightless as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
There is no competition, and of course there is no difficulty, but during the duration of the line-up, there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no measuring distance, but just perfect, smooth springing of time and gravity.
This is the closest that the Olympics and the Zen will come near.
The qualifications and finals of the women take place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock Eastern time, the male competition then on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will broadcast the final within the afternoon block, which starts for both days at 14 o'clock.
In the middle of the Olympic madness promise a calm, pleasant moment that you will probably miss through the other battles.
And if attention is to be achieved only by the fact that male athletes will be the subject of in love with views and materialization - as the magazine Wall Street Journal recently suggested by the gymnasts of the United States - then Logan Dooley just waits for his new fans who fall for the breath.
"Protesting Generation" in Ethiopia, the United States' long-standing allies
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators requiring political change in Ethiopia have encountered a violent opposition of the government.
Witnesses say that many protesters were shot during clashes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has seized anti-government unrest that spreads to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to organisations fighting for human rights, the government's response was unmerciful.
Witnesses say the cops shot and killed the crowds of unarmed demonstrators.
On the collapsing videos of protests that are likely to come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, security forces are captured as young people beat by sticks after they were forced to stand by the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, Head of the Horn of Africa Research Group for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of terrorist attacks in the area, especially in Somalia, and few from African countries, if any, obtain such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - in the capital of Addis Abeba there is even a new suburban train.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - organisations fighting for human rights without ceasing talk about government repression - opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many were banished, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But that can change.
"When you smother people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
It protests all youths.
He's been protesting for generations.
The complaints are many and concern everything from land disputes to absolute control of the power of the governing coalition.
Following last year's elections, which were widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies gained the last chair held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in Parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border is increasing with Eritrea. The conflict along this unexplained, disputed border demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Anonymists fear that separatist groups, which have been more or less repressed over the past years, such as the Oromian Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to exploit and rearm.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of snuffing under the surface, these bitter feelings have become more bitter.
The first one is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks for up to the last few years, when they have become commonly available cheaper smartphones and improved the provision of internet services.
And although the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as it is commonly happening especially during protests, many people can still communicate via the Internet proxy that hides the location of these people.
A few young Ethiopians talked about how they were gathering for protests.
There is also greater solidarity between Oroma and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and the Amhars are not natural allies.
After a long time, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, stood out in politics and trade and used the Oromas, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
“We are on our way to a united leadership,” said Mulata Gemmachu, leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests took place in areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms feel that Ethiopia is ill-dominating by the members of the Tigray ethnicist, which is around 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the insurgents, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister of government for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he fell ill.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly masterful to reveal the initial signals of dissatisfaction and to use the emissaries to process and win opponents on his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was brought out of relative ignorance to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't have confidence in security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
Last Ethiopia experienced such unrest in 2005 after thousands protested against what analysts referred to as the elections that the government took and then stole.
He followed a hard hit during which many protesters were killed - although less than in the past months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts appreciated Ethiopia’s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is clear that the gradual growth of disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop this.
And dangerous ethnic formation happens.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, Amhar, attacked companies owned by Tigrei, and a grudge against the Tigrei on social networks were becoming more and more common.
Analysts say that protests put the United States and other Western allies in an unpleasant situation.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently declared that the base has been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to fall apart in an already unstable area.
"This," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement on Obama and IS funding as "sarcasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to ignore the latest controversy that flooded his campaign by saying that he didn't mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the Islamic State's terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions regarding the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to speak clearly with the American public.
They also put his supporters in an unpleasant situation, who hardened him at a stormy time, and must explain that he might not have been serious about his remarks.
After this proposal for a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed Thursday's statement, and in the interviews he insisted that he did not really intend to say that President and H. Clinton's IS were created.
However, in his contribution to Twitter on Friday morning, Trump stated that he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was the opposite of the claim of the old one day when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When Conservative Radio Moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump ease the remark by reminding him that Obama was trying to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes the moment Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in the election surveys are falling.
Trump and Clinton took part in the Michigan duel on economic issues this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this topic again.
On Twitter, he warned again that the Clintons' proposals were linked to an increase in taxes, and he said that according to some of them, her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm defense before.
At the end of July, when he collected a wave of criticism when he made a suggestion that the Russians should penetrate Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comment: "I am obviously sarcastic."
This approach enables Trump to push the limits of political statements and to moderate them as necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing to what extent some of the reports have a response to his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction one or the other, Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language they both used.
However, I also think that he is skillful in his statements, and he knows that they are sufficiently vague to be explained in various ways.
Since the results of the election surveys continue to decline in its favour, Trump has chosen an even more pampered tone in recent days, instead of making things mild for the general voters.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very closely behind it in Florida.
Trump is even trying to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he says, but he often accuses his criticism of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But along with Trump's recent presidential campaign facing increased attention, Trump's jokes put his loyal supporters, who must stand behind him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had a candidate on Thursday in an interview for CNN to strongly defend.
“I believe that what he is saying is a legitimate political comment,” said Giuliani, when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama was almost unknown, a small organization which he was completely mistakenly calling a newcomer, and it occurred because he had withdrawn his troops from Iraq.
Most common Republicans are trying to argue that Obama’s government, in which Clinton acted as a foreign minister, allowed the IS to bloated and unable to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to be on Twitter with a fire on the media for pushing every word of it and being interested in it.
He laughed at "the pathetic, pathetic" television scholars who tried to understand him and said, "They can't do that!"
A few Democrats have suffocated Trump's apology with the fact that it's just another proof that he's not eligible for the presidency.
The cafe's been pushed out of the market for prices, and now it's returning to Greenpoint.
The Verb Cafe was a fucked-up place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
It naturally occurred that she was pushed out of the front door on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store thatVerb replaced in summer 2014 - sells soap in the shape of cupcakes.
The locals wept as the last loss of a growing city.
On Twitter, Artist Molly Crabapple wrote: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea’s hotel is stuffed with soap now. ”
But if New York is a change, then it's also a rediscoverion.
The raisedVerb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe, which is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
In Verb he started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his clients offered to pay him to move to a new place, he said he would do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
The Verb still has the same bread supplier and bought the same model of espresso machines.
He even re-used the lighting from old Verb.
Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The offer includes sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find brown rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months Rodriguez noticed the constant influx of the original stamgasts.
"A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of prices," he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg, and she went to Verb Cafe frequently.
Even then, when the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that whenVerb closed, she completely stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I love is coffee and culture in Verb," she said.
Now he drinks coffee again, but on that day, instead of his usual iced coffee, he gave a mixed chai, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
He goes before work and always orders the same thing.
"In the quarter and eight of every day, as a watch, I come and prepare for me a violin with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add a new ingredient to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he gets bacon, egg, and ham on his violin.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, Soap Cherie's owners offered to make a special soap forVerb and use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we can still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also accepted the cafe well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said that he wanted to find a place where he would soon expose it to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juice producer wants to download into bottles and sell filtered coffee.
It is offered to expand the coffee shop to a neighbouring building.
A lot of customers just got their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr Whitt says when the coffee shop reopened, walk in and have a coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
A depressing food from a time of crisis - in “Square Meal”
Shortly after joining the President's office in March 1933 Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
Labudník President Roosevelt enjoyed some of the selected dishes from the 5th avenue, such as the snuff of goose livers and the Marylandian turtle soup.
His menu for this day was more modest: eggs in the devil's way in a paradise sauce, potato pure and like dessert plum pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat. ”
The couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are devoted to gastronomic history.
The last book by Andrew Coe "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in his book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of a house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal" published on Tuesday by Harper is the history of American cuisine during a major economic crisis.
Sami showed their cooking solidarity, and they met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small strait buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered creamy cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had turkey, potato porridge and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball that, according to a couple, was well suited for a conversation about food during the crisis.
"The carbats were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
It was sold with peanut, liver and beans.
They were made of that mixture and other cheap foods that the ingredients set.
Change the amount of beets you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe's got a pinch.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a buffet to eat what you eat.
Teams of women were cooking for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch and dinner were served freshly cooked cake.
They were Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" observes how the nation dealt with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central point for the American people,” said Coe, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The same was the new budget diet: Mysterious Foods, Carbaquets and Food from Castres, Castres as “a wonderful way to take advantage of the remains,” Ziegelman noted, because the cooks could hide non-esthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The meat - after years of central America’s food - has become a cost-effective luxury.
The strange mixtures that were intended to serve as caloric and nutritional supplements were preferred to taste or even to common sense when cooking.
During the research for a book that contains recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a period meal from a roasted onion filled with peanut butter.
"It was not a favorite addition to the evening table," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: "It was surreal."
The peanut butter and baked onion don't work together.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, swords of the Federal Office for the Home Economy from 1923 to 1943 - governed the country's eating habits.
They were publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, calling on women to take over the budget, and slenders, such as cream spaghetti with carrots, turned into tasteful foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, the desserts were created in response to the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's pose, "I'm going to have a pie".
While publicly praised his childhood’s simple Irish farmer’s kitchen, he was a selected millionaire.
“The pleasure was eating continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce,” said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in a almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him follow an example of his own stomach.
As the book says, Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in the taste at all, resulting in the White House being “not only serving the most precious food in Washington, but also in the most unpleasant way prepared.”
A number of dietary habits from the time of the crisis were heard as soon as the country was back on its feet.
The legacy remained in our continuous examination of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science applied to cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they understood Miss Ziegelman's mother's eating habits better, like why she couldn't throw out food.
"She had real fear of wasting food," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman reminded: “The people were bad. ”
There's been an accident with a wreath.
When Eisenberg's tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled the dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had ate for lunch.
“It’s called plum cream,” Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give a modest recipe an elegant name.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to put a spoon in dense brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added one more time.
And as a proper host, he told his wife: “A bit of meat would be of meat to the lumberjacks. ”
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most refugees who are going to Europe are coming for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
That's what the show would look like if we did.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us make fun of their native country.
With a photoshop, he creates collages that funnyly show what it would look like if famous series and films were shot in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to pay for legal representation costs in the case of hepatitis C patent against Merck
The district court judge has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal fees incurred by her in the case of a hepatitis C patent against the manufacturer of medicines from Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment that Gilead was to pay 200 million for the damage caused by the violation of the two Merck patents in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge repeatedly found the anti-law proceedings on the part of Merck, among other things lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal judge Beth Labson Freeman stated on Thursday that Gilead is entitled to a remission of the charges incurred in connection with the representation of the case.
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the new generation of drugs against hepatitis C that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes from 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active component of the medicines from Gilead.
The Americans supported by military forces claim to have gained full control of Manběja
Military troops supported by the US gained full control of the northern city of Manběja near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, said the spokesperson of the group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Force (SDF) now sweeps the city after the rest of the radical group that hid in the city.
The troops freed over 2,000 civilians that radicals arrested, told Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manběja military council.
“The city is now under our full control, but we are still searching it,” said Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return on Friday, stating that the presidential candidate for the Democrats and her husband had an income of $10.75 million in that year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, they donated $1 million to the Clinton Foundation (Clinton Foundation) to the charity. Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed almost $5.3 million to the joint cash register, and the former Foreign Secretary admitted an income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her function at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's co-director, American Senator Tim Caine from Virginia, and Anne Holton, released a tax return in 10 years.
Those in 2015 paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine remain a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped the Clinton campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats from his previous promises to make his tax returns public.
It is customary for US Presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose them.
Trump, a businessman in New York City, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the U.S. Treasury Tax Department as a reason for refusing to publish the tax return.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's campaigner on Twitter, following up on a tax return from a democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, a special advisor to Trump, told CNN Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax return until the audits were over.
According to Trump's critics, among which the republican candidate for the 2012 President Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, commercial transactions and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton spoke strongly on the issue and released on Friday a video reminding him how high the republicanship of Trump insisted that he publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, I will mention my speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all other candidates have done for the presidency for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said in front of people.
Politicalo said that Trump paid no or very low taxes over the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim to be so can be present.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the President's choice.
Clinton advocates a rule named after the billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that everyone who earns more than $1 million a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at the Clinton Assembly in Omaza, Nebraska, where Buffalo's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway was established, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also went through the IRS audit and that Trump was "not afraid" of the Financial Office, but the voters.
Clinton's campaign published a tax return back to 2007.
On average, between 2007 and 2014, the Clintons who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid a federal tax of 32 percent on average and a combined tax of approximately 40,5 percent.
Clinton's tax return for 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, it only makes a salary of $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons provided income on dividends and interest of $109 000.

Condoms filled with chili or elephant protection fireworks in Tanzania
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use a nonortodox way to prevent elephants from going to human homes - they throw condoms filled with chili powder.
The process was proven and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American Environmental Organization The Nature Conservancy, promoted this process and trained volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania, how through this nonviolent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves earlier.
Friday is a world day of elephants dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they developed this... set of instruments, we have recorded a change of behavior in these communities. People believe that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said the executive director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Foundation in the statement.
The first and second step is to shine the battery through the elephant and start the horn.
If it doesn't dissuade him, there's a so-called "chilli blue".
Chilli powder mixed with salt with a firecracker wrapped in a condom, its end is so that only kangaroo can see from it.
After the condom has been blown up, the fine chilli powder is scattered into the air.
Most of the time, one breath is enough, and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to set off a fireworks that causes a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director resisted the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel on the "request" of Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused excitement in the media after he found out that Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin had no call code in it for Israel, according to the employees' words, based on the "require" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of a documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah", ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German journal FAZ.
During his recent stay Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel call code list.
However, the state has not been mentioned among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, the capital city of Germany, Israel, was removed and deleted in Berlin?
Lanzmann wrote.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers an opportunity to call to Israel through its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel's reception with the problem.
According to Lanzmann, the answer she received was "shocked".
The hotel worker replied that the measure was "decided after considering the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this step was even more for the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they required the calling code of Israel to be deleted,” quoted Lanzmann’s employees in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman referred to the case as "a great shame".
We were horrified and shocked by the events.
It's a huge shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in addition to that in the hotel chain is even more shameful.
There's no need for another explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event triggered a strong online response, and people called it scandalous.
Some believe that Kempinski has simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
"Hanba to you," is mentioned in another paper, which points to the fact that the hotel located in Kurfurstendamm’s noble street is located near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel himself, the hotel quickly dropped any charges by calling the event "overseeing" and Lanzman "spouse".
“never a direct order has been issued” does not include Israel in the call code list, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung the representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
He adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesting Brazilian students
Students and police clashed in San Paul, Brazil on Thursday, when students met at a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesters.
The problem got worse when the government's order service tried to get the students started, which ended with the police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the Governor of San Paulo Gerald Alckmina in order to save money is also the closure of almost hundreds of public schools and the relocation of 300 000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration could see how they spray the inscriptions on the wall against temporary President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators made their way to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff's disembarkation when the Senate in the country decided to sue her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan increased trade turnover by 70.9 percent after the abolition of the sanctions between Moscow and Tehran in the year-on-year comparison.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran have been repealed, there has been an increase in the interest of Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached USD 856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent and reached 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jumper increase in trade has secured supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Over the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued around 35,000 visas for Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
In addition, Iran first reached the top of 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be overcome," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
“I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,” he said.
Scotsman Callum Skinner is in a hurry to go home after the British got gold in the cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the hall of fame last night in the male team sprint at the Velodro in Rio when the VB team's trio defended the title from London 2012.
A 23-year-old native from Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and a legend youth pleased when he hit the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after the end of the modest sixth at the world championship in the track biking in March, even though Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for Jamie Staff's specialised opening racer.
Hindes appeared just in time.
After Hoye left, the site was also released, which tried to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British trainers, and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was along with Hoy's champion four years ago - and with Skinner they reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but the t-shirt took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British Trio got gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change in strategy was a great part of the transformation when Hintes went on a higher transition to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep up.
Hoy's race followed the BBC commentator from his position, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes stepped on stage, he didn't let his eyes out.
A 23 - year - old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: “It is a flattering comparison. ”
I'm here to get the best out of myself and do my name's honor.
We made an Olympic record in the finals, and we beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After triumphing next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he fell on the track on purpose after a weak start.
He later pulled the note back and the rivals of Britain had no chance to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said: “With all the British flags on the stands, I felt like London.”
In the last three months, we all came together as a team.
We lost in many global races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for the nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is supposed to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we will have a successful five days on the Velodrom.
With Kenny's form, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time at one Olympics.
This would then be for Kenny - which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also on the 23rd of March (this date seems sacred for British sport, on this day also celebrates Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold medals and one silver medal.
As much as Hoy got.
As next, Kenny will be participating in a sprint that starts today and takes another three days.
A 20 - year - old at Bolton said: “Now I enjoy this one.
Team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “When he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knight’s title. ”
It was the only medal race that day, but Britain was expecting more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest to race teams for four kilometers.
They're done with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (22:42) are held today on the second day of the race, which will certainly focus on Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualification race, he debated with the Commissioner when the referees called him to measure his height.
In a similar race of women that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowesell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie achieved a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relyed on its strong team of track cycling and took over the middle period of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, proving an absolute predominance in Beijing and London, during the preparation of Rio's expectations decreased.
The background was followed by dramatic events, last but not least by the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to the accusations of sexism and discrimination, and the termination of the career of the greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of velodrom races, it seems that the legendary reputation that the team of Great Britain can submit top performance with perfect timing could be confirmed again.
Uncertainty future of a factory in Portland after the end of the contract for the supply of energy
The future of the Portland aluminium mill in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant which supplies electricity and which informed of the intention of one of its owners to terminate the electricity supply contract. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be cut short.
This step takes place after the Government of the State of Victoria had decided earlier this year that it would not extend the supply of subsidies that the undertaking is maintaining in progress.
The fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk in Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk when closing.
And since the mill consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be other avalanable effects.
Alcoa closed Point Henry's production plant in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's production plant in Portland is a commercial one, and it's threatened to be closed.
This step is followed by several years of speculation about the future of the company, originally in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for the production of the plant.
AGL, which supplies power from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley Valley, declared that one of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is Alcoa and Aluminium joint venture, a small business share held by CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the mine will continue,” she said.
AGL claimed that the contracts are the so-called ‘security contracts’ that were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that their validity will actually end in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for the fiscal year 2017’, the power plant declared.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits from the fiscal year 2018 is further limited today due to a strong outlook on the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already written the value of contracts according to its accounting books of USD 187 million “in case of termination.”
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract ‘does not have an impact on its ability to operate a rolling stock or to secure the supply of electricity to a rolling mill’.
The US company stated that in 2010 Loy Yang had signed a 20-year contract, which was due to start from November of this year, although it still had to explain why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are very careful with regard to the possible closure of the Portland production plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
The head of operations of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who at the beginning of this week turned to analysts, said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these companies withdrew from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in market demand [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a producer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian Real Estate Show - now it is the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), a model and fourth daughter of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner Klan Klan, appeared on the front page of the September edition of the American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, an ambassador to Estee Lauder, who presented at a fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced a new report on Thursday in her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, looking at this front page wants to cry,” Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the front page followed a bizarre (or simply continuing humorous in the submission of the Kardashians?) staged video, in which the entire family of the Kardashian-Jenners (bar outlaws of Rob and Caitly and along with them all favorite uncles from the show, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On the cover of their sister forgot only so that the scene could end with a classic turnout: they prepare a secret party.
It's a well-played storyline of almost every "birth" child's TV show (Seacrest says: "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on the show at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris somehow needed to make sure that the other girls in this publicity could feed on.
Because if we look at the Vogue magazine's September issue, we certainly joined the Kardashians' new era.
Senior sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September edition of the magazine is another league.
The September edition of Vogue magazine is the most sold number of the year.
The publication, which, by its thickness, resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist calculated that last year's edition of 832 pages was 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star, which appears on the front page, is unexpectedly expected, so it is no wonder that in the past two years the pictures of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on an envelope in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the title page has certainly appeared more "celebrites that model" than "models that are celebrities".
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar's holder and Dior's ambassador, appeared on the headline in 2013, one year later, Lagy Gaga had the honor.
However, although it is very unlikely that Kendall - described by the magazine as its generation's "half-model" - will fall into the first category, will be in a very good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people, nor to the stars of the real estate shows, or to the children of today, who know how to make a well-cut video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are provenly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career due to the release of Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymorová, original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "girls of the moment".
These feelings went up again with a message about Jenner showing up on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner's on the cover of September Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's showing for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you a make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paws.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for LAVE magazine.
And in his spare moments, he's acting on the reality show, maybe just one way to see Kourtney and her kids.
The Community legal aid centres will reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 most vulnerable citizens are refused legal aid centres each year, and in the sector themselves they are preparing for the consequences that will have further limitations on funding for the already excessively busy services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without funds to fight unfair eviction and so on - are rejects already at a time when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal services, which are already so tense to crack, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 percent of federal finances.
According to the latest summary report by the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, 5,000 people were rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without canceling the federal government's decision, the situation will worsen.
"The community legal aid centres in Queensland are chronically sub-financed, which means that thousands of people are denied vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from their relationship with a rapist, people with excessive and depreciating debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly released - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce its funding by 30 percent, leading to thousands of other vulnerable people from Queensland who will have to focus on complex legal problems without aid.
We call on the D.A. and Senator Queensland George Brandis to immediately prevent this cut-off so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the last year, the Government has fulfilled its commitment to provide legal aid up to a national average.
Now it is time to look at the needs of the community legal aid centres and the community of their clients and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
A lawsuit for Donald Trump's campaign after a staff member reportedly aimed a weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was filed for alleged inaction after they were told that the head of operations in North Carolina in February aimed a gun at a member of the staff during the Jeep.
The incident was described in a court file, which was handed over to Vincent Bordini on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte, a former state-owned software instructor.
Bordini said that he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that "it would not happen".
Director Earl Phillip “marked his fingers with a gun, gave his right trigger finger and pointed his head on Vincent’s face,” said Bordini in the lawsuit.
The file states that after a complaint with local and regional campaign management, the Bordini discovered that at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip.
"Weapon doesn't have to fire to cause harm," he told Bordin in the lawsuit.
The prosecution comes only two days after the Republican candidate for president made an alarm when he told the voters in North Carolina that the owners and owners of the arms (which is modified in the second amendment of the Constitution) could intervene if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and was able to appoint his judge.
Trump's campaign says that the media pulled his words out of context and that Trump was not defending violence.
In the action, the Bordins ask for compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and Phillip for jeopardising personal security, illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump's spokesperson Hope Hicks didn't respond immediately to the commentary report.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local intelligence branch in Charlotte, announced that Phillip recently left the campaign.
Phone call to his advisory company Innovative Consulting Services no one responded within a short time.
Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is conducting a controversial election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of restoration and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London but across the country.
For me Heathrow is extremely attractive, just like London 2012, when we have made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
Olympic games meant huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again so that we create opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities will we create 10,000 new teaching sites, 40,000 new jobs and end the unemployment of young people in the vicinity of the airport.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, there will also be some who will think that the extension of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would laugh at the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even Heathrow turns out they weren't right.
It will always be necessary to overcome the obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a project of infrastructure involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave behind heritage in the form of skills and jobs both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team on Heathrow, which, in its deadline and budget, has introduced an investment program for 11 billion pounds, starting with the T5 terminal, which was chosen by the world's best terminal for five years, after Terminal T2, which was built between the two busiest earlys in the world.
Now they're ready to deliver a third ranch worth £16 billion of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success of Great Britain and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will be one as well.
It is time for us to continue spreading the spirit of the Olympic Games and to expand Heathrow, secure trading in the future and leave behind the heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Minister of Finance Business Affairs.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in a game of cat and mouse blocking ads
From attempts to circumvent programs blocking advertising, for companies making money on online marketing it became a game of cat and mouse. At least it is claimed by one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a post on its website stating that users can update the filters in their program and again block the advertising on this social network.
Facebook stated on Tuesday that his desktop website will change the coding around advertising to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already been circumvented.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams in his blog post wrote that “this kind of war between the open source community blocking ads and those trying to bypass them has been going on since the blocking of ads has been invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another repair of its own.
The fact that a company that owns the largest social network in the world was involved in the war only proves how much the blocking of advertising for the industry has become.
According to the study, last year, Pagefair and Adobe use advertising filters around 200 million people around the world - almost four times as much as in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of the profits of Facebook advertising, each day Facebook from mobile devices will visit 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker said, however, that the company goes against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile advertising filters for mobile applications for social networks and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on the desktop still represents a profit that high enough to Facebook decide to invest in it.
Facebook also stated on Tuesday that it would update the "ad preferences" tool to give people the opportunity to better control how they are displayed.
On Thursday Facebook said that the new Adblock filters are concerned because they could also block content that is unrelated to advertising.
“This is not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to solve this problem,” the spokesperson said in an e-mail statement.
The blocking of advertising is an insensitive tool, and we therefore preferred to focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences that will control people.
A woman was hit by a Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses of an event that a woman who probably tried to commit suicide on the highway of several cars on Thursday morning.
An accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight in Thursday.
In a statement, the Vaud police stated that the actor was lying on the road in the dark and several cars ran over her.
It's clear that the victim, a woman of 49, wanted to kill herself and hit her with several cars, including a truck.
She died on the scene.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but according to the police, everyone has not been identified yet. The police are calling these drivers and all the others who have witnessed an accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logic" step in a situation like this, said Le Tribune de Geneve's attorney Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether one of the drivers involved will face any accusations.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
This is what the prosecutor needs to find out," said Hofstetter.
On the basis of two similar cases over the past five years, it seems that drivers will not be held liable.
In both cases - one of which was a person on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect pedestrians who crossed the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was deprived of the charge of death from negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 highway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
It was said in the court that the victim drank alcohol at the age of 22 and passed out on the road.
The court found that a police officer - who responded to an emergency call - was driving in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident in Morges should apply to the police at number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
Tolerable city.
Prague is the favorite destination of the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague in Prague Pride.
On Friday, the executive director of AČCK Kateřina Petříčková told us.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on 8 August, the festival brings closer to life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Praha is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialised companies," said Petříčková.
According to a survey of organizers, foreign visitors spend CZK 3100 per person on average daily.
Gay tourists are available to support their travels special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, interested in stays in higher prices with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium will also be held in the programme of the festival this year.
Experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China are speaking.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14th.
The main topic this year is love, but the action will also address a number of thematic areas, which are family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The festival's peak will be a traditional parade on Saturday with allegorical cars that will go from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
In recent years, thousands of people participated in the Guide, this year honors a minute's silence of the victims of the June attack at the Orlando Night Club, where the attacker shot 49 people, mainly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrate forty years.
Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, are entertained by small and large audiences forty years.
The pilot part of this evening's series directed by Lubomír Benes was premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, now known by viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, there were cartoons by artist and director Lubomír Benes, who invented for a magazine with two stumbling men Ouholiček and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the dramaturist Jiří Kubíček and artist Vladimír Jiránek to work together with the film Kuťáci.
Today's form with yellow and red shirt and ball and radio got characters in 1979, when the series for Slovak television began to be created in the short film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then received by the kutil in 1985, this time it was made directly for Krátý film Praha.
In 1990 Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other parts were created.
After his death in 1995, other works were continued with other creators, many of whom were involved by the son of Benes Mark.
At present, there are over 90 episodes with stories of these kutils, which are all filled with hands, but they never get mad at each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and kutilian enthusiasm and eventually they are satisfied with their work, which proves by the familiar gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theatres and figures or other toys with the image of Pat and Mata are the hit of every toy industry.
A story for Fiji and two-year-old Harmonia.
The end of the week is a sign of fairy tales, we chose one sport and one of life for you.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what kind of things do people spend most of their lives spending most on airports?
It's a Friday review from the world's websites.
The first Olympic medal.
Historical success celebrates the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's selection of this archipelago was defeated in the finale of the Olympic tournament of the 7th Rugby team of Great Britain.
It's actually the first medal that Fiji won at the Olympics for himself.
Waiting for the profit of the first precious metal took 60 years to send the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
Coach Fiji is a great success.
It is ironic, however, that it is Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been in charge since 2013 and, after the finale as a British citizen, could be satisfied with its compatriots.
"Let's play freely and lightly and see if we can make the biggest game in our history," the coach said before the finals.
Fiji finally took control of it sovereignly, and a small state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The report was delivered by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who's been living without her hands and her feet for 11 months, got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," a two-year-old girl rejoiced to reveal her mother to ABC News.
She added that her daughter liked to take her arms and legs off and then sit together without prosthesis.
Harmony was diagnosed in less than a year of life with meningitis type B, and doctors only gave her a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He's got a lot of perspective.
I saw her introduce herself to other kids with words Hi, I'm Harmonie, and I don't have hands, my mother added.
Look at the joy of the doll.
What are we spending most on at the airport?
CNN brings out the findings that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
The Hudson's sales chain travel essential stores has published data for the last year, which summarizes 10 products that customers at their airports buy most often.
The water was sovereignly first.
The drinks were generally very popular, eight were placed in the first ten.
The ninth place occupied a large package of M&M candy with coconut flavor.
And can you guess who's closing the first ten?
As the only one of the above things, you can't eat.
CNN says it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, they were laughing at Murray and Bond.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have been sovereign kinging the category of couples without a steering wheel for seven years and have confirmed their dominance in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, an uncooperative couple have moved on to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing competition since 2009.
Rodrigo de Freitas added 69th prize in the finals of Thursday.
What are we different from the others in?
We're just nicer, joked Murray during the Olympic regatta when he was supposed to answer questions about the domination of the New Zealand couple.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different than the others.
We're just training hard, really hard.
And we are constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, said Murray more seriously.
Their domination is remarkable even because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two-footed and a Stokil chaser, academia looking at Bond is five inches [5 cm] smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they are of a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, Murray has, for example, a charity boxing game.
Even so, he doesn't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's getting into the boat basically with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, admitted Bond, who also demonstrated at the press conference that Murray is the dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to answer, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
However, they destroy their opponents with a calm force.
They drive their pace, and although they are often not at the forefront of the track, their gradual acceleration has not yet been found by the opponents.
We're running on a two-mile line, and we never wanted to ride the first mile in time.
We're just trying to drive the pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said 40-year-old Murray.
He won seven gold medals at the World Cup with his four years younger partner.
They even triumphed in 2007 when they were both members of the gold four without a steering wheel.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to move to a double without the helmsman.
At the London Olympics, apparently the biggest defeat of their careers they've made, and they've confirmed the dominance in Rio as well.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask questions.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was gonna be fucking hard, and we had to make sure we were doing it mentally well, said Murray.
We all know they want us off the throne.
The target's still on our backs.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a resident
According to the projections of the new NASA climate model, Venus was once a resident.
The scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus using instruments and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether, once on Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water and through carbon dioxide could have been conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of Venus rotation can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus once seemed proud of a thin atmosphere similar to the Earth while turning slowly.
The model also dealt with earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet, the areas were probably drier than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used the sun earlier, which was 30 percent more dampened.
“In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during slow rotation, it exposes its daily side to the sun almost two months at a time,” explained the GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in the new report.
In this way, the surface is heated and the rain creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like an umbrella and the surface is sealed against excessive solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than on Earth at present.
The model built a story of Venus similar to evolution, which was previously hypotheticalally compiled by planetary scientists.
Even though Venus was probably a resident in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapours burned with ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped and only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the fatal effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned to the post of coach of the Colorado Avalanche team
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned to his post as a coach and vice-president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey team, as a reason he stated the inability to participate in the decision-making process on team issues.
The Executive Vice President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the step and stated that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the last three years I have acted as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
Over the years, I've been thinking about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey operations be consistent with the organisation's vision.
They must also be able to participate in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, adopted by Roye on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his team's benefits.
“Patrick informed me of his decision today,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
The team has led to a profit of 112 points and the first place in Central Division. Colorado has been struggling with Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and has always failed in the last two years after the season.
Avalanche team in 2015/2016 scored 39:39:4 and missed five points to get the second wild card in the Western Conference.
The brother Roy, who joined the Hall of Glory, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Oil platform workers in the North Sea renew interviews and interrupt strike
The leaders of the negotiating parties stated that the strike on wages for oil platform workers in the North Sea was interrupted, while all parties to the dispute had come to a new round of negotiations.
The attacks against the Wood Group oil field service company occurred occasionally on the North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Union Organisations Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for solving current disagreements,” says the statement.
Starting next week, we will have a series of day-to-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade union organisations, their recent actions, which, according to their words, have been the first in more than 25 years, to protest wage cuts by up to 30 percent.
Wood Group reduced its rates this year and paid off its North Sea suppliers about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would provide the company with space to cope with a market decline.
On the other hand, Shell cut thousands of people out of his payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries for modernization of his processes - immediately after the mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June decision of Britain to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders to discuss one of the greatest working disagreements of the whole generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as it said, is vital for the economy in the region.
“In the North Sea and the whole country, we need an economy that works for all, not just for some,” he said.
For comparison, in 2016, almost $1.4 billion of investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected, while the average over the past five years has been around 7 billion dollars.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's space telescope to help astronomers is to obtain a nearly complete list of speeds of rotation of the stars from the Pleiades constellation.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster are turning at different speeds, as well as how the time of rotation is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star matter, its age and even its history in its solar system," she said in her new report by Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the centre of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades Starship is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and have been created for over 125 million years.
Now it's turning fast.
In moments of maximum rotation, these teen stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the way the star gets older, its speed of rotation is slowing down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star so that it measures the time between discovering discernible points on the stars -- similar to sunlight.
According to the latest data on rotation speeds, larger stars are turning slower than less massive stars.
Rebulla compares the stars to the dancers, the larger they make the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
“In the “ballet” Pleiades we see that slower turning stars are more massive, while those turning faster are usually very light stars,” Rebulla said.
Because the cluster of Pleiad is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of the stars and speed of rotation.
“Pleasures provide an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in both younger and older stars,” Rebulla said.
There's still a lot we want to know about when, when, and why stars slow down their speed of rotation, and so they say, "hang their dance shoes on the nail".
Rebulla and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of Pleiad rotation rates in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomic Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then the qualification agreement wouldn't have been concluded, and after a few months, I could have gone to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work without signing up for specialization training?
My point is that in the field where I would like to work, there is now a job available only in a slightly more remote hospital, but about six months from now, there could be a place where I would like to work.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation about half a year, the question goes on.
Replys to Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - hospitals.
The qualification agreement shall be the legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the return of the incurred costs associated with the increase or deepening of the staff member's qualifications.
In the field of health, long-term pressure is being put in place not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the mobility of health workers and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
In accordance with Act No 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional qualifications and specialised competence for the exercise of the medical profession, dental practitioner and pharmacist, it is expressly true that participation in specialization training is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not to increase it).
This means that the qualification agreement can only be concluded according to the Labour Code if the costs are at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation or obligation to apply for specialisation training.
The law only lays down the conditions for an application for specialisation training.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to carry out a doctor’s profession already because he has completed the required university degree, even if under the conditions laid down by law (under the professional supervision of a physician with specialised competence in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation where the doctor’s specialization training can be counted on the professional experience acquired in another field of specialization, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant training programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the questionable situation.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know the closer circumstances of this case, consultation with the relevant Department of Health (the Department of Science and Medicine) can be recommended, as the Ministry of Health provides advisory and advisory services related to the inclusion and conduct of specialisation education.
The advisory service also provides the Czech Medical Chamber free of charge, each of which must be a doctor.
The doctors in the Syrian Halaba are asking for an intervention from the United States.
The United States has not made any effort to put an end to the siege (the insurgent part of the city by government) and have not used its influence to enforce civil protection, quoted AFP from a letter addressed to the White House.
"We do not need tears, compassion, nor even prayers; but desperately we need to create a flightless zone over East Halab to stop attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again," the doctors said.
The Russian forces that support the military loyal President Bashar Assad have announced that they will stop hitting Halab every day for three hours to allow safe passage to humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 SELČ are to be stopped all military activities, air attacks and artillery fire.
While welcoming this, the UN Chief of Humanitarian Operations Stephen O'Brien stressed that at least a two-day truce was needed.
According to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who operate in the eastern part of Halab were already in control of the rebels.
He writes that during the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel death of countless patients, friends, and colleagues.
The world observes and notes how difficult Syria is, but it does little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation from the Syrian regime, and Russia sounds like only a slightly focused threat, were made by pediats, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors have stated that 42 attacks have been reported in the past month on medical facilities in Syria, 15 of which have been reported to hospitals in which they work.
The sad thing is that we have to decide who lives and dies.
We have children coming to the emergency room with such severe injuries that we must choose among them those most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the material we need to help them, describe the doctors.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when an explosion interrupted the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They lay low and then their lives were over - before he could really start, they reminded.
The army loyal to President Bashar Assad, supported by the Russian forces, surrounded the rebels in the eastern part of Halab in the last few weeks, with no food supply of over 200,000 people.
On Saturday, after three weeks, the rebels, who are under constant blows of the Russian and Syrian air force, managed to break through and launch a counter-opensive.
The two sides then added reinforcements to the city and its surroundings.
