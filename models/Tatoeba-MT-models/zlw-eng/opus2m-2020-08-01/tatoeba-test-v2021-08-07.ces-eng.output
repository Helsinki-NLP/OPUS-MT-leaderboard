According to the Teeba directives, it is recommended that members should either add sentences in their native language or translate from a language they understand, into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to fold naturally sounding sentences in their native language. When we write in a language other than the native one, it is very easy to create sentences that sound strangely. Please translate the sentence only if you know for sure what it means.
