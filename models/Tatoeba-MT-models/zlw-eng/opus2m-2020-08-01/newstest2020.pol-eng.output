Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in the white satin
He's a charismatic.
For his holy Mass for release and healing, the crowds are drawn up.
He was several years old when things began to be inexplicable in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience this.
Fr Witko's mass for release and healing brings together the crowds
Once upon a time, the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a 7-month-old hole in her heart.
It was supposed to be operated.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
The same day the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
The amazing doctors have said: “Operation is not necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm”.
My parents cried for happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
A spiritual, unusual act of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.
In his dreams purgatory souls came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at a given moment – he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what was happening to a man who committed a mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost human qualities, and I started to take the look of the animal," he says.
The invisible force carried him up, couldn't pull him out of his voice.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
"In the waters of the river symbolizing the baptism, I was released and returned to the human being..." he says.
He didn't tell anyone about the strange experiences.
He grew up with a vocation.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In the sermons, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Renewal Community in the Holy Spirit
Many people who count on getting rid of the disease are attending the Mass about the healing of Father Witko.
However, the clergyman stresses that their main goal is spiritual healing, not fleshly healing.
First failure of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today's (September 26th), the Kolping team FRAC deserved to be the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodowiesk Mazowiecki in the 3rd round of the lotto Superliga Tenisa Table.
Jaroslavians in such a personal set as they have presented with the bulkheads have little chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
He really showed this duel with Dartom Bogoria.
There's still no team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps a third of the triumphs of the new season would reach with him in the line of the year.
The young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet come to win with the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Siruck.
Not even with one of the most forward-looking Poles, Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellady was the biggest player in the MOSiR Hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosław.
Both in the battle with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for himself.
After three singles, Kolping FRAC ran 2:1.
Kou Lei probably won Mark Badowski and Daniel Górak after an emotional, five hundredth battle – Pavel Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
One could still hope for a win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not match Badowski.
There won't be any more tests for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafał Trzzaskowski's predictions, a program of free prophylactic studies for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and the subject of the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tarification.
In the explanatory statement, the agency explained that the target group had been badly selected.
"In fact, greater effects may result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of the difficulties in accessing NFZs and have a negative impact on the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive results of the studies", it is written.
The Ministry's decisions do not understand the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we’ve predicted it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are tested, they will later go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it is just about leading to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that this helps with the burden on the health system, because it helps to quickly detect diseases and in a sound approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand", said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"I can hardly imagine that expert experts say, "Let's not examine ourselves because there will be longer queues with a doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that there is a health service in this condition," said the PO.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break up any agreement we have so far
The Palestinian President Mahmud Abas announced at the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements with Israel if the future government of this country tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the Palestinianic land's occupation.
"If the future government of Israel, as it will arise, will implement this plan, we will invalidate all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments," he announced.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely", he threatened with the pressure of Abas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights with all possible means, which are of little importance as to the consequences – by being fully involved in the application of international law and the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanjahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, was once again given a government-forming mission after the elections of 17 September.
The week before the elections, he announced that if he had won it, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and would include all the Jewish settlements in Israel all over the West Bank.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements that the United States had patronised.
During the session of the UN General Assembly, the 84-year-old Abbass also promised that the Palestinian general elections would be held on the ground.
The last one took place in 2006.
"When I return to the country, I will call on the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, the local elections and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," declared the Palestinian President.
He also defended the rights of Palestine, a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the powers of "the full-time members of the UN and of all its bodies and institutions".
The Palestinian leader ended the speech by calling on the international community to "include Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations".
Israel’s ambassador Danny Danon replied briefly to the address by saying that the Palestinian leader “will be willing to focus on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel rather than to fight against the calls for terrorism in Autonomy under his leadership”.
Danon, as the agencies note, did not, however, refer to the annexation of the Palestinian land occupied by Netanjahu.
The rescuers want defibrillators at the newralgic points of Przemyśl.
The history of the border crossing shows that the AED automatic defibrillator can save human lives.
Military Emergency Emergency Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be located in the city's sensitive points.
For their posture, the officers received congratulations from the Voivodship Emergency Station in Przemyśl.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackian Customs Office in Industry.
On August 28 they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyka.
The Chinese activist died of torture in custody.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
To Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, called on the Communist Secretary of September 23 from her home village to announce that her husband just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
Which was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
In the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body slaughtered, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood,” says the woman.
"They wouldn't let me take my cell phone with them, and there were a lot of cops around them who didn't get close to Wang."
The police pressured her to sign a statement saying that her husband was seriously ill and died of a "unfortunate accident."
PLN 105 million for video games companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will reach companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced on Friday the results of the 3rd edition of GameINN.
Almost 30 projects supported by the NCBR include, among other things, the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on the AR engine creating a real-world map with an application for data transmission by users; a test-training platform to verify practical skills in the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game to stimulate the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on virtual world interaction with the real world using the concept of industry 4.0 – set out in the NBBR Communication sent on Friday PAP.
The objective of the GameINN Sectoral Programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video gamer sector on the global market in 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video games market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion and the forecast for 2019 was PLN 2.23 billion.
"A specially prepared research agenda for GameINN and already PLN 300 million for entrepreneurs in this sector program provide an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev", says the Communication.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the efficient use of the potential we have in Poland.
“The government’s incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R & D reliefs, competence enhancement programmes, IP boxing and support programmes implemented by the NCBR drive innovative companies and allow them to compete more effectively on a very competitive market,” says the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The Head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovation not only comes to innovators in the form of project funding but also remains in their pockets – three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R & D relief in 2018 than in the previous year.
"The amount of deducted costs for R & D activities was PLN 1.7 billion, resulting in over PLN 300 million savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three editions of GameINN", stresses the Deputy Prime Minister.
The director of the NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki recalls that in the two previous competitions more than PLN 211.2 million was awarded to 78 innovative projects.
The huge interest of the III competition and the diversity of applications show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“It is particularly pleased that projects, as in previous editions, have been selected for entertainment solutions, not only as well as industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition for funding of up to PLN 20 million, entrepreneurs could apply, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units.
The NCBR received 87 applications for the total amount of funding of about PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time the contest was announced was PLN 100 million, but was increased and 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million.
Detailed information on the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN Sectoral Programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
The NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes, among others, CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloomer Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
It happened on September 16th.
Dolberg, who, at the end of August, went from Ajaksu Amsterdam to Nice, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not just what, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
An angry Danish didn't show up for class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
The case has been mysterious since the beginning.
The footballers in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, he finally confessed to theft of Diaby-Fadiga.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Dane the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most forward-looking footballers of the young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a 13-year-old to debut on the first team three years later.
He played seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – as the newspaper “L’Equipe” said – the club is likely to solve it with immediate effect.
So far, he's opened a discipline against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this.
See if you wash your hands properly.
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are coming.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
Most of us wash them short.
Just warm water and ordinary soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise them away).
When washing, we wipe not only the bottom and the top of our hands, but also: finger ends (connected or individually) – wipe them with circular moves with the inside of the other hand, the spaces between your fingers (swipe your hands, wiping your fingers against yourself), thumbs – each thumb includes the other hand and in such a cover we spin a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency (when you cannot wash your hands) you should wipe your hands with a wet handkerchief and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from PLN 5).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the wash-out handle or door handle (Recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it through the paper towel.
The President of Iran says he has rejected the U.S. call, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not discuss with the American party during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the offer made by the Americans to abolish the sanctions, he said on Friday the President of Iran Hasan Rowhani.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, commented that it was the Iranian party that asked for the removal of restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to the President of Iran, Hasan Rowhani, the Americans proposed the abolition of all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for the negotiation of a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear programme and its ballistic missiles programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not talk in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran stated that he did not agree to these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He declared that he had met American diplomats because he had been led by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not hold talks in the atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1 format, no one is able to predict what the final result would be," Rowhani said.
A day earlier, the Iranian leader said that he did not exclude talks with the US, and that the European parties to the nuclear agreement had rejected the promotion of American sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran following the US's speech from the nuclear agreement "are a prerequisite that does not allow" to establish a dialogue.
If we can put an end to this pre-condition and if America can endure sanctions and maximum pressure, then, of course, we can talk to America – he declared.
He added that he did not exclude a meeting with President Donald Trump, although he did not agree to this conversation in the weeks passed during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he was the one who rejected the request from the Iranian party.
“Iran wanted me to endure the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said 'no!' was tweeted by the President of the United States.
The voltage with the atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to mitigate the tension between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the agreement with Iran in 2015, which they were signatories.
It stated that in exchange for the abolition of economic sanctions, Iran would give up its nuclear weapons programme and the nuclear sector would be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to maintain the agreement.
Nothing's worked out so far.
Washington uses maximum pressure tactics on Iran, and sanctions also include full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran announced that if he did not receive an export permit for raw material, every 60 days he would limit his obligations under the agreement.

According to her words and screens from WhatsApp, the judge of the Military Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the queen of Emilia, who participated in the stalkering of judges, was reinstated by the NSA on Wednesday.
The reason: there is no disciplinary proceedings against him, so there is no basis to maintain the order of President Wojciech Mazur to withdraw him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesperson at the NSA, opened an investigation against Smydt at the end of August, but it has not so far turned into an act against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must take the decision of the President of the NSA within one month of its issue.
In this situation, a judge who publicly talked about his wife's mental problems to discredit her, who, due to suspicions of participation in the Herterian group, has been removed from the KRS office, will return to judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Smydt is denying his share in the Heathing Group.
He claims there's no evidence except for the falsified screens and the words of his wife that he's divorcing.
That's exactly what the other judges say about the Casta: they're all innocent, there's no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they'll bet on their own.
Because the D.A. didn't give a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it also kept quiet about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone that kept the phone in June on another matter.
The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of those whom Judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out as persecutors in a report from February.
There is no evidence - no case of Smydt, no case of Casta.
There is also no case with the head of NIK Marian Banasia about renting a basement house and hiding income.
CBA's checking his property statements.
And he'll check when he's done.
The Committee on Ethical Ethical Banasi will not take care of it, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee on State Control has somehow come together to take a specific decision on the appeal of the Deputy Banasus and the appointment as his lawyer, although the law of such a strange combination does not provide).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, American, I think, about when my wife comes home and sets up a husband with a lover in bed.
She's so astonished and devastated, she can't say a word.
She's standing in the door, and at that time, the lover jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And my husband made the bed.
When the wife gets her voice back and screams, "What is it?"
Who is this woman?
My husband says, "What woman, baby?"
Only about Casta or Banasia there's a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the final jump higher
Previously, in this season, the brown medalist of the World Championships from London 2017 won 1.85 and 1.89 and the second 1.92.
1.94 was only obtained in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely failed.
In the finals I will have to jump better technically", she admitted before the camera Eurosport Lićwinko.
Vashti Cunningham and Belarus’s Demidik – after 1.94 – turned out to be the best.
The two players were the only ones who cut off any height.
The women's jump finale was scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7.30 Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in a hospital in severe condition
He hit the hospital, and the doctors call his condition heavy.
You have to say, he's conscious and conscious.
"We believe that he will succeed once more.
We all pray that he will recover," said an anonymous person close to Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with journalists of "Super Expressu".
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
"I am kept alive by the closest family and politics", said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview, which he gave to journalists "Super Express" two weeks ago.
In January "Super Express" reported that the 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki was admitted to the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and applied to the hospital.
I think I've got a jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When a C.T. scan was performed, it was found that I had a cancer of the pancreas...", the Prime Minister's father passed on.
A few days later, at the MSWIA hospital in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki had a serious operation.
As Morawiecki told, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know many people prayed for me for what I thank you so much for.
Fortunately, I don't think I have much of a metastasis.
I don't know if I'm going through chemotherapy yet.
I'm putting myself in the hands of specialists who are rather good thoughts.
For now, after this heavy operation, I have to go back to some kind of utility condition.
I hope that everything will be fine," Kornel Morawiecki said in his interview with the "SE" in January.
"If I had been too late to give up my research, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to this villain...", I added.

Power of the Oval jumps.
The title of the amateur sports competitions, held on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the hypodrome of Oleandra Street in Oława, may be misleading for some.
To the true power of the way is far away, but that is what one of the kinds of horse rivalry is called...
The power contest of jumps consists in overcoming the rider and horse of ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two metres.
It is worth adding that the long and still unbroken record of the world, established in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the "Huaso" horse, is 247 cm.
Of course, no one jumped so high in Olava, but the result of the best local amazons at 135 cm or the worst ones...
The competitions organised by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other CJKS activists “In the saddle” were a part of the previously held “Tęczowy jezdců” there, which we write more about in this newspaper, on page 22.
The competition was followed by eight amazons, training riding in the JKS Oława region.
Four were competing for ponies and four were on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Sóldra was best placed to join the crazy "Sprinter".
This small, yet dynamic rumac began by crossing obstacles of 40 cm high, and it ended only at the station with the upper beam from the ground by 125 cm.
However, it was easy to give up and only after three subsequent refusals was the jury dismissed from further competition.
The second place in ponie jumps took Amelia Pawlak, taking "Famy", and the third place Lena Borun on "Harmider".
The youngest participant of the Inga Aksman tournament fought ambitiously, gazing and jumping through obstacles to the small Carmen mare.
Even greater emotions were accompanied by starting amazons and viewers during the competition with large horses.
The dangerous-looking downfalls included Paulina Szewczyk, who joined the "declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who went on "Lotka".
Fortunately, except for minor injuries or amazons or horses, nothing bad happened, so they continued to participate in the competition.
There were many problems with the introduction of the young "Wineta" mare on the park, which included Veronika Łukkiewicz.
She needed either an assist coach or another horse for a couple behind which she got a little crazy "Winta".
After counting the obstacles from the park she also went down with full respect, so the moments in the boxing rooms and the relaxation rooms were becoming dangerous. “All is under control!” Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down some of these frightened viewers, especially the youngest ones.
Since the beginning of the big horse competition, Martha Masalska has done great in the park, which has been taking part in a beautiful presentation of "Whisky".
This dignified mare, together with an experienced amazon, followed the second approach in the final phase first jumped 135 cm and it was the best result at this point.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk also included the same height on the “declaration”, Veronika Łukkiewicz on the “Winet” and Anastasia Abramko on the “Letka”.
For the decoration of flo and after receiving in-kind prizes in the form of riding equipment, all these players went away together, and at the end together with the amazons on the ponies in the march of Radecki performed an effective round of honor, ending with these interesting and emotional competitions.
Thank you
The U.S. Sports Club "In Siodle" warmly thanks the sponsors of the jump contest during the XVI "Tęczowy Jędzeckich prosadów": the Municipal Office in Oława, the Waterworks and Canaling Department in Oława, the District Mayor and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko is cut off from the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the #R Revolution of Marius Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution was directed in particular to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Koloko announced his cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Pavel Kukiz, but none of these coalitions occurred, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko could not even collect enough signatures to display lists in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko reported on Twitter that he ended his cooperation with the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will expect my name to be deleted from the KWW.
Please do not associate my person with the mentioned entity", he added and announced that he will give more information soon.
For now, it is not known whether the journalist will continue his action, whether it is the end of the formation #R Revolution.
On July 4th, on the US Independence Day, a journalist, Mariusz Max Kolonko, reported the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has been famous for driving the Max TV channel on YouTube, which comments on events in Poland and the world.
"We are sick of politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the government in the country to take over the nation and rule for the benefit of the nation," said Koloko.
In the programme of the party there are, among other things, questions concerning the judiciary (it should be chosen in the general elections), tax changes (a comparison of the amount of tax free for all), war reparations (in the form of military assistance for the eastern NATO flannel, with particular regard to Poland), the holding of a referendum on possession of weapons, the reduction of Members' numbers or the introduction of single-mandate electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the talks with Marek Jakubiak.
By the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his profile in social media suggesting that #R would combine forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions have finally occurred.
UBS: Golden near the balance point
"The euro will continue in the coming months around the ceiling of 4.35 zł, which will be accompanied by a weak economic situation on global markets", said Michael Bolliger with UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilising gold quotations on the current ceiling", says Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite clear inflationary pressures, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise its rates in a climate where the vast majority of central banks ease politics.
"As long as the gold is properly valued, the euro should remain in the vicinity of 4.35 zł in the coming months – so few Polish bonds are attractive.
Much more profitable profitability from Polish securities offer bonds from emerging markets", says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets in UBS Wealth Management.
According to a specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the economic situation in the world.
"Global slowdown may go even further, but there should not be a severe recession, and at the most, a GDP dynamic of less than zero," said Michael Bolliger.
"Investors should underweight global actions which could harm the lack of prospects for a solution to the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump impeachment and Brett.
Among the shares markets, Europe should behave the most relatively low", results from the latest letter to investors by the lead manager of UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele.
"The euro-area shares should be worse off than the US, because they are more vulnerable to increased uncertainty about global trade and fear of slowdown," says the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hoss in the bond markets of the safest countries, the profitability of German 10-year-olds even increased to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decrease in profitability.
However, the long-term viability of long-term securities should no longer fall in the long-term, but only short-term, by easing the bank’s monetary policy.
The largest area to the reduction of the feet is Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the horizon of the years to come.
The long-term balance for euro quotations is a ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean a 19% potential for strengthening the single currency to the dollar.
We expect a further reduction in the Fed's rates, which will lead to a decline in the world's monetary policy differences.
"The dollar's long-term deficits may not allow the dollar to remain in the current and budgetary account", said Michael Bolliger.
Bundeswehra is losing his gun.
Confidential report from the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, Bundeswehr has noted the disappearance of 39 arms, 39 arms parts and 19,445 ammunition, resulting from a confidential statement drawn up in the RFN Defence Ministry.
The information was provided by media press EditorialsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a paper from the parliamentary office of the State Secretary at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapons and 3474 ammunition have been re-detected.
Among the military equipment still missing are six multi-purpose MG3, 11 automatic G3, four automatic G36 rifles, six signal guns and two P8 P8 pistols.
In addition, a 30 barrel for MG3 machine guns is missing.
The concern was expressed by the vice-president of the Levic party, Martin Renner.
As she told the press, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "resisting".
More so, only a small portion of the lost equipment was found as a result of the investigations.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these activities as "poor balance sheet".
She also criticised the fact that it does not appear from the list that there is also a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehry Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and of violating the laws governing access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians from extreme right-wing and racist motives.
His "black list" of objectives, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor, included, among others, the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, Human Rights Defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegally in possession of four units of firearms, over 1000 units of ammunition and over 50 explosives.
Crying kids on a plane.
How to avoid them?
There's a solution.
The carrier Japan Airlines has recently used a function designed for people for whom traveling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website of the line, they allow you to check the timetable of the seats on the plane.
If a particular combination travels to the second year of age, then the "concerning of the child" appears on a specific, reserved by parents or carers of the seat.
Thus, a person using the services of the carrier has the possibility to choose a place away from the one occupied by the little one.
The BBC reports that the lines have already reported the failures of this solution.
"Children icon" does not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a change of aircraft at the last moment.
As expected, he divided the idea of Internet users.
Some Twitter users indicate that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids. We used to be kids.
"We need to learn tolerance because we will soon need maps of places that sit breathing, drool or drunkards," G Sundar wrote.
Another intern noticed that he used to be disturbed by crying kids on the plane, but changed his mind when he became his own parent.
There is also a lack of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me about the screaming children during the 13 hour journey," Rahat Ahmed wrote.
The Major counts losses after bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive on vacation in October to Majorca as a result of the bankruptcy announced by Thomas Cook travel agency on Monday.
On Friday, a representative of the Autonomous Government of the Balearic Marc Pons, among 25 thousand holidaymakers who will not be able to take October leave in Majorca, there are also those who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of expected holidaymakers, who, due to the failure of the UK company, had to give up their vacation in Majorca next month are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.
However, as Pons says, as Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island during November-April, the loss to the local economy will be reduced.
He revealed that the Balearic government had already opened negotiations with international operators on the “entering the Majorca” market after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to estimates from the Diario de Mallorca newspaper, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.
About 800 are off-limits to Thomas Cook's office in Palmia.
The others will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy announcement in many hotels, Majors property owners requested additional accommodation fees from guests.
This situation has been experienced, among others, by dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, several dozen hotels in the Major have stopped working at least until the end of October in connection with Thomas Cook's bankruptcy announcement and the cooperating companies.
On the other hand, the Friday newspaper Diario de Ibiza shows that the majority of hotels operating in Ibiza, which worked with Thomas Cook, are not intended to close the facilities in the coming weeks.
The paper reminds us that on this ballerina island, the British bankrut co-operated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish Government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy announcement by Thomas Cook's travel agency.
They revealed that the most vulnerable tourists, some 36,000, are in the Majorca.
According to the Balearic government data, Thomas Cook is behind local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of the agreements for the July-September 2019 period of around EUR 5 million.
FIFA Women's rating.
Poland still in the 29th place, USA at the lead
The woman's representation of Poland takes 29th place in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of Coach Miłosz Stępiński was classified in the previous July set.
Poor staff games.
How will it be in October?
The leaders of the remaining American women who have recently won the title of world champion.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, and the third place was held by the Dutch.
The Polish are preparing for the ME qualification.
They were supposed to start with a trip match with Cheszek on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting was passed by one year due to food poisoning.
In this situation, the Polish will launch a qualified meeting with the Spanish on 12 November in Lublin.
Before that, the White and Red will play two social matches – October 3 on the way out of Cyprus and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
The Polek rival groups represent Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The winners of the groups and the three best teams from the second places advance directly to the final tournament.
The other six teams from the second position will play in the marshes by the last three passes to the European Championships.
The rate of 16 participants will be complemented by the host – England.
The men's representation of Poland in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd.
"Rz": Smog nailed the government
"The "Clean Air" results are low, and the coal furnaces will be digging as if nothing happened this winter," we read on the front page of today's "Rzeczpospolita".
So far, 82 000 applications for funding amounting to PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the Clean Air programme, of which 48 000 have been positive.
Accepted applications amount to more than PLN 915 million, says "Rz", referring to data from the spokesperson of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred is recovered from the programme.
The results of the announced noise program are considered "smoky".
Self-government, quoted by "Rz", is looking for failures of the "Pure Air" among others in too much bureaucracy.
"The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by post, possible random monitoring of implementation.
This would make things easier", says Mayor of Warminski Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog alert note that less than 1% of the planned 3 million mowing boilers were implemented in the first year.
As the "Rz" notes, although the budget of the programme is PLN 103 billion per 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Fund for the Environment and Water Management for this year, PLN 1.4 billion has been reserved," we read.
Congress agrees with F-35 for Poland
Coat: Now Negotiations Prices
The US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 of the state-of-the-art aircraft F-35.
“This is one of the last steps before the contract is concluded, but it is not the end of our work”, wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the most favourable price”, added the Polish minister.
The agreement for the Polish F-35
The Polish air force is powered by 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters manufactured by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, Poland agreed to their sale by the U.S. Department of State.
The Communication underlines that investment will support national security and US foreign policy by improving the security of NATO's ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to information from the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also cover the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, the execution of engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of support for logistics and programme and training of personnel.
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter
The F-35 Lightning II fighter, produced by Lockheed Martin, is a single and single-engine fighter of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out a mission close to support, bombing and typically hunting air combat tasks.
The use of Stealth Fighter technology makes it undetectable for short-range radars.
A recent F-35 fighter bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace them with an ageing F-16.
The purchase of American combat aircraft is also intended to consider other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The Barbie manufacturer has introduced a series of sexually neutral dolls.
This is how he wants to fight stereotypes.
Barbie manufacturer has introduced a series of sexually neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie, with different skin colors, figures or hairstyles, Mattel introduced a sexually neutral doll.
Toys from the "Creatable World" series wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe is made up of both pants and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in various skin colors and with different clothes.
It has also given up emphasis on the characteristic gender characteristics – gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and a thin deck or – in the case of Ken – broad arms.
The company thinks that children don't like their dolls having sexual standards imposed, and some parents and feminists believe that toys made for the sake of particular sex inhibit the ambition of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"New dolls will allow all children to feel free," Mattel said.
Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a high-end bathing suit and shoes, has in the past been repeatedly criticised for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as an unnatural body proportion.
The group has responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls with different skin colors and more rounded shapes to the market.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: wheel or club Together can have several Members
Zandberg asked on the ZET radio, how many candidates of his party can get to Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the candidates for SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo “Lewica”), replied that it depends on the outcome of the committee.
"I believe that the Left's result will be very good, because we feel that people are bound to hope that the Left is not only right, but also strong," he said.
According to Zandberg, the left hand can have 60-80 Members.
“This may mean that the circle or the Club Together will have several Members.
But it depends on the Pole and the Poles.
I'm not going to guess and tell you how it's going to happen," he said.
Asked whether Levica Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed to be diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity is not there.
I think that the diversity of Poles has been rewarded because we have shown that we were able to agree on a common agenda by different means."
The question of whether the largest beneficiary of the joint launch was the leader of SLD Włodzimierz Czarzysty, Zandberg replied that he considered that the largest beneficiaries were the centrolic and left-wing voters.
On the other hand, he said that the SLD would get all the subsidy, saying that "the objective of the political party is to represent its voters".
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the Sejm elections.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he pointed out that he was wondering.
“The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to which my heart is further,” he said.
"On the other hand, I would say very honestly and clearly that if I had been in Senate District 44, I would have taken a electoral certificate and voted in another district," stressed politicians.
“I suppose I would not be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujdowski (KO - PAP)” he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, Polish citizens Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are starting.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, by car and by foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque was built, which could accommodate 30,000 believers.
The building was built by the Mouride fraternity, belonging to Sufi's Islam, which dominates in Senegal.
Work on the mosque started ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares, transmitted by the government.
The name of the Mosque of Massalikul Jinin ("The Path to Paradise") comes from the title of Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, worshiped by the believers as saints.
The Mosque is surrounded by Carrar marble and has five minarets.
The highest is 78 meters.
The Mosque in the middle will hold 15 thousand believers, and the other will be on the outer Esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decoration by hand made by the Moroccan workers.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but there is no comparison between the mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can hold 105,000 believers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed by private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, provided lighting, sanitary equipment and funded road works worth EUR 10,5 million.
Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, we alone
A pass of eight league matches without winning the Korona football team will try to stop in a Friday meeting with Śląski's vice-president.
“Our problem is not to turn back, but we ourselves, we must work on what we play,” stressed Coach Mirosław Smyła.
The last Corona footballers and, so far, the only victory in the league was recorded in the first round when they defeated the 1-0 Bianca of the game of Raków Częstochowa on the way out.
Later, the sausages recorded two drawbacks and six failures, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with Zadrzeją Lubin in 1/32 finale of the Polish Cup.
“I am so optimistic that in the last few seconds the football players have fought for the goal, they have tried to redecorate.
Their fall into the mural after the last whistle did not result from a breakdown, only it was a fall of anger, because they were so close," Smyła said.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will be allergic to playing in the later sectors of the field.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play”, added the coach.
In a Friday match in Koron, he will certainly not play a break for too many yellow cards of Ogjen Gnjatic, but also the injured James Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski will not play.
However, it is up to us to sign up for a championship match with a few players with the pleasure of the game.
"We have a headache recently seemed to be gone, and now it is," said Smyła.
The defenseman of the Crown Daniel Strangel stressed that Silesia would not be an easy rival to break the eight league matches in a row without a win, but in an extraclass, everyone could win with everyone.
"We're a good team.
In the last few weeks we may not show it on the field, but this moment will come that we will win and we believe it will be on Friday", the footballer noted.
After nine lines, the Korona extract with a total of five points takes 15.
The Śląsk gathered 12 more and ranked in second place.
The fifth match in Kielce will start at 8.30 p.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
"42% of the tree species of Europe are at risk", warns the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUCN) in the "Red Book of European Trees" on Friday.
The list is headed by chestnut and berry.
IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was drawn up by experts who, on the basis of research, concluded that 42% of the 454 species of trees in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) are "at high risk".
Among the causes of the Red Paper, there is a rapid increase in urban agglomeration and global climate change.
However, the most vulnerable are those trees and bushes that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As far as typical European woodland is concerned, according to IUCN experts 58% of species are at risk and 15 percent of species, 66 species of trees and bushes, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of the Red Paper's deforestation are errors in the exploitation of woodwood, accelerated urbanization, too intensive tree cutting, and subsequently forest fires and changes occurring in the European ecostym.
According to the authors of the report, there is also a strong threat to the existence of many European varieties of bushes, moss and growths.
"The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and create a danger of extinction of important and underrated varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet", summarizes the report by Luc Bas, which runs the European Office IUCN.
Grzegorz Schemeina: I won't promise 600+
"Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles, offering them freedom of distribution for credit that will have to pay off future generations," says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for "Rzeczpospolita".
In his opinion, "the whole policy of PiS is a pic".
At the same time, politicians promise that "what is given will not be taken away".
The scheme assures Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea of defeating the Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the electoral urn.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential than the Kaczyński party.
“Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal country are more than the supporters of the PiS, a party that has embezzled the declared values, such as modesty, humility, transparency,” says Schethina.
The Leader of the Civil Coalition and the Chairman of the Civil Platform also highlighted the basic principles of the KO electoral programme.
"First of all, nothing that is given will be taken, but we need to set a course for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investment," he said.
Secondly, it is about "starting the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work honestly - and those who are entrepreneurs".
Schetyna explains that in the program KO there was a project, which the least earning Poles will give more 614 zlotys on hand and more earners – also a few hundred.
The politician also pointed out that he didn't want to race for distribution.
As he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers auctioned with the opposition to the distribution, until the financial collapse of the country finally occurred," he stressed.
In his interview with "Rz", he also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki were afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would reveal their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“The pride goes before the fall.
Kaczyński is a state husband like Banas is crystal," he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether he would apply for the leadership of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Great Condors Dead
In the province of Santa Cruz, six dead large candors were found in Argentina – says TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Large condors were probably poisoned with a means to kill predators such as pumas, foxes, and wild dogs.
The animals could have had toxic spatula.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead Condors were adults.
"This is a great loss for the environment, because the Condor must reach 10-15 years in order to become fruitful and capable of reproduction.
So we lose protected species, endangered species", says Luis Jacome, Director of BioAndina Foundation, Argentine environmental organisation.
"I think that using toxic bait and poison will not only put this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
"Rz": They want the President's jewel
Work on the award of the head of the precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda's office – we read in "Rzeczpospolita".
As the newspaper explains, it is the gold chain of the White Eagle Order, the royal insignium officially known as the interwar jewel of the Republic.
He's probably been used by President Ignacy Mostecki for the last time.
"Rz" says that soon such a chain can hit Andrzej Duda's shoulders.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday for work on the amendment of the Act on Orders and Awards to restore it.
The journal says that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain of heads of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost in one vote.
This time, the work is lightning.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to finding the opinion of the President's Office.
This one came in mid-September.
“I would like to inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position put forward in this petition,” said Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate Commission continued to devote little time to the case.
"The President's office answered us briefly: it is to restore this," said the head of the committee Robert Mamątov of PiS, quoted by "Rz".
He put forward a proposal for legislative work which the committee supported.
Cops will teach drivers how to drive through the crossroads
The police action will be conducted, among others, at the intersection of Al. Ciepliński of Al. Piłsudski.
Uniform action has, as a matter of fact, been linked to recent complaints by the city authorities to drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the crossroads.
On Friday, September 27th, the police begin their preventive action in the Reich on Passing Crossroads.
The aim is to eliminate obstacles to traffic: access to a crossroads without the possibility of a downhill, non-compliance with light signals or road signs.
"We often think we're alone at the crossroads, and we're actually making life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobiński, vice president of the city a few days ago.
His words spoke at a press conference of the City Hall, where the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars at the intersections, which in effect creates traffic jams.
At that time, the President appealed to travelers for reason on the road and, among other things, faster movement on the lights or not texting while driving.
The theme was taken over by the Rzeszów policemen, who are starting today with the action "Radio Crossroads".
What is it?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of the reduction of traffic at the crossings of drivers entering without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a frequent offence that contributes to the exacerbation of traffic difficulties and the creation of traffic jams.
It shall be threatened by a mandate of PLN 300 and 2 points of criminal law.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs, and incorrect parking in the crossroads area.
They will also observe lack of fluidity of driving, late movement from signals, free crossings and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
What crossroads will action be carried out?
M.in. na ul. Lisa-Kuli z ul. Jagiellonska; al. Ciepliński z al. Piłsudskiego; Targowa street from Al. Piłsudski; Śreńwitów Square from Dąbrowski Street and Hetmanska Street from the Warsaw Uprisings.
Such shares in the capital of Podkarpacia will be carried out on the next five October.
They checked the company that used the "Cza" waste.
"The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the District of Wołominski and the District of Construction Supervisory Inspection checked on Friday the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the water treatment plant "Czaka" in Warsaw was used," said the spokesman of the mayor of the Wozłomiński, Karol Szysko.
Inspectors from the attention of the vołomin region carried out control at a plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
Under the agreement with the capital water treatment plant "Czaka" does water waste management services under the private "Dar-Trans".
“An inspection of the installation has been carried out and an entrepreneur has been asked to provide documentation related to his activities,” Szyszko said.
He added that the audit report would be forwarded, among other things, to the Regional Environmental Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last check in "Dar-Transie" was carried out by the voivodship of the Environmental Inspectorate in Warsaw in the period 29 December 2015 – 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not take samples, measurements and testing of groundwater, nor did it have results from tests of stabilised municipal sewage sludges from the waste water treatment plant "Czaka".
Following the review of the VIOS, Dariusz Saturday was called to cease violating the conditions of the decision.
The private "DAR-TRANS" Sales and Transport Plant Dariusz Saturday is one of the waste collection companies in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludges from the "Czaka" treatment plant.
According to the decision to process waste disposal in the production site, up to 60 000 tonnes of waste per year are processed in the forests near Zielonka.
The Warsaw Municipal Water and Canal Company reported last Thursday that STUOS was shut down at the end of November and December 2018, which was related to damage to one of the combustion plants.
According to MPWIK, the monthly cost of exports is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"You have taken up a difficult task, you can count on my total support", said Lech Wałęsa to Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska on Friday.
"Mr President, these are very important words to me", said the candidate for the Civil Coalition for the Prime Minister, the leader of the list of KO in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, he is now a "retirement fan".
Margaret Kidawa-Błońska met with former President Lech Wałęsa at his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk on Friday.
The son of Wałęsa – Jarosław also took part in a brief conversation behind closed doors.
"You have taken up a difficult task," said Lech Wałęsa after the meeting.
"You can count on my total support," he added.
"The problems ahead of Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, the great hope that you as a woman can cope with these problems, and we all – those who love Poland – will support your actions to the maximum", said the former president, addressing Kidawa-Błońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked you for your support.
"Mr President, this is very important to me, because no one, as you cannot speak about freedom, about the Constitution, and knows how important it is," she said.
“ We will show you that you can do a different, wise policy, together, but according to the Constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with the respect of others.
This is what the Lord did to his revolution, and we want to change Poland," said Kidawa-Błońska.
Old-age support
He told the reporters that he is now a "retirement fan".
"I'm looking at it, of course.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, proven, (to this) we will return.
The distribution of power is the most important, the Constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And all of this needs to be cleaned, all of this needs to be restored to normal action, and I believe that this time we're going to do it.
Because if we don't, we have a street criterion," said Lech Wałęsa.
"That is why it is so important that the Poles go to the elections, think and make their own decisions.
And that's the most important thing," Kidawa-Błońska said.
"The last chance that we will improve the situation of things in Poland with a card" replied the former president.
"We must build a new foundation"
Asked her about the most important changes that should be made in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “The President has said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since there is no power, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and that everyone knows that Poland will not move forward."
ME volleyballs: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-final.
On the hot ground in Lublin, Polish volleyballs worked with the Slovenians in the semi-final of the European Championships.
There was no need for controversy or discussion with the judges, with the coach of Poles Vital Heynen as the lead.
The White-Reds have lost 1:3 and will play for the brown medal.
The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate adopted, without amendment, the Act on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important public officials and on flights of the most important persons in the State.
In favour of the amendment of the Act on the property of families of civil servants, without amendments, 52 senators voted, 14 against, three abstaining.
Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments tabled during the Wednesday debate by Senator PO Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendment was intended to "civilise" and to limit the scope of the information provided in the statement on the property situation of the own children, the children of the spouse, children adapted to cases where the children remain in the joint household with the person obliged to make a statement.
The act on the transparency of the property of the families of the most important state officials, which was created at the Prime Minister's office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.
The rules provide, inter alia, that the Prime Minister, ministers, Members, MEPs, Senators, Presidents of the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as those who head the other state institutions, will be required to provide property information about spouses, children and persons who are in common.
Nor did the Senate propose amendments to the Act on Flights of Key Persons in the State.
It regulates what flights have HEAD status and who may be on board government aircraft with the most important persons in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for keeping the Central Register of Flights.
In favour of the law – no amendments – 55 senators voted, 12 opposed, four abstaining.
According to the law, every flight of the President will be "on an official mission".
The President's flights will be able to accompany family members and others invited by the President.
On the other hand, the flight to the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will only be "take place to perform tasks directly related to the function".
The Act also specifies the list of persons who may be accompanied by the most important persons in the country during the flight.
Members of the delegation may, according to the rules on board, be invited by Members, Senators, representatives of the public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational services; and journalists.
In accordance with the Act, in the event of doubts regarding flights by Sejm and Senate Marshals, the Head of the KPRM will request clarification.
If such doubts are not explained within the time limit set, the Head of the KPRM shall be required to notify the Head of the Sejm or the Senate of the failure to organise such a flight.

After the first training in Paris, Poles wait for the last rival
On Friday, the Polish volleyball took their first training in Paris, where they will play a game with a bronze medal on Saturday.
The caretaker Vitala Heynen's way to the title closed Thursday's failure with the Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud of them to travel to that duel.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday afternoon they went with the Slovenians with a charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had training in the famous Berca Hall.
According to the reports of those present in the class, the world champion coach was nervous.
As the assistant of Heynena Michał Mieszko Gogol noted, this time the main task was not to exercise the volleyball elements themselves.
“We went to the lobby, but in the vast majority it was time for the band.
It was about spending it more together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild all of this as a team," he said.
He confirmed that semi-final failure was a painful lesson for both players and training staff.
"We have been brutally brought to earth.
Without a doubt, we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd go back to that game.
We discussed this game with each other at the staff, the coach talked a lot to the players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would point to inefficiencies in the attack and much worse than usual to deal with the situation balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect", he analysed.
In his opinion, the White and Red Committee did not prevent stress associated with the appearance of a loud and numerous public co-operators of the tournament.
He admitted that world champions might have put the smooth way to the semi-finals a little bit.
"Maybe if we had failed in a similar style in the group phase, we would have analyzed this lesson faster and then played in the next stage of the tournament.
But it's only when he's doing it," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with the Thursday defeat of Poles will be able to turn into aggression in a bronze match.
“I hope that we will then show our true faces.
There's something to fight for.
We recently won the ME medal in 2011" he reminded.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, went to Apeldoorn for the first two meetings of the group, and the semi-finals moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment, but in suspension
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban on take-offs and a fine of $25,000 – in a half-year suspension – for the compulsive words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour is losing patience with Kyrgiosa, but they are still giving him a chance to improve.
The summaries of the most unscrupulous tennis player in recent years are looking at a serious - 16 weeks break plus a lot of fines, but both penalties are suspended for a six-month period – a trial period in which the rascal athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been breaking down for a long time and has made a specific tennis record of the world – he had to pay the highest in history discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of conduct on and beside the court.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsports behavior, insulting judge and viewers, breaking two missiles during a lost match with Karen Chaczanov – he paid $133,000 after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati.
He did not play in the US Open 2019 for long, but was able to say publicly that ATP activists "are corrupt", which hurt so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and, after a few weeks, gave this verdict about suspension of take-offs and another fine.
But he was forgiven for the words of corruption, after listening to the accused and learning the context of the statement.
In the justification of the tennis activists, however, the investigation showed that the behaviour of Kyrgyzos for the whole of the past 12 months in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted almost continuous violation of the rules that he had continuously insulted people associated with tournaments and viewers, hence a high penalty.
ATP, however, gave him five days to bring an appeal and immediately dismissed the execution of the sentence, ordering several conditions to be fulfilled within the next six months: ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios tournaments can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct of existing professional tennis players, in particular, they can no longer curse, destroy rockets, fight with judges and the public, nor do any other way to behave indecently and vulgarly.
He also received a recommendation to look for “continuous support” from mental trainers during the tournaments and also outside the season to consult with people specialising in solving the problems of athletes who do not cope with proper behaviour.
The first comment (social media) of Nick Kyrgiosa to the verdict was: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
All I have to do is control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break, since the Lavera Cup has sharpened his shoulder injury, so he had to give up the nearest start in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the ATP ranking, Kyrgeos takes 27th place.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, earning over 1.3 million dollars, so even after fines he will stay a lot.
GUS: Poland is living better and better
The report on household budgets published on Friday by the GUS shows that 44% of the GUS assessed its material situation as good or rather good.
The previous year was 37.2%, 33.5% in 2016, and since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessment of the household situation, it had never been more than 30%.
In 2009, a total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% earlier and more than 20%.
The best is the material situation of self-employed households.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or good.
At the second pole there are households rencists, where the proportion of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has an important impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is for single parents who raise offspring, of which good or rather good material situation declares 32%.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55% to 60%, and among childless households it is 48.8%.
These statistics clearly show the impact of the 500+ programme.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst material situation was assessed by parents who raised their offspring and families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessments of the situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid increase in income, mainly from work.
But that is not all, because the share of households who consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear link between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households at the voivodship level.
The best ratings are formulated by the inhabitants of Opole Voivodship, where they consider 48.9% of the surveyed to be good or rather good.
There are also Lubuskie voivodships (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and West Pomeranian voivodships (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opole, government income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average and 98% in Lubusek.
The highest revenues were for Mazowiecki people (120% of the national average) and for Silesian people (104%).
On average in Poland, the disparate income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjustment for the impact of price changes) increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
It's pretty low against the background of the previous years.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.
While the increase in income slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These in person amounted to PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9% in real terms and by 4.3% in 2016.
The household budget surveys suggest that the statistical household is currently spending 70.1% of its government revenue, while in 2014 this share was still above 80% and by 2006 it was above 90%.

USA: Three suicides among the aircraft crew
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush last week – reported the U.S. Navy.
In the last two years, five crew members have been killed in total.
Previous suicide took place in July of this year and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Every incident occurred on land, when the USS George H. W. Bush cumulated off Virginia Coast.
So far, third party participation has been excluded.
Besides, death isn't supposed to be related.
"The need for everyone to be involved in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to point out that there is no stigmatization or other conversations related to the search for help," Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander, wrote on Facebook.
The pope is critical of Síłołowski.
John Paul II did nothing
In his discussion with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiółowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.
"Almostly every opinion of him was accepted."
Later, some of his actions were criticised.
“For me, John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzek, it is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptor – the pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media into the best in his life of Pope Polak", he explained.
The former PO politician admitted: “There was a cloud of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, once Rygzyka did not accept, but he had power and could just throw him out of the Church for politics or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do it, similarly his successors", explained Niesiłołowski.
"This was followed by the fatal issue of pedophilia and the Church's activities and, in fact, their lack of them.
I ran out thinking a little further, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.
We know about the pedophilia scale in the Church from a relatively recent point of view.
The question is how can it be that John Paul II, when he was the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," he says in a conversation with the journalist Nezielowski.
In the evaluation of the former Polish politics, the Church is an ally of the PiS.
“We must admit that during the Solidarity period, the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, cross hanged everywhere.
Now these crosses are spelling, they have become a symbol of the dictatorship – a sign of the scripture.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk will shake the Polish Church that John Paul II did nothing on this matter and that today the Church is an ally of the PiS.
It is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will come to pay for the elephant", convinced Niesiłowowski.
“I hope Pope Francis will chase Jędrzeszewski, Rydzek and some others of this type,” he concluded.
HRUBIES: Tomorrow, the 590th anniversary of the county

The PZPN is punishing the stadiums with fines.
Gryf disqualified
As part of the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk’s small hair, it did not end tragically when the goalkeeper Zlatana Alomerovicia passed by millimetres by fans from Wejherov.
After this incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The investigating case of the PZPN was severely punished by Gryf, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, the fans will not be allowed to play their own stadium in the nearest match.
They won't be able to go to league games until December 31st.
Burdy also called fans of Silesian Wrocław at the Widzewa Łódź Stadium.
However, here the PZPN judgment was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events might occur and felt the appropriate authorities on this issue.
Nevertheless, the services allowed the rejection of the Łódź sector with racers, the burning of chairs and the money of the host sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN ukarał Śląsk with one-off stadium ban in the nearest match in the Polish Cup and prohibited the organisation of trips to matches in this and another edition of PP.
The trip ban also included league matches of Extraklas, but there it will last until December 31st.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to exchange markings on the entire road network managed by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Reich
In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the amendment of the Regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among other things, the registration of the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish.
For example, "Lions" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our voivodship, changes will be made on 94 road signs on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines stem from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should keep in mind that the names of the village in the neighbouring countries often also have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the change we have made in the law, they will finally appear on the roadside directions on our roads.
The introduction of new markings starts with the section of the A4 motorway in Podkarpackie", said the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
The changes will be made to Podkarpacie on 94 road signs on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200,000 PLN.
In the first instance, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned until 1 November 2019.
What does the idea look like?
It'll take place without replacing the plates, on a sticker basis.
They will replace the existing names of the village with the new ones written in Polish on existing characters.
Both names will be recorded in one row – first in Polish and then in original, in brackets.
This will be a great facilitater for people who do not know the spelling of foreign city names in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan out of a windmill
In the pond in Zameń, in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants noticed a swan having problems with the wings.
After fishing and visiting the vet, it turned out that someone had made an animal target – a blow from the windmill was found in his body.
"The early bird received information from residents of the village of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Centre in New Sola.
According to the report, the animal had broken its wings.
We went to the scene.
You could see right away that there was something very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and accurately to avoid harming him and not put additional stress on him.
The swans were caught and taken to the vet.
After the first photo of the X-ray, it was already known that someone made it into a shooting shield.
In his body were the fragments of the bullet", says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, managing, among others, the center of rehabilitation.
I'm wintering in the resort.
"The wounds were cleaned, the birds were given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the resort where they would spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly yet.
Letting him go now would be because he probably wouldn't survive the winter," Walasek adds.
After the swan's rehabilitation, he's going to let him go to the same pond in the spring.
After receiving information about the animal’s poor health status, the municipality of Zjukowice intends to inform the prosecution of the case.

Gowin: "We must stimulate Polish small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the State has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement.
Gowin, during the interview on the Radio Signals of the Day, stated that the trade is controlled by international networks that impose so low margins on Polish producers that, in fact, Polish companies cannot develop.
Note that the problem is very difficult to deal with, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the government of PiS tried to face this at the very beginning of the term of office, but received a "contra of the EC".
"We have won the Court of Justice, and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and formulates the government, we will go back to this topic," he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, i.e. small trade".
"There will be a need to consider whether the government has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said Gowin.
In May, the EU Court found that the European Commission made a mistake considering that the Polish retail tax was illegal public aid.
The Retail Tax Act assumed two rates of trade tax: 0.8% from income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% from income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated infringement proceedings by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered as public aid.
It then stated that the tax was implemented in an illegal manner.
It also issued a suspension order until its analysis by officials in Brussels has been completed.
Poland did not agree with this position, but tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU Court has opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but has not ended the case.
On 24 July, the Commission brought an action before the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSEU submitted to PAP that the case is currently in writing, in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether or when the oral procedure, namely listening to the parties and a possible hearing, will take place.
The need for a good few to several months after the appeal was brought before the judgment.
"This procedure lasts on average a year", said PAP a source in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How to Dress a Child for Baptism?
We are making a few practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.
Often, it is the first time that the whole family is around the child, celebrating its appearance in the world.
No wonder freshly baked mother and dad want their comfort to look the best on that day.
But before you and I make a final decision on the baby’s outfit, ask yourself whether it will be comfortable as well.
In shops you can find many dress kits that do not provide the little one with proper comfort.
What, then, should be noted?
The basic criterion of choosing a baptism dress is the age of a child
Until recently, several weeks old children were baptized, dressed in white sets and put into the same barrels or big pillows.
Today, children joining the sacrament are often older: several months, a year or more.
It's hard to imagine that such a great comfort needs a different dress for baptism.
So if your child is three to four months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or on the hands of his parents or the godfathers.
The best way to do this is to dress it in comfortable, cotton sleepers or completes.
Although this part of the wardrobe is considered to be a daily outfit, it is sufficient to look for its sacred variants, for example with a wave or lace.
It's perfect for the boy to have points with the printing of flies and shells.
For older children, you can afford more fantasy in your clothes.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tilled dress
Many of the parents of the girls with longingness look towards the richly decorated, falbating dresses for baptism in a set with coats, bracelets and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers are using artificial, non-breathing materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right dress you will be better placed in the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant suits on cotton linings.
The delicate, tibia skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and lovely outfits will make your little girl look beautiful and comfortable.
Perfect dress for a little gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, boys had fashion for suits, which are a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, rigid collars or helmets often made young elegances demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they were thrown out by comfortable cotton sets.
Just take a look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, that is, a soft, tight shorts, and in addition, a blouse decorated in front with a vest pattern.
These machines look extremely sacred, but at the same time they do not hesitate to know the world of the little one.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a property statement
Krystyna Pawłowicz submitted a property statement at the end of her term.
It shows that the PiS has collected 110 thousand PLN of savings.
Let us remind him that Pawlowicz had announced leaving politics.
With the end of his term of office, he has an amount of 110 000 PLN.
According to the statement made by the Member, it takes a monthly pension of PLN 4.7 thousand.
Pawłowicz has an apartment worth PLN 570 000 and a slightly smaller apartment that he rents, by collecting PLN 880 a month.

The property declaration was previously published by Jarosław Kaczyński.
Voting on the session break at the Conservative Party conference
British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the House of Municipalities for the annual Conservative Party programme conference, as requested by the government.
289 Members were in favour, against – 306.
As a rule, the House of Communes does not hold part-time conferences so that Members do not have to give up or attend Parliament meetings.
However, opposition parties considered that, at such a crucial time as the last weeks before the UK's planned exit from the European Union on 31 October, the Parliament should not interrupt the proceedings.
The government's request for a break was made by 289 Members, against which it was 306.
Two opposition parties after the Conventions
Failure to agree on a break may be accepted as political revenge against the opposition at Prime Minister Boris Johnson as his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was found by the Supreme Court to be illegal and uninhabited) and for not wanting to apologize for it after the decision of the judges.
Following that decision, the Chamber of the Communities resumed the session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was the speech of Johnson and the following stormy debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking brexite and avoiding early elections.
"It's time for the brilliance to be realized.
It must be realized to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Rexit needs to come so that we can take care of the agreement on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
Rexit must be realized so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to start in Manchester next Sunday and last until Wednesday, October 2.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the reasons Johnson was explaining this lengthy suspension of Parliament was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda considers anti-Semitic attacks in Poland to be a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” writes foreign media.
The President's spokesperson has definitely deplored these reports.
"That's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
Israel's media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", refer to "Jewish Insider", say that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Polish consulate in New York City, declared that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to Israel’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Katz, who stated in February that “Police sent out anti-Semitism with mother’s milk”.
Andrzej Duda said that he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned an act of aggression to the Polish ambassador in Israel, Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who screamed, "Polak, Pole."
"The quote is not only incomplete.
It's just not true," he said on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
According to Spychalski's website, "this is what he's come up with."
According to the "JI" speakers, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, the Commander's Cross of Order of the Order of the Republic of Poland, Edward Mosberg, and the rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was supposed to agree with President Duda's words and say that the Jews from Israel "such as Israel Kac" were responsible for the increase in anti-Semitism.
According to the sources of the Boteach portal, Mosberg's words were to be interrupted.
Who is Banas and what did he do?
Rented by the tenement basements, the journalist led to the discovery of negligence in Marian Banasia's property statements.
We're summarizing the next affair that has shaken up the ruling camp.
TVN's "Supervizjera" journalists have revealed that Marian Banasz, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has in recent years not included a property statement of a 400-metre building which is located on the Kraków Podgóry.
Furthermore, his tenant was supposed to be driving the sexbiznes in this building (and thus renting rooms for hours).
On the other hand, the building itself has been allegedly a guarantee of repayment since 2016.
Bertold Kittel drew attention to the irregularities in the "Supervizier" program.
The journalist revealed that from Banasia the town house was rented by people linked to the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
Clients were supposed to be men using prostitutes.
The charges of Banas were not clear and confusing.
Interestingly, hireed by basement workers, a journalist led to the discovery of negligence in Banasia's property statements.
The house itself was in them, for it was not clear, and the income of her rent was to be brought low.
"The property of Marian Banasia and his wife can be worth PLN 6 to 8 million.
In total, the spouses can boast two homes, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, Banasia's own house was worth about PLN 3 million already.
The Central Anti-corruption Office is currently in control of Marian Banasia's property claims for the years 2015-2019.
Banas announced that until its completion he would suspend his business in NIK. “I will go to your marshal for free leave,” he said.
The opposition demands clarification.
“We can’t hear the CBA extending its investigation or speeding up the study of Marian Banasia’s property statements.
That is why we are forced to vouch for state authorities and to submit a notification of the possibility of committing a crime [...]", said PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.
“If the normal Pole were so low, he would already have 10 checks, a tax base and a group-of-tax procedure,” he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Banasz is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
This position was set up on 30 August 2019 for a six-year term of office.
His nomination was tabled by the Law and Justice and the voices of the parties’ politicians.
Before that Banas had been associated with NIK between 1992 and 2005, he worked as a co-worker of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first reigns of PiS (2005-2008) Banas held the position of President of the Customs Service and, moreover, Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Finance.
As of 2015, he again sat on the seat of the head of the Customs Service and, since 2017, managed the National Treasury Administration.
Banas served as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki for three months.
Cooler Master launches a graphic card handle
The graphic cards are now able to weigh really much, and this naturally makes room for a category of products that it would be vain to look for on the shopping shelf just a decade ago.
This is the solution – the ELV8 RGB graphic card holder – presented by Cooler Master.
The new graphic card handle model is not only a functional solution that allows you to maintain your graphics card more confidently without relying solely on PCI-express slot strength.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoreing police orders will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding the order for certain conduct issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence, threatened by a fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.
The police union wants to make a change like this.
The idea was taken to the Chamber Committee on Petitions.
"The case is serious, because now more than half a million criminal cases have been brought to Polish courts every year," we read.
"Rzeczpospolita" has determined that the petition that the Independent Trade Union of Police is writing to Members on the amendment of the code of offences has a chance to succeed.
The petitioners shall propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Crime.
It should read: "Whoever is not subject to a public officer's request or command, issued within the limits and under the laws, is subject to arrest, fine or restriction of freedom".
“Par. 3 of this provision speaks of an identical penalty for those who, when they do not perform instructions, prevent or hinder the execution of the business activity,” states the journal.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolita", that although he agrees with the main message of the provision, he fears that if implemented, he can be used in political manifestations.
“In situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be adverse and rather than mitigate the situation, it would even make it worse,” he adds.
The statistics reported by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens have been positive in assessing police interventions in 2018 and that every month services are taking 1.5 million interventions per city.
Buras is worried about Europe
The Jakym Topol's writing is in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today mentioned in one row with Václav Havel.
So, from the beginning, Jachym had the curse of talent, which he tried to exploit.
After eight years, he returned from "The Sensitive Man."
The heroes are Buras and Soňa along with two sons, who do not, however, form a typical Czech family.
They're wandering actors, travelling across Europe.
He's a Shakespeare lover and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound of himself, and for the other time he stopped in the day of the infancy.
But it's not the heroes that are most important in this story.
They are all just the background to watch a world where there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It's a world of impaled provinces, old people's societies, suspicious people, and a dissolved youth.
"The Sensitive Man" by places turns into an absurd theatrer.
Narration imitates the didascales, and conversations of heroes create this world.
Europe is full of fear for its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.
However, the company has problems.
As reported by VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that they would cancel 105 flights in October due to the bankruptcy problems of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All trips with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The Gandava Court also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian daughter companies: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
At present, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased at Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, spokesperson Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is now "fully operational" despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British company's mother, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then calmed down that the customers who bought trips in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – announced bankruptcy at night from Sunday to Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was the collapse on Sunday of the last chance with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors claimed that, in addition to the rescue plan agreed in August at £900 million, the company would raise an additional 200 million as a winter security when travel agencies usually have a lower turnover.
However, the company’s problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of 1.6 billion pounds.

"I do not think Slovenia has played fantastically.
We're the ones who played very poorly.
This tournament is not over for us", said the captain of the Polish volleyball team Michał Kubiak after defeat with Slovenia 1:3 in the semi-final of the European Championship.
Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer prepared for visitors German Görlitz.
The aim of the action is to help combat the progressive decline in the population of the city.
Görlitz is the easternmost town in Germany.
The beautiful pastel old lady attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, according to The Guardian, the city is facing considerable problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a permanent population decline.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them moved to the west of the country, with a 25% fall in the city's population.
In 2013, it reached 54,000 people.
To fight depopulation, officials came up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
As far as the programme is concerned, 150 applications have been made.
Two thirds of them were the inhabitants of the big cities.
The programme also interested people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
“When we applied, we thought the program was supposed to convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel that it does not matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not", he added.
The city has 7 000 available apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average of the country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will be carried out permanently, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the views of the participants.
The information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need and if they decide to move – about their motivation", said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them accommodation incentives.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young specialists for life and work in the city for a year.
Today such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek islands Antikythera to Candela in Italy or in the U.S. Tulsa in the state of Oklahoma.
