Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together they have 29 percent
The eligible weakening of both sides of the previous large coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have, according to the first preliminary results of the Sunday early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered particularly strong losses, where the position of President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaking.
On the contrary, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Mr Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8 per cent of the votes remains, but it loses 5.5 per cent of the votes against the last 2006 elections.
ÖVP was even worse, which loses almost 9 percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both these great parties in the postwar history of Austria, and especially in the case of the people who called for early elections, literally a catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP came out of the coalition, the people had considerable lead in their preferences before SPÖ.
The voters, however, clearly punished them for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the President of the Party and the current vice- chancellor Wilhelm Molterer was heard.
The observers consider that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Bureau of the Party.
Such a development would perhaps facilitate the path towards an increasingly likely exit from the electoral outcome, i.e. the resumption of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-circuit populist parties - free parties (FPÖ) received a preliminary 18 percent and BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - but the social democrats at the same time expressed concern about the repetition of 1999, when the people reached agreement with the populists (when FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 she left BZÖ) on the common government, which even triggered sanctions by the European Union.
Haider has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes his return to Vienna's national policy.
The Green Party, which has been slightly lost and has fallen between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the four-percent threshold and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: India relations can cool down
According to the Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg, if the problem with Czech scientists who were accused in India of the illegal collection of bugs could not be solved, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-India relations.
The minister said it in New York after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranáb Mukherji today.
"If this hadn't been solved, then yes, there would have been some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherji said, after the hearing, that executive power may be difficult to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he stated that, in the case of Peter Švácha, who was exonerated and punished by fine, the central government may deal with the local government in Dardžiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls into.
"His problem could be solved," the Minister said.
For Emil Kučer sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said it would be best to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the sentence to be released, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also expressed himself during the negotiations.
"Recommends appeal to the higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way a Czech party can enter the whole matter is to provide the condemned "competent legal support", said the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such assistance was already provided by the Indian Party.
"We are most interested in keeping with India the best relationships that have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognise that," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the CTK said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the issue of Czech entomologists.
"We consider indeed a deep error of incarceration and prosecution of these Czech scientists," he said.
The answer to the question of whether or not he was given a promise from the Indian side to deal with matters has been avoided by the Minister.
"I've been given quite a lot of promises," he said.
The Czechs judge the fight for a seabed
He will proceed to a walled electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea area.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuoso, who belongs to a 30-member team of UN Division personnel on issues of oceans and sea law.
His boss, director of division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, the interpretation monitors and occasionally complements.
There is a work emancipation and enthusiasm.
The seabed still has a little known world, rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, ore and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing cancer medicine.
Day greater than land
Today, the coastal states began to apply for a new undersea territory vehemently.
According to the United Nations Convention, they enjoy their rights as agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shell, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, it has exclusive rights to all sources of continental shell.
"It simply follows, behind the continental beast, that part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea.
It reaches beyond the coastline of the coastal sea, often beyond the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shell shall be supported by comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three of the last countries have succeeded," said Mikulka.
The world’s message recently recorded Australia’s success, which was the first to significantly expand its undersea holding.
But he also gained New Zealand - the area of the seabed that the commission admitted to him last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the state itself.
The two countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profit that will flow from the exploitation of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, be priceless.
It shall submit its applications gradually to the other States.
They can do so until ten years after they ratified the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental beast ends, the oceanic bottom area begins with a convention declared "the common heritage of mankind".
There is no longer an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area shall be conferred by the Convention established by an international institution.
"There is no Klondajk seabed," says Director Mikulka in excess, saying that his "unit areas are clearly defined and their arrangements are contractually anchored".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
They share them with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, according to the Convention, as well as investors of a few other countries, the status of the so-called "principle investor".
He has the right to benefit from ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Mexico, Hawaiian islands and Kiribati.
The investor of the examined area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is divided there, it's a sort of underwater replica of the Tater.
"It can be used on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian worker of the Rober Sandev division brings one such concretion to an example.
It's like a little potato or, in a little fantasy, a fairy-tale shém who, according to legend, resurrected the Golem.
Germany’s special deployment units were in the process of freeing hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in dealing with the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation erupted, special units were ready, however, no deployment was made.
The public is gradually getting more details of the circumstances of the 11th liberation in Egypt of the kidnapped European tourists.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and Interior, German Special Forces were also indirectly involved.
According to the Ministry's comments, both the Federal Army experts and the anti-terrorism group of the German police GSG9, the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Authority, and the logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technoisches Hilfswerk).
However, according to a further communication from both ministers from Monday afternoon, German forces were not needed because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized the signs of forced liberation.
According to the Egyptian government, the aid offered by Germany was accepted as a support force for the on-the-spot action.
"Happyly, it didn't happen," said one of the spokesmen of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman, and also eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19th in the south of Egypt.
After kidnapping in the desert area in the south of Egypt, hostages moved in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the exemption or possible payment of the ransom.
They are now saved in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of the hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, no information is yet available when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to Bild's letter, all five tourists should also fly one of the Airbuses of the German Air Force and arrive to Germany on Tuesday.
The American House of Representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has mostly dropped a $700 billion financial market rescue package.
Index Dow Jones has dropped strongly.
In proportion 206 to 227 votes, the US Chamber of Representatives rejected the government rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both sides, the program was not found for a programme that should mitigate chaos in the financial markets.
Dramatic events were desperately trying to convince the critics of a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called before the Member to give his consent, although, as he has said, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he said.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concerns that the state rescue package could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index value rose, so that after the announcement of the crash, the package fell to the ground again.
Experts now count on other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to approve the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Travel agents record an increasing number of reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, during the next month's tour reservation, the turnover increased significantly compared to the previous year - to the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic growth, the taste of the Germans remains unsightly travel.
For the winter season, travel agents recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Union (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Survey Institute survey, increased reservations are available for autumn months as well.
The turnover was thus around 11 percent higher in October than in 2007.
GfK numbers are the basis for these results, which evaluates data on bookings from 1200 German travel agencies each month and interpolates them into the overall market.
This result included the booking of tours that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, the required trip to the US is mainly requested, said the DRV.
On these trips, the increase in the reservation makes about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece are particularly desirable targets for the Germans as well as for domestic waters.
First of all, organized tours are on course, said the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
With regard to rising energy and food expenditure, the cost here is "for customers it is easier to count than for individual organised holidays".
Laepple explained that money can save consumers, inter alia, by using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so compared to the previous year there will again be a higher turnover - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took some trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Infinitely repeated pop pops, beer from tramps and prominents in costumes from famous designers.
For the first time in the beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blond, TV moderator, and she wears a custom-made cut.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is from a secondhand.
But one thing joins us: we are not even three minutes away from beer meadows, and already photographers and obliviously fill our memory cards - it flatters me for the first time in Oktoberfest.
That's how you can be friends.
It seems my cheap cut has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my feeling of comfort was rather limited in shape.
But right after the arrival on Theresienwies, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone's wearing women's cut or leather pants; nobody looks disgustingly or embarrassingly concerned - everything is completely normal.
I'm the only one who picks up my apron at the banana stand in chocolate.
A monk warns me that I mistook her: "You're free on the left, in the middle of a virgin, on the right, in the back, widowed."
Secretly, I'm going to turn the bow from the back to the left.
"All right," he says and laughs.
The others with subtle flirting techniques don't care so much and they have simple plaited hats with the inscription "To wire to get dressed!" and they stick on passing naked asses.
A young man with such flashing inclinations is named Bob, is from England and the Oktoberfest arrived for the first time too.
He looks like a "gorgious" with an extended "oh".
That's what he's telling me after you've relieved yourself of drinking a moustache.
Right next to one of those hydrants everyone thinks they're trash cans.
Bob is therefore one of the feared Wildbieslers, as it is known in Bavaria to the public in the wild urinates.
The other lucky ones don't get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8:00 p.m. they run on an area where Oktoberfest is held, unfamiliarly paramedics who have to take care of poor drunkards.
Medical officers always appear in flocks - in four they carry covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most beer meadow visitors: empty there, full back.
Who lies under the sail of this coffin of pardon is not visible.
"It's the one that can't go any further," he'll call me in response to my question by one of the paramedics and disappear in the crowd.
The police released the name of the victim of the accident.
It was published the name of a 33-year-old woman who died in the hospital after her car hit her in Essex.
An accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, an 11-year-old man was arrested to suspect a reckless ride.
He's already released on police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began to seek entry into the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate the Turkish border.
On the east bank of Bospor, perhaps only 20 steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpaša Railway Station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Cona in a neorenaissance style.
That's what a tourist guide will tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platforms with the tower on every corner of the front, looking at the lack of recognition from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole structure is slowly falling apart.
But once you get inside the vaulted cash register, there can no longer be any doubt about the size of the company whose western gate the station was.
In August 1908, the German consortium Anatoly-Bagdad was opened by the German corporation.
Germany, which had been involved in the game of empires late, intended its ambition to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further to the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their colleges were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by the frozen limits of the Cold War, is gone
The British and colonial forces proceeded from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And bad news also came for the station Hydarpasha.
In 1917, he destroyed the ammunition train's elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually rosy and history has been around it.
However, today this gate to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - ACP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by the frozen limits of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now being applied - Turkey is getting involved.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was to meet with one of the leading ACP experts on foreign policy, the Turkish member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a codecious ride on the tracks, which reminded the rhythms of the famous Night Post document, I arrived at the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state, which wants to turn my back on its Otomanian past.
However, ACP, with its well-known Islamist roots, is a shift in Turkish consensus.
She raised suspicions in the west, especially in Washington.
Taxi led me to the state of the ACP, ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-designed stores of power, where middle managers in business suits – men and women – meet to make early morning shops.
Suat Kiniclioglu could be a middle-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Saka, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry, too.
"The aim of the Party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
Cold war was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its mansion.
Today he must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It must have done both.
"But I'm sure there will be a moment," I asked, "when might Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "you didn't want that decision to happen."
They then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost in memory: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea surroundings are as much to the benefit of Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, follow these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to Hydarpasha Station, after another major late night, I thought of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Cona, who watched this building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now be, for a certain part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was at the port waiting for a ferry back through Bospor, I remembered that those days, Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least at that time there was not much doubt that the continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Commemorative Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes in : As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, September 11) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district music plan, he founded a fine congregation of young Proteus.
He was to be up to 21 years old, but at the time when Proteus was last singing in 1979, there were a few of us almost 30 - we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape converter) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to go to any music that was submitted to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often stunning, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of the only man and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely unchanged throughout the entire time.
How often just Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it! "
His tactile technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor Mayan.
Wherever the musical standard was, he always picked it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If there was to be a conductor fit on a knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he was conducted by Guildford Philharaminical from 1962 until 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed in any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to his words, simply "taught the world with one or two soaked ovens".
We'll miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (September 25th) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying at BSc, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's notes by the author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he finished dissertation of the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 years in America as a researcher at the Houblon-Norman and summer 1952 at the Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend the José Vicente Resina exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was moved by the simplicity and powerful charge with which the audience works, and by consideration and by respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda's going to attack her bestseller again.
In November, Honda will start selling the second generation of Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle already had considerable space, he now offers even more spacious interiors.
This includes improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, many changes have occurred in this one-space car.
For example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines should be mentioned.
Even before we examine the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is that Honda needed a shorter period of time to rejuvenate this model than other producers.
Although Jazz is a less known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is a case for Japan, a country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002, and also during this year's 2008.
In Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold since Honda Jazz was released.
The second market has become an old continent with approximately half a million pieces sold in six years.
But Honda aims to increase sales in its category.
Thus, while this Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Honda Jazz in 2007, in 2009 the estimates are 100 000 cars, which would amount to an increase of 17% in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of Jazz since 2002, which is 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects the sale of 2,000 pieces throughout the year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decrease in sales in Spain.
In fact, driving is expected to end the year with a total of 22,000 sold pieces, which is 4 000 less than in 2007 and a 16% decline.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share in the Spanish market to 1.8 %, compared to 1.6 % last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid compact with a length of 4.37 meters from which Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 pieces annually.
As far as markets are concerned, according to the Japanese producer's estimates, 50 % of Insight is sold in the United States while the remaining percentage is divided by the old continent and Japan.
The opening of the sale of Honda Insight is expected in the first months of next year as soon as it is presented to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions have increased in the new Jazz.
Its length increased up to 3.9 metres (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and axle wheelbase to 2.5 meters, which means extension of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height has not changed and is still 1,52 metres.
The magnification of the dimensions also increased the internal space.
This advantage was achieved by using a new platform, as well as by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also the volume of luggage space - which has a double bottom system - has increased to up to 399 liters, by 19 liters more than the volume of luggage for the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are present with a 1.4 engine version, as the volume of luggage space at Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement in addition to the external elements - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipment with a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows an angle to open 80 degrees compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
The second generation of Honda Jazz has new engines.
From the start, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4 liters petrol engines.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that enables lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions, and deliver excellent improvements to the propulsion system at the same time with high torque to the full speed of the engine.
The first motor of 1.2 litres has a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 speeds with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 revolutions.
This engine - which had a Jazz 78 horsepower for the previous generation - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and an emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Auto bee" prevents precipitation
Progress in the development of accident protection technologies was inspired by Nissan in nature this time, specifically by bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the role of flying bees and thus prevents collisions.
Such is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in the prevention technologies of precipitation.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Centre for Technical Progress developed a robot in cooperation with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technology Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, Director General of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Brand Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of four areas of the Nissan security shield.
Robot has the task of strengthening the ability to prevent precipitation in vehicles of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
However, the most important are the composite bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, allowing bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, engineers suggested what they called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles that are up to a distance of two meters in a radius of 180 degrees before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends the signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a warning against collisions.
"The moment an obstacle is recorded, the robot imitates the bee movement and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference compared to any existing system is the fact that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobile Laboratory and Chief Engineer of this project.
The robot, unlike the bee, cannot move upward and downwards or diagonally, is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction that it is allowed to rotate its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as against the bee.
Nissan therefore used the rotation function in addition to the acceleration and slowdown to prevent precipitation.
"The establishment only needs to process the information every few seconds, and according to these data, it needs to be preserved.
It does not require storage of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, which can work without interruption with just two dozen kB memory.
It may surprise you, but we're not talking about a gig or a mega."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for immediate precipitation prevention, technology where Nissan predicts its use in serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the goal and avoid obstacles on the way.
Enjoy your fear of taking your mortgage
It should be recognised that the U.S. Finance Department, except that it has enough capital to give the injection, has neither ingenuity nor ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages at the bank with doubtful solvency, they created on the Internet a popular-scientific game "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or "Hotel of Bad Loans"... or "Hotel of Bad Loans"... or "Hotel of Bad Loans."
The hotel and especially its receptionists look cloudy to once, twice and three times consider whether it is the right time to apply for credit.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not too detailed.
It is a site more suitable for young people than for the entire public.
And what happens when the game is over?
Dream room appears inside the hotel.
At least something, because it's better not to talk about buying the house...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital MUFG
Morgan Stanley's banking house announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) was the biggest Japanese bank that would spend nine billion dollars to get 21% of its capital.
A week after they discovered their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a single price of $255, representing a total amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of securities as at 31 August.
The MUFG bank invests another six billion dollars in obtaining convertable securities that will provide it with a 10% return and whose exchange rate is 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley specified that the whole operation would take place on the basis of an average single price of $29, i.e. 28% under his current course.
Morgan Stanley's shares still lost 6.79% and reached 23.07 dollars around 17.00 Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the Act of Bank Holding," explained John Mack, CEO of this American group.
The new Statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which would allow him to differentiate his activities, but it would also place him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest ace from Wall Street to take a much more careful approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday show, among other things, that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that he will sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for approximately $8.5 billion.
"Just a week ago we thought," explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, given the current situation of economics and the market, we wanted to reduce the risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less for Morgan Stanley's securities than their book value.
And the operation will result in a 20% reduction in share profit.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter will be exchanged for a certain period at a price of 50 % exceeding the exchange price, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that will bring MUFG will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and raise his cash.
However, the group spokesperson refused to provide specific information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast about 15 %, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan specified that since the end of August, he's reduced his balance.
The last weeks have been difficult for the group, since its stock exchange rate has halved, while insurance costs against the risk of default linked to debt have increased rapidly.
These costs took the opposite development on Monday, but remained high, around 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" from Wall Street's big investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's ransom, announced that she had selected $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffet.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quit.
Reestablish the republic around the 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuela Hugo Chávez, Bolivia Eva Morales and Ecuador Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third appointed person submitted a proposal for a new Constitution, following the model of his counterparts and friends.
And his mission was fulfilled, since 64% of the voters voted in the referendum 'yes', according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
"No" according to these results was 28 %, 7 % of the votes were invalid and 0,7 % of the voting tickets were empty.
In order for the Constitution's proposal to be adopted, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two surveys carried out at the east of the electoral rooms and the calculations of the NGOs predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, with them situated between 63% and 70%.
Raphael Correa, in the night of Sunday on Monday, demanded the victory of his proposal of the Constitution.
"The Constitution won the whole line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the residence of Guayaquil governorship, 280 kilometres southwest of Quit.
They understand themselves that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in peace according to the observation mission of the United States Organisation (OEA), concerned the text on 444 points building up "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The proposal of the Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over the economy by reserving it the "planning of development" of countries living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from the foreign currency that emigrants are sending.
The proposal adopted by Correou, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of State, which will be able to exercise two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to disband the House.
Correa has already announced that he will exercise this competence and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, among other things, strengthens the principle of free health and education, which the President began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, the ban on the presence of foreign troops is also based on the ban, thus ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuadorian base as the starting point of American drug operations.
19 hostages were released in Chad
The Egyptian commando took over eleven tourists and their eight-member companions who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were living and healthy in Egypt on Monday.
During the morning, the Egyptian commanding officer set them free in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, close proximity to the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transferred without having the opportunity to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, a peripheral residential district of Cairo, to be subjected there to medical examinations.
"They are perfectly healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers", said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garrana on the airport's route.
Since its arrest on September 19th during the safari in a vehicle powered by all four wheels at the foot of Mount Uanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages were dragged from one hideout to the other by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five German and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer safari.
A representative of the Egyptian security forces suggested that 30 members of special units who approached the site on board two helicopters set off on the trail just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source that wanted to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the unit "blask" were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The chief Italian diplomat Franco Frattini from Belgrade, where he is now located, mentioned the role played by secret agents and Italian Special Forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of people from our secret services, from special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that a ransom would be paid.
On the eve of the Sudanese army declared that she had arrested a vehicle with all four wheels on it, with six of them killed, including the Chad commander and two arrested.
The army claimed that they were linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, a movement for the liberation of Sudan - Unit (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the said movement.
Letters - The silent majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of the newspaper's headlines and is the topic of the ongoing election campaign.
The better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to wash poor sums that are provided by small museums, archives, archaeological digs and national memorial places that starve?
Which politicians dare remind the federal government that they will forget their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Québek, like in Canada, we don't have laws that would actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros on restoring the only Chinon castle in the Loira Valley?
With our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organisations, in synergies.
In Québek, a federation of companies for the history of Québek, seeks at least 40,000 volunteers associated with 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy to spread history, preserve a pile of private archives and protect archaeological remains for a few minors.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments that are driven by hopelessness protest when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers to old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When are we finally going to get the grandstand for history and memory?
Benelux Governments National Part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries will help the Belgian-Hungarian bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the widespread impact of the US mortgage market crisis, partly by: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, with an amount of EUR 11.2 billion.
On this weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed to take part in the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to be regarded as precedents in the context of the crisis of international financial markets for more than a year.
In the sense of a decision that was born on Sunday night, all three countries will redeem nearly half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets.
The Bank will sell with absolute certainty part of its capital shares, especially then - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis Bank's shares began to drop rapidly last week, and in the second half of the week serious signs of a crisis appeared at the Institute.
However, analysts agree that with their 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it go.
The company's valuable papers fell by only 12 percent on Friday, to a minimum of 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Given the current share prices, the total market value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the business leaders, this is unrealistic.
In fact, the management of the company blames for the fall of Fortis’ shares of uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday, the stock rose slightly.
On Friday, a new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to the bank.
The Institute of Finance was looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer no one has applied yet.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry about their money, they will not lose their money.
The bank's clients have not yet been panicked, and the branches have not been taken up by attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and also bought several leasing companies.
A fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract based on drug purchase data from people.
Data protection experts are concerned that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of data on prescription drugs in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
He must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the henhouse to the fox," quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of a program designed to monitor prescription drugs.
The insurance company shall be insured and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events dependent on the health status of the persons concerned and, if the risk is assessed as too large, the insurance shall not close the insurance with it.
They had previously sent the medical examinations concerned and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the number of pharmacies' identification number, he easily finds out what the drugs he's bought in the last year and a half, which he's running himself on, what he's suffering from disease and what his health is like.
For example, if he regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to the fact that he has virtually uncontrollably high levels of blood fats, which immediately includes him in a category with a higher risk.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation, some of which simultaneously determine the risk coefficient, so that insurance companies, in addition to paperwork, almost no job remains, although small difficulties arise.
The disadvantages are that some medicines can also be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, used against migraines or hot flushes, but are also effective against depression.
These are, from the point of view of commercial insurance undertakings, a significant risk factor, whereas the first mentioned difficulties are not.
In order to request and process data, specific companies have been set up, which will request the patient's permission before they obtain the necessary information from the pharmacies.
That is what the authorities are now forcing, although they have not punished them for their negligence.
Some companies have been processing the results of laboratory tests recently, which combine data on medicines used, which can provide an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to the data, while checking their use will become more complex.
There is a special health data protection law, but its effectiveness only applies to health care providers and insurance companies.
The draft law, which will give the authorities the power to control companies specialising in the provision of data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: that is why he has developed his programme so that the data transfer is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that he can hardly deny the permission in question, otherwise the insurance company won't conclude the contract with him.
So hens are, after all, referred to the fox's goodwill.
Global Marseille menu
The European Union and India will double trade
Since the European Union and India are mutual leading trading partners, this topic has led, alongside other global problems, to also the agenda of the Ninth meeting at the highest level.
Today, the French-Indian Summit will also be held, at which it will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given greater opportunity to speak on international issues, but Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in support of the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even discussed at yesterday’s Ninth Summit, held in Marseille.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solan welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed to double the trade turnover within five years, or to increase to more than one hundred billion euros.
Since the exchange of goods has risen from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, it is not an overly ambitious objective.
From a legal point of view, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements were aligned with India's civil aviation agreement, so that both air and air transport were given the green light.
By the end of 2009, India and the Union would like to sign a free trade agreement.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is one of the EU's nine partners.
The summit also paid attention to the global issue.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and in respect of terrorism, has been condemned in all its forms by both parties and have called for the United Nations conference to be called to a rapid stage.
They also wanted to end the Dauha business round, although they both have a big share in its failure to date.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India has also agreed to this, as well as the need for a global agreement and production of greenhouse gas to reduce by 50 percent the climate conference next year by 2050.
Both parties would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and encourage the call of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is arriving today in the French capital city, where he is about to enter into a bilateral meeting with a trade concerning the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that the mandates to build Indian nuclear reactors worth EUR 20 billion will be acquired by French companies.
According to Agency reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Great participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international exchange meeting.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries who will take a 171,790 sqm fair with more than four hundred three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural ceremony in the Italian Hall: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) at 264 square meters of exhibition area.
It will be followed by a press meeting in the Room Structure Buchmesse in Hall 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives as regards the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books of foreign authors still decrease in relation to total Italian production, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Found a plane named Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossetta's plane, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying the desert in Nevada.
The ruins were discovered on one of the high seas plane at an altitude of 3 000 meters, in the area of Mammoth Lakes in Sieřr Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, scattered the doubts that were still left: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we're confident that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at one press conference.
So the sheriff specified that neither human remains were found on the plane nor in the surrounding area.
63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Agency (Ntsb) announced that a few hours after recognition of the wreckages, an investigation team that finally identified the aircraft was sent: it was Bellancu 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off of Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some of Fossett's personal items were found one pair near their residence in the Mammoth Lakes.
It's two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by Illinois's federal air administration, money in cash, and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The Billionaire has earned a place in history thanks to a long collection of primacy.
In 2002, for the sixth time, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks alone.
Three years later, he went around the world on a plane without landing.
His many records include a flight of 15.445 metres above the Andes, although with a copy.
Glk, a commercial you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last-born Glk from the "comprehensible" Jeeps of the Star House, using which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a vortex of news into this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional processing that will be unexpected and unconventional as well as communication that will accompany the placing on the market of Suv Glk and will be available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17th.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The project of maximum posters, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main business class of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of communication will begin with the performance of a car in a stereoscopic vision and with special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see a new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, if you look at the picture, you'll think the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumuna8 technology, the new Glk will be enlightened in various moments in all its small parts to re-scaling in a single image.
Mercedes is no doubt trying to bring something new into the stereotype of car communication.
Can he thus raise the interest of future customers? We will see.
Now we know who the Italian hooligans are.
From Trivenet.
Who are those 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been watching the Nazionale azzurra for years and which, to date, has never, in fact, made excessive problems.
She's never even met with the fans of the enemy.
Group orientation is right-hand.
The founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Terst e Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-colored flags that appear on cities of origin interested in: they removed them on Saturday night to avoid being recognized.
They inspire themselves with English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found true Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc gave the Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all in the name, i.e. easy to control.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasle, no one forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans, who had prior acts from the stadium, were denied a ticket and were banned from the game.
The Viminale is now waiting to read the reports that come from the Bulgarian police, then taking measures: In this case, it is possible to give Dasho for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified during the riot.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, won't be entering any more stadiums.
For luck.
However, there is now fear of emilation: that means more than a hundred and fifty more will be added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who act like this," confirmed Viminal.
So, "atticly open eyes, mainly because of a national game on Wednesday in Leč."
There's a small support core in Puglia.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio, on Tuesday, Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that just cares about the problems at the stadiums.
In Bulgaria, it's not a crime.
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very little happy way) which is the director of Viminálské Osservatoria (taken a place that was previously Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a flowermaker in Terst, where the core of Ultras Italia supporters was located, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - Osservatorial One - crimes are attributed to the country in which they have become.
So far, this group has remained within limits, and now let's take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let us also talk about the whistling at Mamel's anthem: it is not even a crime, but if you will allow it, it is an indiscretion..."
