Bosnia and Herzegovina I protest against the plans of Croatia for the landfill of radioactive waste
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in north-west Bosnia in protest against the neighbouring plans of Croatia concerning the storage of parts of waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for its natural beauty.
The demonstrators in Novi Grad, Bosnia and Herzegovina, demanded that Croatia impose plans to build a landfill in the former military barracks in Trgovska Gora and declared war against the project.
Waste from the Krško nuclear power plant would be stored in the facility.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, holding banners with "I want a healthy future" and "Stop - (the river) Una needs us," said that the radioactive waste landfill could threaten the river of the Union and the life of about 250,000 inhabitants.
We have to say no.
He told the crowd Miroslav Drljaca, Mayor of Novi Grad.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Una.
Located in Slovenia, the Krško power plant built in the 1980s is also Croatia.
The representatives of the two countries are expected to meet next week to discuss the issue of additional landfills.
The Croatian public television HRT said on Friday that Croatia had not yet decided whether to build the landfill itself or to pay for storing parts of the waste in a new building constructed by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told journalists that Croatia has also a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, the activists, officials and residents from every side of the country that exists in the ethnic division insisted that Croatia find another location in part of the country closer to the power station.
"Why is Croatia in the whole area claiming that Trgovska Gora in Bosnia is the best place?" Drljac asked.
We can't let them get humiliated!

American Congress agreed to sell 32 F-35 aircraft to Poland
The US Congress by 15 days after the Department of State's approval of a possible purchase by Poland of 32 multitasking fighters F-35 did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of the negotiations of the purchase.
The decision of the Congress, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After accepting the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I see no major obstacles", said John V. Venable, Senior Councillor for the Defence Policy of the Washington Conservative Think Tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the 1976 Act on the Control of the Export of Arms, a federal government represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned sales of weapons abroad 15 days before the signing of the contract, if the value of such a transaction, in the case of the sale of weapons to a Member State of NATO, exceeds 50 million dollars.
The value of the proposed transaction for the purchase of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at 6.5 billion lower. This amount includes the costs of technical and logistics assistance, support equipment and training of pilots.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft – if this transaction is finally completed – will be the American armed group Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the engine manufacturer for the F-35A fighters of Pratt and Whitney.
The proposals for buying American fifth generation F-35 fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities were submitted by the Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaszczak in May.
Poland's offer was discussed in June this year during the meeting of President Andrzej Duda with President Donald Trump in the White House.
If it is finalised, the Pentagon representatives will be watching over the implementation of this agreement in the framework of the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
The FMS Polska has already acquired, among others, an anti-raket system Patriot.
The price of one F-35 fighter at the time of Poland’s offer of purchase was – without weapons and technical assistance – around 89.2 million dol.
According to PAP, U.S. military experts who wanted to remain anonymous, the price given in the preliminary negotiations was "the maximum price, much higher than the price that will be negotiated".
"The prices are falling rapidly, now the price of one F-35 is below 80 million dollars, much less than the cost of Eurofighter, who has no advantages such as F-35", pointed out Venable.
PAP spokespersons hoped that the final negotiations for the purchase of U.S. combat aircraft by Poland would be concluded this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – offset – will be discussed directly with US F-35 manufacturers.
What is the Münchhausen team referred to in the "Payton Hobart" series on the Netflix platform?
The caregivers and parents with the above - mentioned disorder pretend that their healthy child is ill.
Payton Hobart's election series will be on Netflix today.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States of America, but first he has to become head of student government at his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's show, the American Horror Story and Glee, we'll see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt, and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet seen the show, it deals with the topic of the Münchhausen syndrome – mental illness occurring in carers who act as if a healthy person who is engaged in physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this disease, e.g. the Münchhausen syndrome, which consists in causing symptoms of a disease.
Münchhausen's replacement team is a simulation that the person under our care has some problems.
It is also called a invented and caused disease, and is treated as a violence against the child.
This is a rare condition, which usually includes a parent who exaggerates symptoms or causes symptoms, so that its child appears to be ill.
What are the symptoms of Münchhausen's replacement syndrome?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS notes the following examples of behaviour:
Convincing medical staff that a child who looks healthy, however, feels bad.
Exaggeration or development of symptoms.
falsifying the results to make the child feel sick, e.g. giving glucose to urine samples, to make it look like your child has diabetes.
To cause symptoms of disease, e.g. by giving children unnecessary medicines and other substances.
How often does Münchhausen's replacement team occur?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder is, as many cases of disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 shows that over more than two years, 89 cases of this disorder occurred in 100,000 people.
What should be done if the child is suspected of being in danger?
You should contact the local emergency department or call the NSPCC Child Protection Guide by selecting number 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid at a school in Cadana, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna – State Police Station in Cadana raided Ahmad Bn Hambal, located at Layin Maidubun Tsumma, Riga, Igabi, and arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police said that the children were under highly dehumanizing conditions, and the school authorities deny that claim.
He said: “They do not tell the truth because all the children were there with the permission of their parents.
My parents signed the form before taking the kids to school.
Every day, parents brought food to their children, and they knew the conditions.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of the children, as well as the removal of the entire eating of the students provided by the parents before closing the school.
It's not right, because parents can testify if their children are under bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the former Police Commissioner Abdulrahman, who once visited the school to check the level of child care, never had any objections.
â€€I have said that children study the Koran and nothing else.
However, a specialist in the Public Relations Police Department, Yakubu Sabo, concluded that they would join their parents once the government had passed on to the state of their children.
‘It has been subject to dehumanising conditions on behalf of the submission or acquisition of Korean knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their backs, which proves they were beaten.
That's why we're investigating school to meet her owner," he added.

Símoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be president
"I believe that Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have a chance to win the election with President Andrzej Duda," said Tomasz Siemoniak.
Deputy Head of the Civil Platform Tomasz Siemoniak spoke with Polsat News about an affair with the head of the NIC.
‘This case is disqualifying for Marian Banasia.
He can become a Minister of Culture from some entertainment, not the head of the NIC, or the Minister of Finance.
Not someone who's responsible for billions of dollars for taxes," he said.
"This case is a very serious crisis of the state," he added.
Siemens also spoke of the Jachira Claudius.
“The letters of the PiS include Antoni Macierewicz.
A man who wasn't just saying things, he was just doing them.
He judged the former SKWs about spying for Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why doesn't anyone ask Antony Macerewicz not to be on the letters?" he asked.
“The younger ones have a different aesthetics from us.
I think that Jachira, who's already apologized for one of her things, also feels that she's exaggerating sometimes.
Let's not make this a campaign problem", he added.

A "obscene" masked child rapist from Central Coast forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in a masked suit, a man grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind school and dragged her into a dense plant in Central Coast in May 2017.
He then tied her to a tree and raped her.
Soon after the arrest, a search warrant was carried out at his house, where the officers kept a number of items relevant to the investigation.
A man has confessed to the guilt in respect of seven attack charges and to three more concerning the imprisonment and sexual exploitation of another girl, aged 11, between August 2016 and August 2017.
A 12-year-old victim walked in the path, and when she looked back, she saw how unexpectedly he came out of the bushes armed with a large branch and knife.
When she begged "stop, stop, stop," he grabbed her neck and forced her to enter into the plant.
“ Quiet, don’t scream, ” said the man.
Don't yell, or I'll have to hurt you."
By holding the knife in her right hand, he tied her hands and legs with cable belts, and then tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
A man reached work around 9.30, not answering several texts and calls from his colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and carried traces of grass and trees, and he himself claimed to have been involved in an accident involving an attack of rage on the road during which he chased another driver in the bushes and fell off the top.
The man's trial will continue on Tuesday.
The Pope calls on the Executive Directors of Technology to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned the executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievements poses a risk of increasing social inequalities if the common good is not taken into account during the event from the point of view of ethics.
Pope Francis presented these words at the Vatican conference, attended by government messengers and representatives of Facebook and Google companies, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference “The Common Good in the Digital Age”.
This three-day event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in taking part in the debate on the prospects and risks of artificial intelligence.
The technological achievements in the field of war art and the future of work have been discussed, in which the machines will play an increasing role, as well as the study of the case of the case of the bomber in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the decisions taken by companies that own the social media media as a result of the spread of the film recording the massacre.
During his speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential for technological progress, noting that thanks to the machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution, workers were saved from dangerous and monotonous work.
However, he warned that increasing dependence on robotic devices in order to make profits is a risk of depriving people of working dignity.
"If technological progress became the cause of increasingly visible inequalities, it would not be real and real progress," he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of humanity were to become the enemy of the common good, it would lead to undesirable reversing to some kind of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.
Conference organizers expressed their hope to benefit from the expertise of the participants and to identify possible future Catholic advisors on high-tech issues.
Martin Odegaard, a real-morbid player, puts fans into euphoria with his impressive assistant.
Martin Odegaard noted an impressive assistance with Mike Oyarzabal's opening goal.
Win 2:0 with Osasuna, Real Madrid climbed to the top of the La League table and continued the pass of being undefeated on his own field this season.
However, despite one failure this season in La Liga Zinedine Zidane, it is under enormous pressure due to a stormy pre-semble and public argument with the Welsh star Gareth Bale.
The situation reached a point of boiling when Real Madrid was humiliated in the League of Masters by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid have real talents at their disposal – some of them now have plans for others not.
Vinicius Junior is an example of such a star in the future of Real Madrid and currently plays in the band.
However, he is a Norwegian young player, Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to Real Sociedad, who created a big move, including an incredible assist in the game La League.
During his meeting with Real Sociedad, Martin Odegaard performed an impressive assist in opening the goal of Mikela Oyarzabala and Real Sociedad finally won 3-0 before his own audience.
After removing the ball from the right, Martin Odegaard manipulated the player from the opposite team, putting the net on him, and then sent an amazing application to the centimeters between the two other players and his teammates only to add a leg.
The second goal of Willian Jose and the third goal in the performance of the amazing Oyarzabal, this time from the penalty throw, provided a decisive Imanola after Manu Garcia was returned from the field five minutes before the game ended.
Martin Odegaard joined Reala Madrid only as a 16-year-old in 2015, but had difficulty trying to meet the expectations of fans.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian footballer finally seems to be on the field.
Anna Hazare surprised by the appearance of Sharad Pavar's name on the fraud of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank
Anna Hazare said: "The name of Sharad Pawar was not on the list when I was given this matter"
The social worker, Anna Hazare, had no surprise about the fact that the name of Sharad Pawar – President of the Nationalist Congress Party, NCP – appeared in connection with multi-million-dollar fraud in the State Cooperative Bank of Maharashtra.
The ED Executive Director of the Agency has brought an action against Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar – former Deputy Minister of State of Maharashtra – and other persons in connection with fraud.
The Information Report of the Executive Director on the case, the equivalent of the police report of the FIR, was submitted by the Central Agency under the Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering.
The case is based on a report by the FIR of the Mumbai police, which lists the names of the former bank president, Ajit Pavara, and 70 former employees of the financial institution.
When the case came to me, Sharad Pawar's name was nowhere to be seen.
"How did his name come out, who gave it, only they know these things" - said Anna Hazare when asked about the ED case and the alleged connection of Sharad Pawar with fraud.
Anna Hazare, critically judging Sharad Pawar, expressed his hope that the truth would come to light as a result of a specific investigation into fraud conducted by ED.
"ED will find out where his name came from in the case", said Anna Hazare, a multiple participant in the demonstration against corruption.
Sharad Pawar refuses to commit a criminal act and claims that it was not related in any way to the bank, and also asks the sign that the case was filed for a few weeks before the December 21 elections of the Maharash Assembly.
The former Minister of the Union assured that he would not fall under the grandeur of Delhi, unequivocally referring to the central government led by the BJP.
The NCP assessed the matter of the Executive Director as a motivated political point of view.

Mylan agrees to pay $30 million under the settlement vs. EpiPen
Mylan agreed to pay $30 million in a settlement related to the lack of notification of investors of the investigation of the Department of Justice on a possible demand for too high amounts in the Medicaid programme for EpiPen.
The Securities and Exchange Commission concluded on Friday that Mylan NV qualified EpiPen for ‘general’ medicines in the program of reimbursement for Medicaid medicines.

Is this the punishment of God?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysms, severe illness, child's death.
These are dramas that cause a great deal of suffering and are difficult to understand.
We ask, "Why?"
Sometimes we hear that "God wanted" is what God wanted.
Is it the Creator who sends us unhappiness and sickness?
John Paul II suffered greatly at the end of his life
When Nick Vujic was born 36 years ago, his dad spooked out of the O.R.
"My son has no arms or legs!" he yelled to the doctor.
Parents didn't know that their child was suffering from an incurable illness that had deprived them of their limbs.
At first, they couldn't accept the boy.
But they prayed and after four months Nick's mom felt that God had a plan for their baby.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, Vujevic is a world - famous evangelizer and motivator, thanks to which many people are converted.
"I am proof that God is never wrong," says Nick.
“ When suffering affects us, it’s hard to understand.
We're looking for a reason.
We ask, «Why did this happen to us?».
If we believe that God has control over the whole world and directs our lives, then naturally the question arises whether He has sent down a disease upon us, a disaster..."

Mr PO Krzysztof Breiz is suing Caesar Gmyz
"I am suing Caesar Gmyz in connection with the campaign of lies in the spelling TV," said Mr PO Krzysztof Brejz on Twitter.
The reason for the lawsuit is the statement by the publicist of Caesar Gmyz in the program "Milla 20" on TVP.
One of the leading members of the SokimzBuraka is Krzysztof Breiz, who has a lot of experience in organising the hate department.
"People who know Marius Kozak-Zagozda – founder of the "hejterski" profile – Kierwiński, Budka and Gierty", said Gmyz.
SokzBuraka is a site and social profile with mymes and jokes about politics.
According to "Networks", this profile is followed by the PR-ovate Mariusz Kozak-Zazda.
“We have been able to find out that since April of this year Mariusz Kozak-Zazada has been employed at the Warsaw City Office, in the Marketing Office,” wrote the weekly.
"Confedration" in Olava
At the fair square in Oławo, he organized his meeting with an electoral committee "Confederacy".
The program was presented by Krzysztof Szokalski number 5 on the list, and Halszek Bieleck number 9.
The anonymous leader of the list Krzysztof Tuduj did not reach the election.
The candidates have raised many problems – from excessive fiscality of the state to health care problems.
The issue of the economic zone has also been addressed, which should work for all entrepreneurs rather than favour foreign capital.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police supervisory authority in connection with a close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The independent IOPC Police Office will examine the possibility of initiating an investigation against the Prime Minister whether abuses that constitute criminal offences have been committed in the course of public administration as mayor of London.
The Council of Great London (GLA) stated in its statement that its Supervisory Inspector had registered the Prime Minister's "prosecution related to the investigation" in connection with the accusations for the preferential treatment of Arcuri, which was based on a combination of their close relationship.
"The question of the case can be said about when information is available indicating the possibility of committing a crime" - he said.
That doesn't mean that somehow they've proven it.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine this case.
The issue is addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of police services in England and Wales.
She was referred to this police supervisor because Johnson held a position as an equivalent of the police commissioner and the Commissioner for Crime.
Johnson denied any misrepresentation of his close relationship with Arcuri.
Previously, he said he would follow the London City Council's order and give details of his relationship with Arcuri, but he insisted that the council would "consult on the wrong problem".
The warrant is the result of the report "The Sunday Times" that Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, received £126,000 from budget money, as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions, which was headed by Mayor Johnson at that time.
As a result, by the time the case was handled, the government freezed a grant of £ 100,000 to the Arcuri of Hacker House.
The government is waiting for some troublesome questions about the verification procedure carried out prior to the granting of the funds.
The Minister for Digitalisation Matt Warman said in the House of Municipals that the employees of his department "usually maintained due diligence" and that the company had a UK phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, calls to the number were redirected to the California office, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is currently to live.
The close relationship between the Prime Minister and the businesswoman "was the secret of the polyszynel" for the staff.
GLA’s decision to refer the Prime Minister’s case to the independent IOPC Police Office was disgruntled at 10 Downing Street.
According to a high-ranking source, the government's representative is "politically motivated", and its deadline is "publicly political" on the eve of the Conservative Party conference.
"The Supervisory Inspector did not provide any evidence of the charge, and the Prime Minister did not get a chance to respond before the press release late on Friday evening" claims the source.
Neither citizens nor the media can be put on such a public policy.
Today, in earlier hours, journalists "The Standard" were told that Johnson's close relationship with a businesswoman from California, who was assisted by the agency for tourism and promotion in London, was "the secret of polyszynel".
The above-mentioned staff of the London & Partners (L&P) reminded that Arcuri had received seats during Johnson's foreign trade trips as mayor, even though her companies were not then considered to be "believable".
Third drug crime charge in connection with the death of Mac Miller
LOS ANGELES (AP) – A third man was arrested and charged with drug offences in connection with last year's death as a result of drug overdose.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected to sell counterfeit oxycodone pills treated with fentanyl, which Miller had in his possession before his death last September due to accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a strong opioid responsible for "epidemia", which absorbed several thousand human lives in the United States.
Walter's accused of delivering pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents sealed off on Tuesday reveal that Pettit has been getting drugs from Walter all August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havas City, Arizona, is suspected of acting as Walter's "currier" who provided Pettit pills.
None of these men were directly accused of causing Miller's death, and none of them presented a line of defense in their case.
Walter, who is subject to parole in the 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been sentenced to five months for violating the conditions of the release.
The prosecutors of the case, which she first reported on Thursday on a website dedicated to TMZ celebrities, demand that Walter remain in custody pending the trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of escape of the accused.
The answer to the message left on his lawyer's answering machine didn't come right away.
Pettit was filed in federal court on 4 September, and his defense attorney refused to comment.
The words of miller's rhyming songs are a sincere conversation about his depression and the use of drugs, making him a fan of the biggest hip-hop stars.
He came from Pittsburgh Miller, who was really named Malcolm James Myers McCormick, for two years remained in connection with the singer Ariana Grande, who had already finished in 2018.
After his death on Instagram, she published a moving movie with Miller and a song called "Thank U Next", in which she mentioned him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been linked to the abuse of opioids in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the 3 Doors Down band, also died of an overdose in 2016, and the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone in his body was found.
This article introduces a change: the correct spelling of Walter's name is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates over 30 games for mobile devices
A 9-year-old creates a game of type playing hide-and-seek with a free Scratch 2 programming application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has generated more than 30 mobile games using it.
There's a bat in today's game that's hiding according to the program.
The player scores every time he catches a bat that comes out of the safe house.
I learned to create games on an accelerated course.
"Now I make them when I'm bored," said Basil CNN.
In March, my dad recorded it for a five-day accelerated course for children aged between 5 and 15.
The course, organized by Codefest International, was intended to provide children such as Basil, access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara Senior, claims Basel played a lot of mobile devices.
“When he was four, I bought him a tablet because he always caught his phone and played it.
He played a lot at Candy Crush and Temple Run," CNN's father said.
But Basel's interest in creating games grew when he was seven years old and received a stock exchange for spending all his time on games.
“One day he played the tablet as usual, and he was so excited about it,” said his father.
For anger I said, "You're just playing, can't you think about creating your own games so that others can play them?"
Speaking of which, I was upset, and I didn't think he'd take it seriously," he added.
He has since shown active interest in learning how to create his own games and has led parents to buy a laptop and save it for a course during which he has learned the basis for creating games.
In the future, Basel, who wants to be a scientist, gives his thunder title based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available in Google Play Store.
Africa has the largest youth population in the world and, like Basel, this population includes innovation leadership on the continent.
Recently two Nigerian 12-year-olds have been praised for using codes to create robots that divide their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from the women's high school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for the programming of boxing robots.
And thanks to growing investments by giants in technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basel and its peers are on their way to careers of coding stars.
The former President of the Republic Party in North Carolina will admit to a lie about corruption
It appears from the documents submitted on Friday that the former President of the Republic Party in North Carolina will admit in court that he lied to federal agents investigating corruption of the main political donor.
According to Robin Hayes, he's going to plead guilty next Wednesday.
It appears from a document based on the facts prepared in the framework of the defence agreement signed by Hayes' lawyer that Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to the FBI's corruption investigation agents in 2018.
The defense settlement has been sealed, and the actual basis does not suggest that Hayes's accusations will be acknowledged.
Initially, he was accused of collusion, corruption, and false testimony.
The prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of taking part in an insurance company's plan to direct donations to the main company in the country of the insurance market regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two associates have been charged with attempted bribery of the State Insurance Commissioner Mike Casey.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment firm, one of the main state political donors in recent years, who has spent more than $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported mainly the objectives and policies of the Republic Party, but also provided donations to the Democrats.
His lawyer didn't respond to a Friday email asking for comment.
Hayes Kearns' defenseman Davis hasn't answered a Friday's email asking for comments.
From Friday's court records, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he didn't talk to Causey about the state's employees at the Department of Insurance.
In line with the factual basis document Hayes actually talked to the Commissioner for Insurance about Lindberg's request for changes in the staff employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with Casey and that he spoke about the bribe directly with the regulator.
According to the April Act of indictment, Lindberg required special treatment of his insurance business and planned to transfer up to $2 million to the Causey campaign in 2020.
It follows from the act of the prosecution that the statement also requires a change of the department official who was in control of Lindberg.
The former Republican Casey reported an alleged attempted corruption to federal agents and helped them gather evidence on the case.
He wasn't charged with any charges.
According to Lindberg's indictment, he ordered Hayes to hand over $250,000 to the Causey campaign during a conversation where Lindberg and Casey were also present.
During the conversation, Hayes initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such a amount of money would attract attention, but, as is apparent from the accusation, he finally withdrew.
"Whatever you want to do, we'll do it," Hayes said.
"All right, I'll take care of it."
The spokesperson of the federal prosecutor did not reply to an e-mail asking for further information on the settlement.
Drivers will take the first episode of the new burial
The drivers from Saturday will be able to use the first of the three built mountain sections of the express road S7, the new Zakopianka – from the Commielna White to Rabka Source and further the two-way main road accelerated to the Chabówka.
As the spokesperson of the Kraków branch of the Directorate-General for National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA) Iwona Mikrut informed on Friday, this is the first of three sections built S7 south of Krakow, from Lubnia to Rabka Source, which will be put into use.
From the 6-mile episode from the Commie White to the Chabówka, more than one third, i.e. about.
2.3 km, led on viaducts.
Seventeen of them were built, including the longest and highest, which was a mile [ km] long and 50 m high, and four small objects on the liquids at the Commie node.
From this node there were conventions in Wadowice and Nowy Sącz, to the national road 28 and to the old DK7.
From the next node, Zabornia, you can go to DK47 in the direction of New Targ and Zakopane and to DK7 to Chyżny and the border of the country with Slovakia.
The ILO's traveling service was established on the Zboletká Góra.
The expressway ends with the node Zabornia in Rabka Zdrój, to which the two-way section DK47 was added to the Chabówka and there it was included in the already existing two-way Chabówka – Rdzawka.
S7 Skomielna Biała – Radka Zdrój and a new section of the national road no. 47 of the main accelerated road (GP) from Rabka Zdrój to Chabówka was built by the Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The investment cost was about 615 million PLN.
The quality guarantee of the works carried out will be valid for 10 years.
The 16.7 km section of the new Zakopianka, including 15.8 km with express road parameters, was divided into three implementation sections, each with a separate contractor: Lubyń – Repair, Repair – Smiielna Biała and S Komielna Biała – Rabka Zdrój.
The first to enter the tunnel is performed by the Polish – Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and the Altis-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, the Italian company Astaldi, and the third is the Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is close to PLN 2.5 billion.
The investment is co-financed by the European Union's Centres under the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is over PLN 1.3 billion.
The whole section consists of 38 engineering facilities (bridges, viaducts, estaxads) and a two-chamber tunnel with a length of 2.06 km.
According to the road manager's announcement this year, a 7.6-mile section of Lubień – Repair with temporary inclusion in the old DK7, which drivers will avoid building the tunnel.
The last section, Repair – The Commodity White with a length of approximately 3 km, the drivers will go in 2021, after the construction of a two-chamber tunnel with a length of about 2.06 km.
Our goal is your prosperity.
"We build a State of Prosperity in Poland", said the Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to call on the councilman Dariusz Matecki, who ran for Sejm from the list of Laws and Justice.
"The implementation of the Polish version of the State of Prosperity strategy is a good change programme", said the Minister.
"We want Poles to make a lot better money so that their lives are at a higher level.
It is necessary, otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford to do so.
For four years, our government has consistently implemented a program that has committed itself four years ago.
We said we'd put in a 500-plus program.
The platform, Donald Tusk and Ewa Kopcz said it's impossible that this money just doesn't exist.
We have proven that money is and was, only PO did not care about the ones to be hit."
Ziobro also reminded of the trip for children and the 13th retirement – and that there was also a 14th retirement plan.
In addition to the "smartial distribution of national income", PiS priorities are a fair state and economic development.
Money should not go through a great stream but into the pockets of the chosen, who have good relations with the establishment and power, but should evenly go to the entire society," he said.

Facebook with care about user well-being hides the favorite counter on the test
For the first time in the world, an experiment aimed at improving the well-being of users, some people using Facebook will soon not see a number of likes, reactions and video views.
Likeness will only be hidden and visible to the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
The new Facebook version launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, Director of Facebook Privacy in Australia, said that the change is the result of a study on well-being and mental health experts' opinions indicating that the numerator of preferences may encourage comparison with others.
"The coming from a number of complaint groups working with us, as well as mental health organisations, has been really positive," said Garlick.
Removing this numerator will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of their content, not on the number of likes or reactions.
Sharing with others via the platform is expected to be more enjoyable and will not be seen as a rivalry – she said.
Garlick assured that Facebook-based companies would continue to receive the same indicators and observations that had been made available to them.
She said it was too early to be able to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram, when the test was passed on to Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
Like Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication when the experiment is completed and whether the change will be introduced permanently.
"The user's preliminary comments on the new Instagram rules were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to the opinions", she said.
Speaking about the site of the world experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically familiar Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an amazing country that will provide us with reliable opinions indicating whether new experience is valuable for those using our services or not.
Częstochowa: Councillors want compensation for pilgrims
Częstochowa kuria has not yet commented on an appeal by councillors to the metropolitan abpa Wacława Depo to provide financial compensation for the management of waste management in the pilgrimage season.
The city requests 1 PLN from the pilgrim.
On Friday, he spoke about the metropolitan speech at a press conference, including the leader of Spring Robert Biedron, which was organized to lead the Jasna Góra Częstochowa Avenue, the Vice-President of the City Council and candidate for the Sejm Łukasz Kot.
The cat reported that the day before the SLD councillors voted for the abpa of Wacław Depo for the transfer of one gold to every visitor of the Częstochowa pilgrim – to support the work of urban and municipal services, etc.
We accepted the call to archbishop Depo to help the city, to help us clean up the pilgrims, to prepare the city for pilgrims.
"We ask you to send a gold medal to the city's budget from every pilgrim.
Thanks to this, the city will be able to provide them with better conditions for their stay in Czestochowa", said the vice-president of the city council.
Mr Mariusz Bakalář, who was asked to comment by the spokesperson of the Metropolitan Curia of Częstochowa, initially prepared a several-day response, then asked, as he said, to replace it with information about the content: "We do not refer to the matter until we have received the official position of the city council."
According to the project on the websites of the Częstochowa Magistrate, the call for abpa Depo refers to "transfer of financial compensation to Częstochowa for the management of municipal waste management during the pilgrimage season".
"In view of the increasing number of pilgrims arriving in Częstochowa and the increasing costs of managing municipal waste management during the pilgrimage season, given the image of the city among residents and residents, pilgrims and pilgrims, we want to offer participation in the costs of operation of the above-mentioned garbage system in general, within the canons of care for our common well-being, the small country of Częstochowa.
"In order to maintain the cleanness of the pedestrian-traveling strings that the pilgrims are moving, while using a small infrastructure, i.e. the outer baskets for waste, we are proposing symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of PLN 1 from the pilgrim," it is written.
“In addition, in connection with participation in annual costs, which the city will cover from its own resources, taking care of the cleanliness and aesthetics of urban space, and to stress that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of these amounts will be used to improve tourism infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available to the public”, the councillors declared.
They pointed out that, in addition to financial issues, their proposal is based on the numerous reservations raised by the people about the state of purity of the routes that pilgrims are moving.
"In view of the cleanliness of our city and the positive results of our cooperation, the Częstochowa City Council calls on the archbishop of Wacław Częstochław Depo to provide financial compensation for the town of Częstochowa for the management of municipal waste management during the pilgrimage season", the appeal was repeated.
According to information from the press office of Jasna Gora throughout the year, 834 thousand people participated in this sanctuary in 200 national pilgrimages.
Some 124,000 of the faithful arrived in 255 pedestrian pilgrims.
More than 8.8 thousand people came to Częstochowa in cycling pilgrimages (133 groups), and 440 people (16 groups) in cross-country pilgrimages.
Less than 20 people reached the sanctuary of the horse and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups – on rolls.
"News" TVP missed Confederacy when describing the survey
According to a study by Pollster, 45% would be elected to the PiS Sejm, 26%, 14% left, 7% PSL, and 5% Confederate.
Even on the portal "Super Express" for which the probe was conducted, the election threshold was even mentioned.
In the main edition of "News", describing the same survey, only four first parties were presented, quite aside from the Confederacy.
Edyta Lewandowska, a leading member, made it clear that only four committees had crossed the electoral threshold and would have entered the Sejm.
The TVP vision has also been shown to share the parliamentary mandates without taking into account the votes cast for the Confederation.
It would give PiS its own governments.
Krzysztof Bosak commented on the whole situation as a "public compromise on the issue of honesty towards society".
“They began with the slogans of “moral revolution”, he recalled and stated that this matter was a sign of weakness.
Robert Winnicki, on Twitter, wrote that “The news of TVP” in subsequent actions against the Confederacy embarrass Urbana and Michnik”.
He also noted the lack of right-wing journalists' reactions.
“But let us also look at those who are acquiesciously silent.
Those “righteous,” “independent,” “incorruptible.”
In a few years, they became a more primitive version of everything they said they were fighting," he added.

A brother sentenced to life sentence for the murder of honorary social media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to pictures published on social networks, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of the Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment as the loudest in this Patriarchic country of honor.
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing bold selfies – polite according to Western standards, but in strongly misogynistic Pakistan considered provocative – was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that there was no guilt for his actions and said that he "of course" murdered his sister and that her behavior was "unceptable".
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP that he found his client guilty in court in the western town of Multan and sentenced him to life in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits) will be acquitted by a higher court of instance" - he said.
Before that, Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she was hoping her son would be exonerated.
"He is innocent.
She was my daughter, and this is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder has led the world's information services and has renewed its call for action against the so-called honor killing epidemic, in which victims – usually women – are killed for breaking the Patriarchal social principles.
Women were set on fire, they were strangled, they were shot or forged for such offences as choosing their own husband or, as Baloch did, for bringing their family to shame through the manifestation of their own sexuality.
The killings are usually carried out by a close relative.
In accordance with Pakistan’s law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (return) may ask the nearest victims to forgive.
Three months after the murder of Baloch, the Parliament adopted new legislation introducing the sentence of life imprisonment for honorary murders.
But whether murder is considered an honorary crime remains the judge's responsibility, which means that murderers can theoretically rely on a different motive and be exonerated.
In the case of Baloch, her parents first pressured that their son in no way should be favored.
However, the devastated think that he too may be lost, changed his mind, and declared that they wanted his acquitted.
The international indignation caused by murder has led the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and to announce itself to the heir with its parents, thus forcing the matter to move forward.
One of Baloch's more well-known achievements is to offer a striptease before the Pakistani cricket team and the establishment of a velvet purple dress in Valentine's Day.
She was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, saw her as a breaking limit in a country where a pose as Kim Kardashian can be seen as a bold and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The roots of "honor" murders lie in tribal social standards, which continue to dominate in South Asia, and in particular normalize the behaviour of women, although men may also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced from northwest Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the UN reported that increasing violence has doubled the number of people displaced from north-western Nigeria to around 40,000 people over the last four months.
The UN Refugee Agency has stated that concerns have created a "new exceptional humanitarian situation" which requires the interagency effort to meet by the end of the year new funds of $35.5 million.
Babar Baloch, spokesperson of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group of Boko Haram, which has been leading the uprising to the north for decades, has not been responsible for the recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfar and Katsina has been seen over the past 10 months as a result of the activities of organised armed groups.
"This has a horrifying image of anarchy and uncertainty," he told journalists on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, tortures, extortions, murders, and sexual assaults from attackers who also destroy houses and steal cattle.
Military and police were sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the military is withdrawn from the fights against Boko Haram and the branching of the Islamic State in West Africa, which has separated itself from its former group in 2016.
"The refugees do not come with the names of the groups", he said.
They come for it with terrible stories.
Refugees mostly get to the neighboring Niger.
In his statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that he expects more people to run down to Niger in the coming months along with a worsening security situation, in particular in the state of Sokoto.
A new date of trial of the man accused of killing a woman and 2 children
A new date of trial was scheduled for a Guatemalan male accused of killing the state of Iowa and her two children.
According to the Act of the District Court in Polk County, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is accused of three first-degree murders under, as the authorities claim, a false name originally given by the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't plead guilty.
According to the police, he shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son at home in Des Moines on 16 July.
The court records show that the new date of the hearing, i.e. 27 January, will give representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
U.S. immigration and customs officials say Escobar-Orellana is in the United States illegally and has been deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted of entering the United States illegally.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson, in the face of a rebellion of a cabinet wanting to reduce the demands of brexite and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the country, there is growing concern that it is not enough time to get more important concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing the risk of rebellion from an office seeking to reduce demands for brilliance and to reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
There has been an impasse in the negotiations on a new customs system which would replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, since Brussels has identified the proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as "improvement".
Ministers of the Crown expect EU decision-makers to lead the head of Germany, Angela Merkel, to offer the last-minute criticised leader compromises in the form of a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
"The Sun" journalists spoke with three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the annual Tories Conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand from the Prime Minister the rejection of a "aggressive" strategy developed by his close advisor, Dominika Cummings, consisting of attempts to use bluffs against the EU and the threat of leaving the Union without a contract, and then the acceptance by the Union of a last-minute offer.
One of the ministers of the Office identified the stern verdict of the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday on the end of Parliament's suspension as "a warning signal" and added: "The only way we can leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of a contract.
We'll never beat the arithmetic in the House of Communes, which acts on our disadvantages.
The Prime Minister must now bend and accept what he is able to receive.
Aggression doesn't pay off: it's obvious that Cummings' plan burned on a matchest.
We can't fight so many fronts.
The Second Minister of the Office has committed himself to hand Johnson over to try to push the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May if everything else fails.
The Minister said: “If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister that he will again present to the House the agreement proposed by Theresa May. ”
There are numerous chances of her voting, and everyone very much wants to end this subject.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's Boris Johnson's end and we're all out.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking the negotiations seriously.
The former First Minister of Torys said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants agreements with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels working on it.
Instead, he works with bulls in Scotland, checks eggs in Wales, and fights with citizens on the main streets of cities – all in front of the world, as if there were a campaign for good."
The spokesperson of the current Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the agreement was still a long way away and added: “No one should be deluded: a very long way to make an agreement.”
However, the spokesperson also stated that the Benn Act implementing the extension of lexit by three months in the absence of an agreement "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: “There is no doubt that this bill is making negotiations difficult for us, but despite it, the Prime Minister and his colleagues are still trying to make progress through hard work.”
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will hold more talks with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss the book on how the zone works for the whole of Ireland for food and live.
A dog with no nose and legs conquers Instagram.
Perfectly Inexact
The pussy was supposed to be put to sleep.
However, this has been prevented.
The bitch was transported from Romania to the UK by the Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The photo of the dog was published on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with an animal from the first sight.
“I was initially having difficulty believing my husband to adopt because we had three dogs,” she said.
A woman decided she'd take care of a bitch until someone adopted her.
Still no one's reported in.
“The fact that no one wanted her has made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
Finally, marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly inexact.
We love her the way she is, and if anyone doesn't like how she looks, that's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
Bonnie became a social media star in time.
In Instagram, she's being watched by over 14,000 Internet users.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with the Glass accent I would never make a career on television
According to Lorraine Kelly, the TV chiefs said that because of the accent from Glasgow, "he will never make a career" as a presenter.
Recognizing her 35-year-old career in the Kelly television industry, 59, she admitted that before her first show on the screen, she felt "very upset".
"I was only 25 years old, and I was very nervous," she said.
When I was working at BBC Scotland as a research and intelligence specialist, the boss said that my accent with Glasgow would never succeed on TV.
I went to London to meet the whole TV-am team and watch the broadcast before I took over at the Glasgow office.
I'll never forget an interview with the star Bette Davis conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a Scottish television correspondent in 1984, she started her career as a reporter in the local newspaper East Kibride in Scotland.
She then started running programs like "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak" to start with her morning program "Lorraine", which was named after her.
35th anniversary of her career celebrates a special program during which she will mention her best remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret of her long TV internship is "passion and enthusiasm" and "strangeness", adding: "We must work hard.
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be both interesting and interesting.
When she mentioned the media reports that touched her emotions, Kelly revealed that "very difficult" for her was the reporting of the bombing in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or injured children were watching our live program with Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of 16 children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked in her house for many hours.
The whole meeting was held quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, where I attended.
She added that "exquisitely difficult" was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCanny shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that "he really admires their strength and courage".
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter and, in addition, endure the most terrible comments online trolls.
I'm with them all my heart.
The program for the 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on television will start at 8:30 p.m. on Monday, September 30th at ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
A senior government official claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiweng had rejected the offer to take over President Robert Mugabe's office at the summit because he was afraid of being imprisoned to confirm the takeover of power by the military in November 2017.
As reported last week by "The Zimbabwe Independent," Mugabe offered Vice President Chiwenga to take over the presidency during his negotiations with the military during the coup.
However, a higher government official announced in the social media that Chiwenga did not reject the offer of fear, but because he had seen Mugabe’s plan to use it to prove to the world leaders and the African Union (UA) that he had actually lost during the coup.
On the Twitter website, which confirmed that the 37-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe wanted to transfer power to Vice President Chiwenga rather than to President Emmerson Mnangawa, Jamwanda 2, on which state officials confirmed that he was a senior state official in the Bureau of the President and the Council of Ministers, it was claimed that there were intensive negotiations at that time.
State officials claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiwenga through one of his envoys when he realized that the power was getting out of his hands.
Mediations between military authorities and the deceased former president were three stages, according to the senior government officer.
The official claimed that among the participants of the negotiations was President George Charamba, the person who was then the head of the Central Organization of Intelligence Aaron Nheper and the priest representing the bishop of the Roman Catholic Fidelis Mukonori.
The former head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him with a one-man mission to hand over a bid to President Chiwenga, who was head of the Zimbabwean Defence Force (SOZ).
A man who, after his death, was even more regarded as an icon of Africa in vain as a military condemnation by the UA, trying to get other African leaders to intervene.
The offer of the president, made by the deceased (Mugabe) to the then Chief of Defence Forces (SSO) Chiwenze, was not based on choice.
“It was a desperate act to save a situation that took a dangerously fast pace, removing part of the deceased’s family,” wrote an official (Jamwanda).
But there was also a bit of political temptation with which the dead wanted to reverse the situation in a completely non-mocratic way.
It is enough to remind ourselves that the commanders have declared that they did not overthrow and overthrow constitutional order, which would cause their conflict with the UA's position on the coups.
The deceased (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, violently breaking the leaders' claims that they had not overturned the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, by the way, was still highly confused with the whole situation and the way it fit into its theoretical reverse taxonomy, would then have no other choice but to describe it as a coup, so the call for military intervention would be credible.
It is in this spirit and with such a determination that this offer was made.
Officials said Mugabe made this move when he realized that the defense forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a letter of resignation after warning the strongman that he was risking Gaddafi-style lynch.
The military chiefs told him they wouldn't return the rifle against the citizens if they moved to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time Mugabe had two desires, namely to save his family and to prove that the army took over", added the official.
The then SSO and the commanders correctly read the assumptions.
The Emissary (Gno) who carries this desperate message was given to us – through a powerful metaphor – that Isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the Camouflaze sect, i.e. the military), we are neither politicians nor compete with each other at political level, claimed by a higher government official.
State officials say that the military has notified military commanders in the area through the attaché, who have been in Zimbabwe, that they do not intend to overthrow Mugabe, but to deal with the surrounding "criminalists".
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to re-tast Mnangagwa to return from short exile in South Africa so that they could talk about reversing and success.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
Residents of South Africa, which is a key part of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because Jacob Zuma was President of Sadc at that time – refused to intervene, but clearly indicated that if the military invades the Mugabe house, as many times threatened in the background, the troops of South Africa would appear immediately in Harare.
“It didn’t work because Putin and the African leaders didn’t choose this route,” said an informant, “the Independent.”
China needs strong leadership or will "result" as stated in the policy document
China needs a strong, unified Communist Party leadership, because otherwise the country “falls apart” – the government stated in its policy paper on Friday 70th anniversary of the creation of the People’s Republic.
The Chinese government’s press office reported in the White Paper that the country’s successes since the Communists took over 70 years ago have led to party leadership.
China has a large area, it has complex national conditions, and the administrative difficulties are rarely seen here.
The document mentions that without the unity and strength of China's leadership, they will move towards division and dissolution, which will be catastrophic to the world.
The Chinese authorities have long been using a firm hand policy to address problems as if it were to suppress pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping, who will be at the forefront of the celebrations of the second-largest of the world economy, has, since taking office at the end of 2012, further strengthened the governments of the party and imposed sanctions on those who may challenge power.
Xi is also overseeing the military modernisation programme that has offset this region's balance.
The document states that China does not seek to export its development model nor does it want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace and not "hegemony".
The Chinese don't have world domination in the genes of other nations or dominance.
In modern times, China has been oppressed by great powers, and wars and unrest have pressed a deep mark upon them as a result of the sufferings experienced; China will never give others the suffering they have suffered.
China is about this anniversary in uncertain times for a country in bitter trade war with the United States and facing the challenges of a freeing economy, as well as anti-government protests in the subordinate China of Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never "trade" its most important interests or allow anything to harm their sovereignty.
With regard to the trade dispute between the country and Washington, the document states that "the danger of trade wars and further increases in tariffs do not lead to problems".
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete chain of industry, a wide market space and a strong pace of economic development.
The document added that "commercial wars will never weaken it".
China is confident that it is capable of facing difficulties, turning the crisis into new opportunities and opening a new world.
It was also added that the United States should take a reasonable look at China’s development, as China does not intend to challenge the position of the United States or to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and even less likely to stop China's development.
The reduction and weakening of other countries and the transfer of national misunderstandings abroad will not provide the United States with a strong position.
The world of Jack Pałkiewicz: Dubai, real face
Dubai is a place still seeking its own identity, torn between Bedouin tradition, Islamic religious radicalism and progressive extremism.
This trend-setting leader of global tourism stimulates imagination and desire, loving the futility of wealthy snobby hotels and attracting the looking fortunes of investors and merchants in the status of a tax haven.
The web pages infect the enthusiasm of this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated concentration of the architecture of the 21st century in one.
The rich in sand have become Eden for those who love the rest, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and swimming pools situated hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many are delighted by the ubiquitous here, appreciates creative hyperactiveism and histerical pursuit of avant-gardeism.
Here is a city whose motto says all: "surprising, stunning and enchanting."
And almost every step of the way.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without character.
According to the British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the full extremes and contradictions of the metropolis have taken the dimension of the cheap grotesque.”
She turned into a futuristic nightmare, completely dominated by the Guinness Record Book, an unofficial constitution.
Because everything here must be bigger and prettier than anywhere else in the world.
There is, however, a lack of something in the old Europe that is perhaps not transparent, but relevant for the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels at home.
And in Dubai, I'm sure you don't.
By fleeing from the world of magic, I broke his golden mask, revealing the second face of artificial paradise.
A face you don't talk about or write about.
I am showing the misery of Asians contrasting with the fairy tales of the divine ethnic caste of Dubai, the grandsons of the illustrious Bedouins.
I am in a place of extreme poverty, for example, to the ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where an army of Asian workers live in cruel conditions.
It was they who built the desert sky of Manhattan in slave conditions.
They came here with good earnings and the ability to make a decent life for their families, and they had a nightmare.
This tourist will never see because it could blow up the air created over the years by the myth of Dubai.
The increasing criticism of the international community makes the topic of cheap labour highly troublesome for the emira.
Mel C of the Spice Girls team banned conversations about diets in her home after her struggle with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm of Spice Girls admitted that there was no dietary ban at her house after she had faced eating only fruit and vegetables for years.
Spice's sports haven't eaten for years and "obsessively practiced" as a result of the pressures of being a member of the world's famous pop group, which later caused depression and malnutrition.
Today, she reveals that her experiences affect the way she raises her daughter Scarlet, so she “does not let diets be mentioned in her home.”
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I am beginning to see that she is more aware of her appearance" - said Mel.
"I believe that one of the positive experiences of eating disorders is that I am very aware of the way I speak with her.
The use of a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview for Women's Health Mel magazine, who gained fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that, in the days before social media was created mixed in the press, "disturbing" comments on her were caused by complexes.
“I started to look at myself inappropriately, giving up on certain food groups, practicing increasingly obsessively, until I started having a lack of weight,” he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted a few years."
A picture that has shaken the world
Polish girl and American documentaryist gave the world a witness about the atrocity of war.
Legendary picture of Julien Bryan can be seen in the World War II Museum in Gdańsk
“Listen to my story.
I speak from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, it must help!", began his radio appearance documentary, photographer, Julien Bryan.
On the tragic September 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, seeing the drama of the bombarded city and its inhabitants.
His relationship was reflected in a broad echo in the West.
President of Warsaw Stefan Starzyński first helped him, borrowed his car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a suicide note to his family in the United States, deposited it in the embassy's safe and... stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be anywhere where the Warsawers were.
400 planes and artillery almost non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan put death on the pictures, suffering, the struggle to survive in the city's ignoses.
Just before the surrender, he and the ambassador's staff took the negatives out from behind the ocean.
He didn't stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What has happened to Warsaw will meet Paris, London, and even New York.”
His shocking chronicles were seen by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began to prepare for war.
“ Dad showed the truth and thus fought German propaganda.
They made films glorifying their chivalry.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
Prosecution before the jury against the former athlete for numerous rapes
There's a case of rape brought about by the former baseball team of Delaware University, which is being charged with multiple sexual assaults.
On Friday, after 10 days of testifying and hearing arguments, the jury members began to settle Clay Conaway's 23-year-old fate.
A 21-year-old woman claims that Conaway raped her when she went to his home in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after these two contacts were made on the Bumble meeting page and sent to the woman by the man the naked photo.
The woman is one of six accused Conaway of sexual assault in the years 2013-2018.
According to the plaintiffs, the hugging that a woman agreed to turned into rape, which met her opposition.
The defenders refer to the conflicting relationships between a woman and a gap in memory, and claim that a woman probably regretted that an intimate approach had taken place.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for one million zloty
The gold-covered bike worth a million zlotys was available at the 10th edition of the International Bike Fair Kielce BIKE-EXPO.
It's a unique vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His designer, a 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz, has just received a bicycle Oscar at the Las Vegas International Custom Row Exhibition.
- The bike is covered with gold spray chrome, under which is the highest test of silver.
It's an unusual coating made by a friend of mine from Zor.
“There is a saddle, there are pedals, there is a steering wheel, it could normally be driven.
It could go 50 kilometers an hour.
It's an electric bike," it explains its constructor.
“The bike car was printed on a 3D printer.
They're cubes that form a kind of vortex.
I came up with the idea of this model riding my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on a card and hid it deep into the drawer.
The sketch waited five years for the implementation.
The bike itself was built for three years", added Adam Zdanowicz.
"It was cruelly difficult to hide all elements under the bodywork.
There are batteries, wires, components that make up the structure.
It is hidden under the body of the 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
The engine's hidden there, too.
The driver for this bike was set up a week before I left for the United States at the World Rower Show.
I couldn't quite decide what this steering wheel was supposed to be.
She's a transporter.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms", summarizes.
The gold-covered bike was appreciated in Las Vegas by the most important competition category "Best amazing single customer".
Film material shows strong contamination of popular tourist destinations
Sydney Bay surrounded by an opera building, Luna Park, a port of Circular Quay amusement park, and of course the famous Harbour Bridge makes an important contribution to 21.9 billion dollars annually pumped into the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
However, the ugly truth lies under the bridge.
Sydney’s famous bay is one of the most contaminated waterways in the country to which the amount of pollution is affected annually equal to the capacity of about 15 Olympic swimming pools.
These horrifying statistics make one of our largest tourist assets at the same time one of our most dirty aquariums.
According to the new film material entitled “The Gulf of Sydney – upstairs and below”, the waters in Australia’s most popular city are full of non-doves, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, and all of this flows into the bay along with rainwaters.
However, the largest component of our shipping canals is plastic.
“I would call it a paradox,” says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, Deputy Director of the Sydney Harbour Research Programme, with a intention to coincide with the World Tourism Day.
This akwen looks beautiful, but it is one of the most changed and contaminated escape rivers along our coast.
CSIRO estimates that about 1560 kg of plastic enters our waterways every hour, and most of it affects the cove through storm draining.
"After such a great amount of rainfall... it looks rather tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as in the case of the iceberg, the problem with the bay Sydney is much more serious than the surface of the water, as 70% of the plastic that goes into the ocean is at the bottom of the sea.
"In my opinion, unless you spend time underwater, you cannot really realize what is in there deep," said Richard Nichols, the owner of the Dide Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his team are self-inflicted with about 500 kg of plastic per year.
I think that if more people knew (what is under water), they would just be terrified.
It's overwhelming... more than half of what we find on the bottom are plastic nets.
The other 50% are things that are made of at least plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all that other garbage is mined right out from under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and director of Ocean Protect, stated that there are ways in which people – both local and tourists – could help reduce the amount of plastic and leftovers in our waterways.
"This must begin at source" he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, better keep the materials recovered, and be more aware of what we put into the sewers that eventually hit the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we will be destroyed because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and our source of food.
But we can sort out this bay and bring it back to its former glory, and it's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.
The film material financed by the TOMRA recycling company as part of its wider efforts to education Australians in the field of environmental protection and to reduce the negative impact of containers on beverages, which often enter the environment, coincides with the research on the relationship between plastics and mental health, the results of which were published this month.
A new survey of 546 children aged 12 to 18 has established that 82% of respondents feel helpless for plastic waste and 25% adult blame for the problem with waste from disposable plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth biggest concern of parents, and 93% of the 551 surveyed parents said that their concerns about the amount of plastic waste entering the oceans were increasing.
Many people who took part in the study said that they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes, which led to ecological fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memes after volleyball game in semi-final ME
It wasn't an easy match.
On their part, the Slovenians had a natural audience, which effectively deconcentrated the Polish retinas.
There was a lot of controversy among judges, who in one of the shares did not count four reflections on the host side.
It happened at the key moment of the first set when Vital Heynen's caretakers had a chance to jump off the rivals and win the first game.
However, this was not the case, and the Poles eventually had to recognise the height of the rival, which after winning 3:1 will play the finals of the tournament.
Ghana: Traders from Kaneshie support a psychiatric hospital in Akra
The members of the Kaneshia Market Association donated food worth 30 000 GH yesterday? To the psychiatric hospital in Akra during a short ceremony held in Akra.
This is part of the activities of the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshia Market complex.

Google creates a cloud in Poland.
Partner of PKO BP
The operator of the National Cloud, PKO BP and PFR, has entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
The products of Google Cloud Platform will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator and Google will open the so-called Google Cloud region – i.e. hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and Central and Eastern Europe region.
The Google Cloud region will be the first installation of a global public computing cloud in Central Europe.
The digitisation of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions behind the project of the creation of the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polska and by the Polish Development Fund, the shareholders of this company.
The partnership of the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the road, which we set out less than a year ago, declaring the establishment of the National Cloud Operator.
The goal remains unchanged – digitisation of the Polish economy and dynamisation of its growth.
“Now Polish companies will gain additional sophisticated tools for its implementation.
By using them, they increase their chances of promotion to the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google joins them today really strengthens our joint project", says Zbigniew Jagiełło, President of PKO of the Polish Bank.
The Polish Development Fund notes that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
"Investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally integrated into the PFR strategy as an important element of the country's digitisation.
It will provide modern and affordable solutions to entrepreneurs based on cloud architecture.
“I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and attract the best specialists to it”, adds Paweł Boris, President of the PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all the key products of Google Cloud Platform such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner or BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud in the offer of National Cloud will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that benefit from their global competitors.
Thanks to us, however, they will remain in the Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators", notes Michał Potóczek, President of the National Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends such as IoT, which repeatedly increase the need for the computing power needed for the processing of huge data.
VI General Polish Parade of Seniors
At noon, 24 August 2019, at Ronda de Gaulle in Warsaw, the VI Parade of Seniors began "Matured Magnificent" and the Picnik of Generations, events organized by the Foundation of The Activities.
According to Przemysław Wiśniewski of the Foundation: “The parade is a world-wide event.
The sixth time has passed through the centre of Warsaw to demonstrate how large and diverse communities are.
Through the Parade, we are combating harmful stereotypes affecting the elderly and calling for intergenerational solidarity."
The parade was led by a special floor coach serving as a musical mobile scene, on which the famous DJ Wika has traditionally appeared.
Participants in a joyful corvod, on the second known Warsaw and world beats, passed by Alejami Jerozolimskimi, ul. Kruą do Plac Powstaców Warszawa, ul. Mazowiecka do Plac J. Piłsudskiego and ul. Králka and Krakow Subcity on the main campus of the Warsaw University.
In the course of the march, in which there were several thousand seniors representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, the colorful delegations were welcomed by the applause gathered on the route of the march, Warsawers and tourists.
Two organized groups in the company's yellow and blue T-shirts took part in the parade.
The first to represent the University of the III Age and the Senior+ Club and the second to be called the SAGA, the Senior Group of the Animators.
In the university campus, organizers prepared, among others, gastronomic stalls and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering seniors services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, at the stand of the Stylish Seniors of the Senior Voice from professionals Hanna Piekarska and designer Agnieszka Wyrał, you could get tips and information on current trends in fashion 60+.
The exhibition also offered a workshop of learning to move around the stage and pose for photos.
The finish was a fashion show of Stylish Seniors.
The latest edition of the magazine and materials concerning the campaign "Stop manipulation – Do not buy the presentation!" was published at the stand of the Polish General Voice of Senior.
Other stands offered cosmetic, movement, plastic and artistic workshops.
A few could be researched and consulted with professionals on health and nutrition issues.
There were also discussion panels, including Helena Norowicz, Beaty Tadli, Mario Bojary-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacykow and Robert Janowski.
There were no vocal and musical attractions on the picnic.
On the stage there was a legend of the Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk, and in the evening there was a intergenerational dance, which led DJ Wika.
Tasmanian devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasmanian devils may have the key to treating cancer – researchers have made a breakthrough discovery that can revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered how to mask some cancer cells
The researchers found that the same process occurs in the Tasmanian devils and in humans.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new treatments for cancer patients
What do Tasmanian devils and humans have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including those from Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the therapy of some cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also include the key to treating deadly face tumors that threaten the future of the Tasmanian devil.
The study determined how to mask some cancer cells in both humans and cysts, using a group of proteins called PRC2 that would otherwise turn off a marker that would give the immune system a signal to attack the cancer.
This may be the biggest challenge in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastomas and skin cancers, called Merkel cell carcinoma.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immune resistance to immunotherapy, we can be able to reverse this process", said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapy can be directed to re-initiating markers, a protein called MHC, which allows the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
“Perhaps this has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer,” said Professor Dawson.
“It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we can cure her much better.
The researchers also hope that the discovery will be used to treat the face tumors of the Tasmanian devil, where cancer cells similarly avoid detection.
"The unusual thing is that exactly the same process occurs (in the case of cancers in humans and Tasmanian devils)", said Professor Dawson.
“So far, it has been very difficult to treat Tasmanian devil tumours.
But if human medicines can also be used in Tasmanian devils, it is possible that it will help control the disease."
Scientists are astonished at the fact that a very large planet is around a really small star.
Scientists express surprise at the discovery of a solar system located 30 light years from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the processes of planet formation, because in this system a large planet similar to Jupiter revolves around a small star called the red dwarf.
Artistic illustration of the gas-type planet GJ 3512b circling a central star being a red dwarf, published on September 26, 2019.
Generally, stars are much larger than even the largest planets around them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case the star and the planet are slightly different in size.
The size of a star named GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet that revolves around it is at least half of the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it is an absolute surprise," said Astrophysician Juan Carlos Morales from the Catalan Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute for Space Research, who led the research published in Science magazine.
The discovery is surprising because the theoretical models of solar systems suggest that low-weight stars are usually parent stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we have discovered a gas-type planet with a giant similar to Jupiter circling a very small star", added Morales.
This planet, which, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It orbits its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full circle lasts 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The star GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the sun, but to some extent it is comparable to the size of a very large planet, as it is only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paler than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 degrees Kelvina (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Fahrenheit).
"That's why they're red" - said Morales.
"There is evidence of the existence of a second planet around this star, while the third planet could have been thrown out of the star system in the past, which could explain the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jupiter," Morales said.
Planets are created from the same interstellar gas and dust drive that gives birth to a star around which planets are circling.
According to the leading model of planet formation called the acretion model, the object initially arises from solid particles in the disk, and the gravity force of the planet at an early stage of development allows the formation of an atmosphere from the surrounding gas.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called gravity instability.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around a young star may be a little more massive than we expected and may be cold," Morales said.
This leads to a problem in the stability of the disk and therefore some denser areas may occur.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form a planet.
An employee of the delicacies accused of administering a meth-containing dipu-foamer
The Sheriff's office in Marion County has been held by Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years old, for the administration of a methamphetamine-containing methamphetamine dipu companion.
On Thursday, from Albany, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was accused of delivering methamphetamines and causing consumption of that substance controlled by another person – both crimes are second-degree crimes.
The charge was made on the basis of the event of 9 September at the Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
In a statement made under oath by OregonLive.com, which indicated the likelihood of guilt by a 27-year-old female suspect, she told the deputy sheriff Marion County that she saw Medina-Hernandez making a dip beans, which she then had enjoyed.
According to the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, which, according to what she provided, never took methamphetamine, said that "she thought that one piece eaten by her tasted strangely, but it did not raise any suspicions."
When she got back to work, she felt that she had a stomach upset and that she couldn't stop.
According to the newspaper Albany Democrat-Herald, she went to a local hospital where it was found that bean dip could contain methamphetamine.
According to reports from The Smoking Gun, another Thriftway employee reported that Medina-Hernandez “said that she would add drugs to food,” while another person admitted that the suspect had sent her a message, claiming that methamphetamine had reached the beans dip by accident.
OregonLive informs about the recording from the delicacy monitoring, which allegedly shows how turned back to the Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the bra, becomes behind the microwave and leans.
Then it's straightened out, wipes its nose, comes up to the table and folds dip beans in a small paper vessel.
According to the police, the thing she pulled out of her bra was probably also on the plate.
Oregon Stateman-Journal reports that the sheriff's office is saying that there is no suspicion at present that customers are given contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County, where the deposit is set to be $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that a woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, delivery of methamphetamines, theft, possession of methamphetamines and possession of illicit weapons.
Johnson is giving a blow to a deferral confusion.
Boris Johnson's journey to the United Nations General Assembly was inexorably interrupted by the historic judgment of the Supreme Court.
However, his crushing speech in the House of the Municipalities did not betray either shame or guilt.
To explain the meaning of this breakthrough, Tony Connelly, the editor of the European RTE section in Brussels and the London correspondent Sean Whelan in Westminster, is in the eye of the cyclone.

Marian Banas.
What's the KAS doing with the head of NIK?
Property rental for an amount below market price – these are reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasia.
What the Treasury is doing on this matter was asked at the Chamber of Treasury Administration in Krakow and at the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel in the report for "Supervizjera" TVN expressed doubts about the claims made by the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasia.
The Central Anti-corruption Office has been investigating them for several months.
The audit is due to be completed in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a house with a surface of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65.7 thousand zlotys per year.
The report "Supervisioner" revealed that the hotel was located in the house rented by him for hours.
The head of NIC later explained on national television why he only took over 5,000 zlotys a month for renting real estate.
"Gazeta Wyborcza", referring to experts on property valuation, estimated that it should be 15,000 zlotys per month for the building itself.
“The amount was lower for a simple reason: I concluded a preliminary agreement and just that the tenant was to buy this building, it caused me to agree on a lower rent that the remaining claims would be settled on the sale of the house”, Banas argued.
However, there were doubts as to whether such an action was not a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, spokesperson of the Chamber of Treasury in Krakow, informed in the TVN24 that "the matter is directly dealt with by the Ministry of Finance".
"All these questions please address to the Minister for Finance," he added.
He explained that in such cases "action leads the National Treasury Administration".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance Paweł Jurek admitted that the National Treasury Administration is monitoring many matters that may raise concerns.
“The national tax administration works in such a way as to have its own information, as well as in a sense based on information that is publicly available.
On this basis, he decides whether or not to conduct a specific case," explained the spokesperson of the IMF.
"At the same time, because we are all bound by a tax secret throughout the Ministry of Finance, we never speak because we cannot speak on individual matters of a particular taxpayer, a particular person or a particular company", he stressed, asked about Marian Banasia's case.
The Minister for Finance Jerzy Kwieciński stressed that "tax offices do not provide such news to the public".
"It is well known that the entire cashier deals with very many similar cases throughout the country," he pointed out.
Secrets of the royal family: Surprising guests of frequently flying royal aircraft have been revealed
As part of their duties, members of the royal family must travel hundreds of trips around the world during their lives.
This usually makes it easier for a royal plane – a private machine that carries a royal family around the world with important events and speeches.
It is not surprising that having your own plane involves privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long queues for check-in, their limits on the number of luggage, and, as it turns out, they can invite any guests on board – including truly unusual ones.
According to the recently premiere of the Channel 5 documentary film, not only the queen and Prince Filip often travel on a royal plane.
During the program entitled “Secrets of Royal Flights” were the queen’s flight navigator, he revealed that furnant guests were often flying along with the royal family.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes, together with our very important royal guests, they could fly very important royal dogs. ”
It is not surprising that the Queen may wish her beloved favorites to accompany her travels because she is known for her deep attachment to Corgi dogs.
Since the youngest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a lover of these four-legged creatures and hears that she has owned more than 30 corgis since the coronation.
It is said that in 2007 it had five corgis: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
Five sleepers joined them: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spike and Span, as well as four dogs that are the crusaders of the core: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The royal plane crew must have had her hands full.
A staff member of the royal house who brought dogs and asked them to get their needs before taking them aboard the plane – he continues to say, "Shields".
It's nice to say there's never been an incident.
The programme also reveals a shocking number of luggage that the Queen takes with her on board while travelling in the exercise of her duties.
Narrator said: “In 1953, the queen took 12 tons of luggage on her journey. ”
To be able to better display, it's about the same as two huge elephants.
But the queen is not the only one who has a weakness for fashion.
It is said that the Duchess Cambridge also has its own pleasure in transporting her wardrobe – it is said that there is a separate seat for each of her dresses.
The new law enters into force.
The victims will receive pensions.
On Friday, a regulation enters into force to ensure that pensions are paid seriously to the victims – the Financial Ombudsman informs.
This is the Act of 9 July 2019 on the specific rights of victims in the event of an exhaustion of the guarantee sum fixed under the rules applicable before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
They were then definitely lower than the current guarantee sums, hence in some cases insurers have already ceased to pay their pension.
"I enjoy this regulation because our institution has been working for many years to create a mechanism that will ensure that the financial support from the OC insurance or the farmer's OC insurance is guaranteed," says Aleksander Dashewski, legal advisor at the Financial Ombudsman's office.
In the view of the Financial Ombudsman, this was necessary because these are often very tragic situations of very poor health, which, due to the accident, cannot work, but at the same time bear significant costs for accidental rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them no longer received compensatory pensions and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sum on the OC policies.
Some of it has threatened in the coming years.
By 1 January 2006, the liability limits of the insurer were significantly lower than the current ones.
Therefore, the problem of the exhaustion of the guarantee sum in previous years was most often affecting people who suffered damage in the 1990s.
The guarantee amounts were very low at that time, and economic conditions resulted in an increase in prices.
"We have also noted that this problem has also affected a number of mostly young people who have suffered damage during the period when the sum was 350 000 for each victim in the accident.
Today, it is EUR 5.21 million per event, regardless of the number of victims.
This is therefore a huge difference in relation to earlier periods, hence the problem required legislative intervention", recalls Alexander Dashewski.
It explains that, given that the guarantee sum is increasing every now and then, the legislator has accepted that the upper limit of liability of the Insurance Guarantee Fund will be the guarantee sum applicable at the time the claim for payment of the pension is sent to the Fund.
This rule applies if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the pension on the basis of a court decision establishing a different guarantee amount than that laid down in the OC Insurance Agreement.
This is the case in the event of an increase in the amount of the guarantee by court pursuant to Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which makes it possible to modify the existing liability.
“In recent days, we have sent letters to people who have in the past requested intervention.
We inform them of new powers and, of course, we provide for the possibility of further support in the event of any problems", says Aleksander Dashewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting off the boy's penis
The case concerns events of November 2017.
According to Buenos Aires Times, that's when Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed a friend of the sextems that was created in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old who was an architect of education explained to the court that her partner had ruined her life and treated her like a "trophysic" that could be boasted before her friends.
"He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
She destroyed everything," she argued.
Cordoba's apartment decided to do justice itself.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him she had prepared a special surprise.
With the velvet belt, she covered his eyes, then grabbed the sectarian and cut off his penis.
“I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, pull up my pants, and I grabbed my cell phone to call 911," he testified.
“I wanted to leave, but she began to insult me.
She grabbed my shirt and my hair, not letting me go," he added.
Even though Barattini explained that her boyfriend hurt her by revealing her sex tape, she didn't try to escape from responsibility.
"I ask for justice," she said in the direction of the jury.
In the end, she was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Congressman of the State of Alabama Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, a retired Congressman from the Republic Party, Jack Edwards, who served for 10 terms of office, died and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
Family spokesperson said Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after the fight against pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the U.S. Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans in the state of Alabama in the South by the fact that the party had won supporters here.
He served 10 terms in Congress.
According to a statement issued by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave to its lawyers and to their lawyers, Edwards replied that he would like to return courtesy.
"I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where the common debate and efforts to solve the problems of the country will return courtesy," said Edwards, according to his family statement.
The governor of the state of Alabama Kay Ivey said that Edwards served as a national with highest standards of honesty.
She added that at his part of the flag in the capitol state of Alabama they would be abandoned in the middle of the mast.
“He was the personality of a true civil servant and was the best husband of the state for Alabama.
Our state lost one of the most prominent politicians" - said Ivey in her statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed high appreciation for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling the Princess Sussex "a caretaker leader who breaks the patterns and makes our world a better place".
The Duchess and Prince Harry, currently taking a ten-day royal journey to South Africa with their son Arch Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a meeting with young people at the beginning of the week during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Majesty, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, "a caring leader who breaks the patterns and makes our world better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic post.
“While meeting with the leaders of Obama Foundation @ObamaFundation, or helping girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve, Obama added an inspiration to many people, taking a picture of Meghan’s smiling face with the leaders of the Foundation.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September edition of the British Vogue, a guest- Released former actress of the Suits series.
There was the first lady in the honest conversation about motherhood and how he changed it.
"To be a mother means bringing to the master of the art of forgiveness" - she said in Obama's interview.
“Motherhood has taught me that for most of my time it is my job to give children space so that they can explore the world and become who they want to be.
Not who I want to be, or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are in their hearts.
Obama, who knows from experience the pressures of being on the candlestick, shared the council with the princess during an interview with the Good House Keeping magazine.
“The stress you feel – imposed by yourself and by others – can sometimes push you down” she said.
“My advice is therefore to slow down and not rush into anything.
I spent the first few months in the White House worrying about my daughters, making sure they were doing well at school and making new friends before I took up more ambitious work.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa retains a permit to sell alcohol despite complaints about the owner’s attitude
WASHINGTON (AP) – The D.C. Commission for the Control of Alcoholic Drinks in Washington has rejected the request to verify that the local Trump International Hotel should lose the authorisation to sell alcohol due to the owner’s personality.
The Agency ordered on Wednesday that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis is unfounded, because most of them do not live in or own the district.
"The Washington Post" states that, for the second time, the plaintiffs have sought to withdraw the liquor sale permit for the hotel, referring to the provision in force in the district that the applicant for the alcohol sale licence must be a "good attitude".
The original complaint submitted last summer claimed that President Donald Trump was breaking the law and called for assault and repeated fraud.
The application was dismissed because the licence was granted before it was lodged.
The reason for the second action was the extension of the licence.
"The Sun": A devastating report considers the best-known police scandals in Cleveland to be the worst in the UK
The inspectors considered the worst police in the United Kingdom to be SKANDALS.
In the crushing report, the Cleveland Police Department found it inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley, Chief Inspectorate of the Police of Her Majesty, claims that there was a "significant deterioration" of standards in Cleveland's police service.
New calls have been made to resolve police services, led by five commanders in six years.
According to the report, the police have not made efforts to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Police Inspectorate of Her Majesty said: “Since our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration of standards.”
Commander Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year in the face of an investigation into "serious" but undisclosured, the charges of his actions.
Deputy Chief Adrian Roberts was suspended after being arrested on the charge of gross deficiencies.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood came before the Committee on Crimes for contributing her colleagues to sexual activity.
He's out of duty.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen of Torys said: “This is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for Home Office to intervene now."
Police Chief Richard Lewis said: “After the introduction of improvements, I take full responsibility for the conduct of police forces through change.”
We're visualizing the skatepark!
Will the youths finally meet?
Older people are disturbed by young people who are passionate about riding the scooters and skateboards, but they complain that there is no room for them in Olava.
For years, young people have been reminiscing about a place to ride rollers, skateboards, scooters, bikes.
The subject is still coming back to us.
For 10 years, we have been paying attention to this problem.
It's been loud again lately about the lack of a skatepark.
That's why we're going back to that and we're asking the Bureau what's next?
We remind you that a few days ago, there was a woman who was disturbed by young people driving downtown.
"I write on behalf of the residents of the block at Piłsudski in order to be interested in the situation of Oława young people", writes in the Editorial Board of Małgorzat.
“ The block residents called the City Guard many times ineffectively.
"I'm sending photos to prove these everyday situations in connection."
We asked the others about the matter.
Most unequivocally say that young people simply have no place to drive in the city, and for years they have been ineffectively demanding a place for themselves.
Avalanche of comments appeared under the post on Facebook.
In July, we wrote that there was a chance that the skatepark would be built in the Ołavestek town.
The mayor reported that the city had requested funding for the construction of a skatepark.
"The project, together with the permits, is ready to be consulted with young people.
On 28 March, an application was sent to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for funding the task of «Building a Skatepark in Oława» under the Polish Sports Programme", we were told at the Office.
Project total value: PLN 798 306.00
Amount of funding requested: 263 440,00 PLN.
Now we've asked you again at what stage the case is.
"We do not yet have information on the decision-making of the application for funding submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism", reports Elżbieta Bednarczyk, head of the Department of European Funds, Oława.
"The information obtained from the Ministry's staff shows that the final choice of all tasks under the Sport Programme should take place in October".
We also asked for visualization of the Olavian skatepark.
We present it below.
The youth informed the editor that next Saturday (28 September) they would collect signatures under the petition for the construction of a skatepark in Oława.
"The rebel youth saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they would organize a meeting," writes Santa Claus.
Signatures under the petition will be collected from 12.00 p.m. in the area of the Lidl market.
Polish Cup 2019/20: draw 1/16 final.
We know a couple, hit from years ago
It was one of the brightest rivalry in the extraclass.
The biggest legend has been a memorable 1996/1997 match.
On 18 June 1997, Legia took over at the old stadium in Łazienowska with a team in the previous queue.
Both teams shared a point.
The hosts had to win, the second in the order of the Polish Championship gave a point.
Up to 87 minutes Legia ran 2:0, but for five consecutive minutes there was an earthquake – Widzew scored three goals and enjoyed it.
The Łódź club went into more and more troubles for years, until it stopped counting on itself to fight for the championship and fell from the highest competition class.
For the last time, the two teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
The legia – along the way to the title – had two victories – 5:1 at home and 1:0 at the exit.
Back to elite
Currently, boating is fighting for a return to the national elite.
These plans have been delayed for at least a year, since in previous games they have not been able to advance to the back of the extraclass.
As a result of this failure in the summer occurred in the club's personnel revolution.
The authorities have changed, eventually they have been placed on Coach Marcin Kaczmark, and in taking the next step up the club hierarchy they are to help repaired in the league fights Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możdżeń.
So far, Widzew is fourth in table II of the league, but in the Polish Cup he defeated on Tuesday the Vice-Chaired Śląsk 2:0.
The legions of the same size were played on the desert of the Niepołomice.
Extractural start-up
The only pair made up of representatives of the highest class in 1/16 finals consists of its benieminek LKS and Górnik Zabrze.
The matches of this phase will take place from 29 to 31 October.
This year, the 1/8 finals were planned (3-5 December).
The final is to be held on 2 May at the National PGE in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "rebelled" and the impeachment investigation must take its course.
You never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are involved in trying to hide the facts, and the investigation may take time," said Pelosi in an interview for CNN in the Hill of Capitol.
"They are doing the work they have begun, keeping with the facts and time necessary to find them," she added.
According to the protocol issued this week by the White House, Trump asked the President of Ukraine Wolodymyr Zelenski to conduct an investigation into former Vice-President Joe Biden, a candidate from 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked Zelenski to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giulianii, as is the result of the protocol.
Trump denied doing anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Department of Justice notified a complaint from the signal concerning Trump's proceedings involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal notification.
After receiving a complaint as a complaint from the Intelligence Community officials, the Department of Justice stated that Trump's telephone call had not provided a criminal investigation into the financing of the campaign.
Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday the Intelligence Committee will decide who to call a witness.
However, she added that Barr said that "he had rebelled".
That's a long time ago.
“The Barra is mentioned in all this,” said Pelosi, referring to the mention of Trump of her Attorney General during the interview with the Ukrainian leader in July.
Interestingly, he was making decisions on how to handle a complaint.
Pelosi reported that "he's very afraid" of signal informants, whom Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that they had been dealing with spies differently in the past.
I think the President's words go beyond his responsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signalists play an important role in discovering – discovering crimes in our government", said Pelosi, adding “The President’s words on persons who can provide information signal seriously undermine the integrity of the government”.
On Tuesday, Pelosi made a historic step in the announcement of a formal investigation into illegal conduct based on the accusations of trying to put pressure on the foreign state leader in order to obtain political benefits.
The phone call was included in a complaint published on Thursday, in which the signalist claimed that Trump had abused his authority to "incline Ukraine to interference" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signist also argued that White House lawyers had officials remove the record of the conversations from the computer system, in which they were kept for the Council of Ministers officials, and put it in a system designed for sensitive information.

Possible ban on driving cars for excessive speed to the Crystal Palace Attacker Christian Benteke
Premier League stars to Christian Bentke, who has been caught twice over speeding up in the last two months, are in danger of driving.
The attacker Crystal Palace, 28 years old, confessed to driving a Bentley brand at 80 miles an hour on the ground with a limitation of up to 50 miles an hour on the A3 road in Richmond, southwestern London on 20 January.
Then, in March, the Putney cameras in southwestern London recorded the Belgian driving at a speed of 89 miles an hour, twice the limit of 40 miles an hour.
Bentke from Kingston Hill of Surrey doesn't have to stand up in Lavender Hill's Court of Peace this morning.
He confessed to both crimes at the beginning of July under a simplified procedure, under which lighter crimes are judged at a meeting conducted by a single judge of peace.

Ghana: Kofi Manu, concerned about the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, a football manager and a representative of the Sekondi Hasaacas club, raised doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for the upcoming elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the involvement of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In his interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would prove to be fair, as the outcome of the verification process is in his interest.
The Verification Commission should consist of neutral outsiders who do not show links to any of the members and who have not previously shown interest.
Davies, for example, employed NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer in relation to payments of 10 percent.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Verification Committee, because he has an interest in it", he claimed.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, the Director of the Olympic Games, had a conflict of interest on the part of the President on account of his association with the club, suggesting that if Palmer were to be the subject of prejudice and bias before the Commission.
As expected, the members of the Commission were to begin their work from yesterday, after their oath at the GFA Secretariat in Akra on Tuesday, 19 September, and finish on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and its members are consultants on corporate governance and lawyer Mrs Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Director of Marketing and Business and Richard Akpokavie, Sport Administrator and lawyer.
"SE": Kornel Morawiecki in a severe state in a hospital
Senior Marshal Kornel Morawiecki, the Solidarność legend and father of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, has returned to the hospital – says "Super Express".
Politician is in heavy shape.
78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki has been struggling with pancreatic cancer for many months.

But now the health of the Prime Minister's father has worsened considerably.
Kornel Morawiecki went to the hospital, and the doctors call his condition heavy.
The family of the senior marshal provided “SE” that the politician is conscious and fully aware.
Pancreatic cancer is not the only disease with which Kornel Morawiecki is struggling.
He also has heart problems, and in connection with the chemotherapy he's going through, including his kidneys.
Kornel Morawiecki is applying in this year's parliamentary elections for the term of office of the Senator in the letter of the PiS in Podlasia.

Israel: No agreement on the government of unity
The two main parties of Israel, the Blue and White Alliance and Likud, continued negotiations on Friday on the establishment of the government of unity.
The meeting, which took place after the President's mission of forming the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, did not result.
The talks considered the possibility of rotational leadership of the two parties in the government and the remaining of Netanyahu as Prime Minister, but – as the Israeli newspaper “Haarec” writes – there was no approximation of views.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of the Blue and Whites reported in the Communication that it had presented preliminary requests.
He accuses right-wing Likud of “earth in his positions”, demanding that his leader and former Prime Minister, Netanyahu, remain at the forefront of the government, and in his office – a former ultra-orthodox politician.
"From the very beginning it was known that the Blue and Whites would not agree on these conditions," she said.
In fact, in the interest of Netanyahu, he “want to lead the election to the second round in Israel”.
The leader of the Blue and White Benny Gantz refuses to support the government that Netanjahu would direct, as long as he is accused of participating in three corruption events, on the basis of which the prosecutor may formally accuse him of having been appointed at the meeting on Wednesday.
"The people and the Blue and White have obtained a sufficient majority in the elections on 17 September, which would allow them to share governments as natural allies, but it forces them to negotiate which none of the parties wanted", writes the EFA.
President Reuwen Rivlin has been trying to bring their positions closer together in recent days and has suggested that the Prime Minister should temporarily suspend his duties, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the accusations against Netanyahu were upheld and formalised.
There is no lack of Israeli analysts who think things are stuck in a dead end.
However, half of the Israelis, according to a survey published on Friday by public television, want to unlock the political situation in the country by establishing the government of unity under the rotating leadership of the change of Netanyahu and Gantz.
50.6% of Israelis are in favour of this solution, and 32.1% of the respondents object to this solution.
The survey shows a deep division in Israeli society – who should be the first to lead the office, 41.8% to support Netanyah, and 40% to Gantz.
In another survey published by the journal "Israel Hajom", the percentage of unitary government supporters is increasing to 63%, 60% are opposed to the new elections that would be third this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on September 17, Gantz won 33 seats in the 120-place Knesete, Likud Netanyahu won 32 seats.
Netanyahu and his traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 Members, while Gantz can count on 54.
None of the parties took up 61 mandates necessary to obtain the majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight against Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "it's time to check it out" when Wales faces Australia's final game of the World Cup, which can shape their fate in the tournament.
The victory of Wales over the "cities" would set this team up as a favorite for winning Group D and guaranteeing participation in a likely quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia beat Wales for the 14th time in the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be quickly sent to start with England in one eighth final.
“Let’s be clear, both teams want to try to get through it and find themselves at the head of the group” – said the Welsh fighter Tipuric.
In the past, there were some difficult results, but last autumn it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're going to be eager to take that victory from us, and we're going to have to bring it back.
By the time we got here, you knew this was gonna be a big start.
And now we're here, and it's really time to find out.
Wales has won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in the history of the World Cup – and it took place 32 years ago in the third place in the game when they defeated the "kangure".
And their total record under Coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three teams of heavyweight from the southern hemisphere.
Wales stopped a series of 13 losing test matches at Australia's hands last November, and Tipuric prepared to be among the few survivors of this 9-6 win, who will run off to Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric asked whether the team had experienced mental blockade before this victory, added: “It is hard to say.
These games are so leveled up that maybe... people expect some kind of mental lockdown to happen, I don't know.
At the end of the last game, we probably left about 15 points on the field, so the final score looks a lot smaller than it actually was.
If Wales triumphs, then the fight against Tipuric with the beloved Australian duo from the third line of the mill Michael Hooper and David Pocock during the arrest and defeat will be crucial.
Tipuric has played 67 matches in the colours of the team and has met with both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what awaits him.
"They are players playing in the seventh absolutely world class", he said.
When you play against world class third-liners, you always know it's gonna be a tough game to play.
These two continue to exist with the best players in the world.
You know what gameplay you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably better to feel rugby because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best players in the world and face challenges than to face the third line of the mill that's not that good.
It's worth playing against the best, and when you're struggling with these two, you definitely have to be in top form.
I wouldn't say Sunday it's almost the cup final, but it's an important game for us in this World Cup.
The impact is an important element of it.
When we build strength and constantly make great efforts, we will fly like wings and we will be hard to beat.

The premiere of the book.
"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk
They were supposed to be an elite organization of "men's parks."
They have accepted in their ranks those they despised.
Can crime combine more than national identity?
In your hands, we donate not another book on war or military issues.
We are giving a deep international study on non-German participation in Waffen-SS.
The historians from different European countries analyse the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, remind themselves of their activities and look at the recruitment processes at different stages of the war.
Did the Danish troops differ from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why have we failed to create a branch composed of Poles themselves?
What is the official historical narrative about collaboration in European countries today?
What happened to volunteers after the end of the war?
Among other things, the book "Waffen-SS" answers these questions based on solid research material.
We have sought to present a subtler and more balanced, closer truth of co-operation in Europe during World War II, trying to break the methodological limits of history and history through the presentation of a hearing by researchers from various countries. (...) While the fate of the major victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slavian people - are sometimes presented in comparative terms and/or transnationally, so many perpetrators are generally examined from a national perspective (if done).
"Total panic" when the White House is struggling to find arguments about impeachment
The White House officials will be soaked in thinking about how to resist the pressures that have been renewed on Thursday on impeachment, and one of the people familiar with the situation describes the feeling of total panic last week due to the lack of a plan to respond to the new reality.
This seems to increase the "restlessness, uncertainty and concern" – one of the people related to the White House thus describes the mood in the western wing – that the charges of an informant can seriously harm the President and the people of his surroundings.
The person said: “It is not very certain that there is nothing there. ”
The White House officials were still uncertain how to act, not only because there is no obvious action plan in this situation, but also because the charges are so serious that the standard methods for effectively avoiding the controversy of the President in the past may not work. "It does not seem to be something that will pass away with the emergence of the next cycle of the headlines of the message," the person said.
Another person who was familiar with the course of the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of shock", which is accompanied by increasing mistrust that, with the ongoing impeachment investigation, the likelihood that the president would be irresponsibly responsible and would become "sufferable".
This fear is shared by another spokesperson claiming that people from the President's surroundings expect him to show more "poor" behaviour, and the pressure on him will certainly start to grow with every day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises concern that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behavior and, in an unexpected way, erupt – this is a concern in the context of the electoral year both from the point of view of the presidency and the elections.
By facing the greatest threat in the presidency so far, Trump has been circling from attack to defence, again reaching for the strategy he has assessed as effective during Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia.
He tried to bolster his own request to the Ukrainian President to help investigate his political rivals to distract and direct it to the democratic and democratic candidates of Joe Biden and to discredit the informant as a leading party motive.
But while a lot of people in the White House are in a fight after Mueller's investigation, something changed this time – the consultants and consultants said.
The president, who is a sign of strength, showed the Wednesday press conference as defeated, said one of the people familiar with the situation.
While Trump was enthusiastic about the Russian investigation, he did not seem willing to answer questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the President's allies believe that it is possible to avoid damage and some of them are held by the fact that the informant had no first-hand knowledge of this controversial telephone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Zelenski – which, according to them, undermines his credibility.
And as is often the case, when the President is the object of the attacks, this fact is raised alive by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies related to the White House indicates that the results of the President's support polls are unbottledly high, and the impeachment will not have too much effect on the acquisition of new sympathians.
"There is no positive need to focus on the President's impeachment in the next four months", especially if the legislative programme makes it difficult and predominates the new cycle of message headlines.
Another spokesperson claims that those who maintained that impeachment would help the President did not fully understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
The concerned White House officials were looking for help with their advisors, filling up an impeachment response team.
According to a person with knowledge of the plans, taking into account that these efforts are in the early stages, it remains unclear, or any central leadership initiative will be taken and what form it can take.
This person stated that there is a belief that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a strong leader capable of carrying out an attack on PRs, which is a ripost for the publication of a pathogenic signal report and aimed at halting the momentum of democratics on the impeachment given by the disclosure of this report.
The spokesperson familiar with the situation states that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin declared that they were not going to disclose notes describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it was possible to feel that there was no way out and a document had to be published.
It is expected that the pressure will now be higher than during Robert Mueller's investigation, which mainly kept silence and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who could be involved in the development of the response to impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the dirty work of Trump and a former chief of the electoral staff, said the person involved in the case.
However, Lewandowski told NBC News that it is not true to suggest that he will be in charge of this action.
"For the past five years, I have done everything I can to support the president and his program," he said, "but I have not participated in any conversations with the president or his team about joining the team in order to resist the false narrative on impeachment."
Donald Trump's private lawyer from Mueller's investigation, Jay Seculow, also remains involved in impeachment activities.
"We respond to matters as they should" – Seculow responded when asked by NBC News for comment.
Currently, the White House feels the lack of an experienced lawyer in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked on Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, has left, and the current advisor, Pat Cipollone, has no such experience.
The spokesperson familiar with the White House's strategy stated that, in general, officials had not planned to engage people at any time or to create a command centre, but admitted that there was a need for a coordinated, joint response and a political struggle.
Explorer of the Seas line Royal Caribbean has been renovated for £89 million
Explorer of the Seas, a part of the Royal Caribbean International family, will go on a cruise this summer, presenting a completely new look.
After renewing the impressive 110 million dollars ($89 million), the ship admires the wide selection of culinary delicacies from all over the world and the rich offer of entertainment for the whole family.
This summer Explorer will stop at the biggest ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to taste the Mediterranean Europe.
When the adventure on land ends, the crew of the ship promises unforgettable impressions at sea.
With a rewarding offer for everyone, Explorer, after restoring the cost of 110 million dollars, i.e. about 89 million pounds, was transformed into a passenger ship that provided excellent entertainment for the whole family.
The impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board through advanced surfing simulators or watch their favorite family film, using weather charms, in the outdoor cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is to add virtual balconys that allow passengers cabins to admire their ocean views without having to board.
Water lovers will admire the newly designed deck by the pool combining the style of the Caribbean resort with the charms of the water park.
The swimming pool is surrounded by beach hammocks and sunbeds ideal for hanging out in the sun, and two modernized slides are within reach of people thirsty for strong impressions on board.
A trip attractive for passengers of all ages impresses the number of activities available to guests during their journey to destinations.
Made for the young Adventure Ocean for children is an opportunity for younger family members to spend beautiful memories, and an exclusive place to spend your free time for teenagers offers super games and a music zone prepared for people over 12 years of age.
If this turns out to be insufficient, the entire family can in "studio B" on the ship face a laser tag with light in the dark, which in an impressive way can also serve as an ice rink for skates.
During a cruise on the Mediterranean Sea, guests will also be able to experience exotic flavors from around the world by going to the slaughter of restaurants on board.
Modernized Asian cuisine is offered on a ship in Izumi Restaurant, and in the newly opened Giovanni's Italian Kitchen there is excellent food inspired by an innovative view of traditional Italian cuisine.
The remaining gastronomic points on board include the American restaurant serving Chops Grill steaks, Boleros, Scooner Bar and Johnny Rockets Express Bar.
Rejs, with the option of the seven- or nine-day route, sails out of Rome in May 2020.
As the second European ship belonging to the Royal Caribbean line, he will join the Allure of the Seas, which has also recently undergone an incredible renovation.
After the 58-day metamorphosis of Allure, totalling $165 million giant, the cruise operator offered to guests who had previously booked a voucher of $300 to be issued on board the ship.
The cruise operator stated: "Explorer of the Seas is the fourth ship of the Voyager class that will undergo the transition in the context of the modernization of the Royal Amplified fleet."
A program that requires investment of more than $1 billion, including 10 ships and four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of possibilities: from unique attractions to gastronomic experiences to nightlife.
Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats that they are demanding "a naked picture of Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes of California apparently cannot bear the naked truth about the investigation of President Trump.
In his Thursday defense of the President, he accused the Democrats of wanting to get naked photos of the President.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican sitting in the Board of Representatives' Intelligence Commission, made the above claim during the preliminary hearing of a signal complaint, as if Trump had asked Ukraine to assist in initiating an investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal the "grotesque show" of the left and their "median ace" before claiming that the Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in neglyze.
"Democrats in this committee have negotiated with people who, according to them, were Ukrainians to get a naked picture of Trump", said Nunes.
"People can rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to put the President in charge when they have their chance in a year.
When Nunes finished giving reprimands, the political reporter on HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats really tried... to discover.
Until now, only the representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, answered, although we suspect that his answer is the naked truth, as confirmed by many of his colleagues' thoughts.
Mediaite.com believes that Nunes' comments on nakedness referred to “the more reliable and unconfirmed information,” which is likely to appear in Steele’s controversial files,
This is a famous, gathered by former British spy Christopher Steele, a collection of charges against Trump, indicating the probability of a tape that shows him watching the urination of a prostitute in a hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research into renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesla have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be to avoid renewable energy – aircraft.
However, a professor at Albert University developed technology that will allow renewable biofuels to be used as an aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta at the Department of Agriculture, Life Sciences and Environment, who started working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory is developing hydrocarbons obtained from fat waste, such as restaurant fat, animal fat and rapeseed oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower-quality oils during production, with an estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than for oil fuels, as well as waste from other industries.
This technology has the task of imitating the hydrocarbons present in the petroleum fuels.
"What our technology has done in the first generation," said Bressler, "is [in total] hydrocarbons that are identical molecules as diesel fuel."
While this opens up a new possibility of using biofuels, pre-designed biofuels have tended to destabilise at lower temperatures, which was a serious threat to aircraft flying at high altitudes.
"The air fuel problem is a bit of a bad wheel", said Bressler.
It's actually less worth than the diesel, but it's got higher requirements.
The Bressler laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aviation biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach, which requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels and hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on the chemical properties that have already been partially developed, which will provide fuel with stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little" - said Bressler, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The scratch company set up by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working on commercialising the product, as airlines as well as the Canadian and American armies are increasing investment in renewables.
"They are able to imagine the times in which the situation may be reversed and the carbon tax imposed on them" - he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will be an emergency plan.
Forge currently runs a remote waste management centre in Edmonton, and has recently received a total of $4 million from Lockheed Martin in an investment to support the cost of a $25 million production plant located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce approximately 19 million litres of biofuels per year.
Bressler also notes that the expected carbon reduction will be around 85 percent, but issues such as transport and fuel production will stop further coal reduction.
“As a technology specialist,” said Bressler –
I have the task of developing options that enable informed decisions and many choices to be made."
FUTURE: Another granddaughter scam
8,000 zlotys and 750 euro lost Zamość's apartment thinking that she was helping her grandson who caused the accident.
The police reported the incident on Thursday, the son of a deceptive zaměstka.
“ On Wednesday, a woman was called by a man claiming to be her grandson.
He said he caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise, he's going to jail.
In order to help her grandson, she transferred PLN 8,000 and EUR 750 to the fake police officer who came to her house," reports Asp. Dorota Krukowska-Bubiła from the Moscow police.
The police are looking for the perpetrator, and they're calling again for caution:
‘Every telephone with a request for financial assistance must be verified.
You should not act under the influence of emotion and hasten.
Remember, cops don't ask for money and don't accept money.
If you receive a call asking for financial support, which will raise our suspicions you should respond immediately and notify the police by calling 911 emergency number.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about threats, let's tell them how frauds work.
Please be careful and not trusting people who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson' ally warns that if the UK's brexite is canceled, they're threatening to do a lot of things like Los Angeles, and he's calling for peace.
One of the chief ministers of the office said last night that the country was threatened with a "violent social gap" if the original result was questioned by the outcome of the second referendum.
The UK Prime Minister's allies from his immediate surroundings warned that the country was threatened by "yellow vests" protests in France due to social inequalities and riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for a “satisfaction of mood” during a turbulent argument on the political language, but stressed that he continued to use the word “suffering.”
Despite his call for peace, the Minister of the Office said "The Times": "There have never been protests like "gillets jaunes" ("yellow vests") or riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because it didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – gillets jaunes – using encrypted phones, through which they can coordinate peaks, and to push people into protest is enough for a few unforgivable populist leaders.
The riots in Los Angeles erupted after the jury acquitted four white policemen who beat up Rodney King's black cab driver in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow reflective vests – a guillet jaunes – have been desolating for more than six weeks and are destroying the streets of Paris.
The Minister referred to the warning by Johnson in the House of Communes and said that if Britain fails to leave the EU, there would be a "catastrophallous loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organise a referendum in which 30 million people will vote and 66% of them will support the UK's stay in the European Union, ten million people will remain unhappy" said the Minister.
Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, we will still have 100,000 angry people who will write to their messenger and who will not forgive.
A lot of people don't need to see tens of thousands of people on the street soon.
One of the main ministers of the office added that the country would be threatened by a "violent society" if the outcome of the first referendum was questioned by the second result.
Johnson called for a general election in which voters should decide the fate of lexit.
According to the reports, the Prime Minister is facing the risk of a cabinet in order to reduce demands for brilliance and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
The canteen, Chubówna, and Krosny were delighted in Krakow.
Behind us Talk'N'Roll
More than 300 participants were heard on Thursday (26 September) by 11 inspiring speakers, including Simon Holovnia, Krystyna Chubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
This was all under the Talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Extending the horizons, discussing the ideas of publicity and common discussions that can give impetus to further development.
This was the aim of the conference organizers Talk'N'Roll, inviting 11 exceptional speakers, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, including people known from the media - Szymon Holovnia, Krystyna Chubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
The theme of this year's Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the Future, the NEW", and just around the creation of the future, guests' speeches were focused on attending the conference.
The first session was opened by the Managing Director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who spoke about how the brand, which was built around him, could have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas went on stage to change the public's perception of rejection, claiming that they should be accepted if the future is to be created, in turn Chris Badura has taken on the subject of empathy in a time of rapid development of technology.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared views and techniques that can help manage a career and increase overall satisfaction by finding an appropriate balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multi-thread discussion with Krystyna Chubówna, which spoke about how the profession of a teacher in Poland changed from its perspective over the years.
The holder of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that – thanks to the technological development – everyone can today make it difficult for this profession.
However, he does not think that in the coming years a person in the position of a teacher is completely replaced by technology.
Right after her, Piotr Nabilec took up the problem of living in the time of the information, emotional overload, or overburdens in the matter of choice, giving the audience valuable guidance on how to deal with it, and Luke Łętoch in his speech spoke about what might lead to another industrial revolution known as "Industry 4.0".
Having fun teaching, teaching fun
The conference organizers also took care of artistic impressions by inviting an illusionist, Daniel Jenak, to the stage.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who first played with the audience and then, on an example of his own career, talked about how he was trying to maintain the right balance between his career on the stage and his private life.
The participants also kidnapped Simon Holovnia, stressing first of all the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can change the situation diametrically and you need to be ready to take advantage of this time.
Furthermore, Holovnia shared his thoughts about the reality surrounding us, calling attention to anecdotes that could cause a smile on the faces of the viewers.
The stage was then followed by Adrian Tworuszka, who reviewed the history and goals of several innovation models and referred them to how they are being used today.
At the end of Marcin Sloviak, on an example of Rubik's ankle, told us about the approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly brought something new to the perception of the reality of everyone who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the natural reactions and numerous questions to the guests show a great deal of public involvement.
The organizers provided a transmission to all those who were unable to participate in the event and the recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
Governments of law instead of rule of law.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to change the Constitution, the majority has introduced a number of changes to the state system, creating threats to the rule of law and the rule of the rule of law," writes the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights published on Thursday.
The report "The rule of law rather than the rule of law" documents, among other things, changes in the justice system and in the area of the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
On Thursday, the Helsinki Human Rights Foundation (HFPC) published a report entitled “The rule of law instead of the rule of law.
Risks to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015-2019."
The Foundation estimates in the report that in 2015-2019, the largest regression in the field of human rights protection was observed in Poland after 1989.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the majority has introduced a number of changes to the state system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of the tri-division of power.
In adapting the law to political objectives, the rule of law was replaced by the rule of law," wrote HFPC experts.
What's in the HFPC report?
The report documents developments in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as the public media and the Ombudsman) and in the area of the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarizes the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union for three years.
"In the last four years, we have seen for the first time and on such a scale the use of the right to pursue party interests.
This translated into the ongoing rule of law crisis, as well as the weakening of the entire human rights system in Poland", stressed the lawyer Marcin Freeny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years are "the period of systemic change in both the state" and "the protection of human rights".
Over the last four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 pieces of legislation which are essential for the protection of human rights.
"The changes were often accepted at an accelerated pace, without public consultation and despite the concerns of the legal environment, the Ombudsman or international organisations", explained the lawyer Małgorzat Szulek, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the last four years are: "depression of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), non-respecting binding judgments and recommendations of international institutions and undermining safeguards for the protection of human rights".
State authorities failed to respond
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs considered it particularly worrying "to be those situations where state authorities did not react or simply disregard the emerging cases of aggression".
The Foundation experts noted that some changes were made in the atmosphere by attacks on individual institutions or working groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of the state's activity in the field of restricting the rule of law is the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from international law entities.
"The lack of implementation of these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as a leader of democratic change in Central and Eastern Europe, but also puts the Polish state under the responsibility for violating the law of the European Union or the European Convention on Human Rights," says the report.
Brother of the Star of Pakistan Social Media with life for honorary murder
Women's rights experts say that investigation of justice is often difficult due to prolonged proceedings, the release of suspected killers on bail and the destruction of cases in public awareness.
“It takes so long for people to forget,” says Farzan Bari, the female rights defender and founder of the first gender studies department in Pakistan at the University, adding that even the widely-disciplined murder of Baloch has been resolved for over three years.
Although reliable data is difficult to determine according to groups fighting for women's rights, in 2018 the Pakistani Human Rights Commission concluded at least 300 cases of so-called honor killings.
Many activists claim that the actual number is significantly higher and the network promoting awareness of crimes of honorary motives estimates that around one fifth of the 5,000 honor killings committed every year around the world occur in Pakistan.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, transfers to the country are decreasing because many emigrants reside outside Poland permanently – says "Rzeczpospolita".
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries in 2018 amounted to over PLN 8.6 thousand, which means that almost one thousand zlotys increased, i.e. almost 12%.
Euro-Tax "estimates that the total income of Polish earnings emigrants in the EU countries reached a record value of PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, one year more than one year earlier", we read.
Director of the Centre for Research on Migration of the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk, says that Poles are getting better at the international labour market, where they take advantage of different options available.
"There is also a growing number of specialists and professionals who move from country to country in search of better conditions, as well as international corporate workers," reports the newspaper.
During the year, some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries, such as the UK and Germany.
“It is the most in RFN in 2018 because by 11% the total earnings of Polish migrants increased (up to nearly 27 billion PLN).
However, Poles made the most money in the islands – almost PLN 35 billion", we continue to read.
The President of Euro-Tax considers that despite improving working conditions on the Polish market, the number of economic migrants does not decrease.
In fact, still the sax in the West and the North of Europe (leading Norway) is often an opportunity for several times higher earnings than in Poland.
"And even with minimum rates in a given country, which e.g. in Germany is €9.5-11.7 per hour", says the journal.
"Rzeczpospolita" states that Poles remain not only due to higher earnings but also because they settled abroad.
Many Poles retain roots abroad, which is also visible after decreasing transfers of money to the country.
Those last year were the lowest in years.
As the economist Tadeusz Chrościecki, along with the extension of the period of staying abroad, a group of people transferring money to the country is decreasing and their height is decreasing.
"Emmigrants are bringing their loved ones together", reads on Friday's "Rzeczpospolita".
Prolonged monsoons cause flooding and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extended for almost a month, and the unprecedented rainfall has caused death due to the decomposition of buildings and the rotting of many crops.
Usually, in northern India, monsun resolves at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Weather Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be a monsoon at the latest for decades.
In many areas of the country, rainfall is still unusual – in recent times in the west of India, the town of Pune, Wednesday and Thursday rains, have led to the death of several people and desolation due to the collapse of buildings.
There was a flood of houses, people were taking people down the streets on their knees, which normally occurs only during the monsoon apogeum.
Major rainfall also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of long-lasting rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many houses have been destroyed.
Monsun also started with a delay.
In many areas there was no water, so farmers prepared for the likely drought.
Too long-lasting monsoon is not welcome by farmers.
This amount of rain isn't normal at this time of year.
“By him my vegetables – and now I have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes – will rot”, says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of the delayed and late ending monsoon means an increase in the price of onions, the indispensable ingredient of Indian dishes.
The onions that usually had to be paid for 20 rupees (0.23 pounds of British) currently cost 80 rupees (about 1 pound of British) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
Festivals and holidays are also at risk.
Another big festival, which is held on October 8, Dasara, during which the Indians raise huge pieces like from the comic book, depicting Ravana, a figure with a lush mustache and a evil smile from the epos of "Ramiana".
Ravana's smoking symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that the similarities of Ravana were made out of paper, if monsun continues to continue, Ravana will laugh at the last.

Doodle celebrates the 21st birthday of Google
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine we are looking for answers to all the tedious questions.
What are we looking for on Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How many?" are one of the favorite categories of Poles that are searching for.
The giant figures show that last year we were happy to ask, "Where is the storm?", "How to make a scraggle?" and "How many fingers does a horse have?", "How to get rid of fruit flies?", "How to eat cocoa?".
Today, the search engine celebrates its first 20th birthday.
Its users – and in Poland as many as 96% of people use "Uncle Google" – welcome Google Doodle today.
It's not animated this time.
Google reminds of its birthdays, showing a stationary computer with a monitor, a mouse and a keyboard, and in the lower right, a digital date was printed – as in the picture from the 1990s.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
The search engine was created for a specific purpose – to catalog all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term googol meaning the number of ten raised to the hundredth power.
This name was also intended to reflect the company’s intention to index as many sites as possible from global Internet resources.
Google was founded by Sergei Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which acted better than the method of normal aggregation of results on the basis of the frequency of the phrase.
At the beginning, the search engine was named BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of links to a given result.
Page and Brin founded a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon later launched the famous Google.com site.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, "PC Magazine" appears information about the extremely high relevance of Google's search results.
Then the history of the company looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with each month, conquering subsequent markets and increasing the company's value.
Already in June 2000, the Google URL index has over a billion positions, making Page and Brin's work the largest search engine in the world.
The company currently founded by Page and Brin is one of the leading players on the IT market.
Is there any other field to develop?
“The mission of Google is to organise global information resources so that they are widely available and useful, even though we have made great progress in this area, it is a very long way ahead of us to achieve this goal,” Piotr Zalewski of Google Poland provided in his conversation with “Newsweek”.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
A new study suggests that working with exposure to plant protection products at high concentrations may result in a high risk of heart problems in later years of life.
This is the case with a group of Japanese people in Hawaii who have been studied for more than 30 years.
Scientists found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more vulnerable to heart disease or stroke.
"This study stresses the need for personal protection equipment to be used for the time of contact with pesticides at work and the importance of recording in medical records contact with such devices at work, as well as the control of standard factors increasing the incidence of heart disease", said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
The results were based on data from over 6000 men on the island of Oahu who participated in the cardiological program Kuakini Honolulu.
As the researchers pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations, as it only concerned men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life breakdown, so their health effects can be known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez reported: “After 34 years of male observation, it turned out that the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant.”
This was probably because ageing factors became more important, which masked the possible causal relationship between exposure to pesticides and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases in later years of life.
Researchers have not found a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Phone call from Zelenski-Trump: Porshenko gives you its three cents
Waszyngton's policy has a turbulent week of launching the impeachment procedure against American President Donald Trump
A political scandal is a political scandal for the political debutant Wolodymyr Zelenski, which he would rather avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelenski-Trump and will it have far-reaching consequences for the first one?
Almost at the start of a phone call, Trump told Zelensk that the United States was doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes disclosed by the White House are not complete, they describe in detail Trump's attack on Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for the fact that German leaders and other leaders of European countries are engaged in negotiations instead of making concrete proposals.
Controversy raised the response of Zelenski, who said that he agreed with Trump not 100%, but 1,000%.
Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views has led politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, to decide to speak through social networks.
Mr Poroshenko, former President of Ukraine, said on Twitter that EU support was "unpreceded".
In other tweets, Poroshenko said that he was grateful for the EU's support for sanctions and financial assistance in the course of the "Russian aggression".
Others expressed their concerns, including the Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska said: “How can we now speak with Germany and France? ”
Then Trump mentioned military aid and asked Zelenski to investigate not one, and two cases: the first concerning Joe Biden – Hunter’s son – and the second related to the DNC breaking into the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker’s attack on the Democratic e-mail boxes during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether this will spoil European relations or break up relations with the leader of France and Germany.
I don't want to talk about anyone...
Thank you to all those who help us" - said Zełenski in New York after the publication of the call log in the United Nations General Assembly.
Zelenski is due to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of the "Norway Four", which is due to take place in October.
Former Voivodship Inspectors of the Law of the United States
The court cleared George Wisniewski of the alleged actions.
After 6 years Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally cleared of charges.
In Przemyśl, the District Court cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski, former Head of the Military Inspectorate for Trade Quality Agricultural and Food Articles in Rzeszów, on the charge of overshooting powers.
Lubelska's prosecutor accused him of betraying the regional marshal's term of control at a food oil plant.
The case has recently been subject to a judgment of adjudicating force.
The appeal was recognized on September 12.
“The court has maintained an acquitted acquittal judgment,” confirms Judge Małgorzata Reizer, spokesperson of the Court of First Instance in Przemyśl.
This is a judgment of 14 February published by the District Court of Industry.
Jerzy Wiśniewski then commented on Facebook: “It’s been six years since I was presented by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin for the alleged violation of law in a telephone call with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Region on 30 April 2012.
The court unequivocally stated that I was innocent and did not break the law at the time.
I was convinced that my phone call then with the Marshal of the Podkarpacki Region was in accordance with the applicable law.
The release of events that were published by the media in 2013 by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin was true and caused irreversible damage to both the food producer's operator and the loss of image of my person in my employers, among employees and the local community.
The act of prosecution, which was made against me in the opinion of the General Court, contained a number of errors, false facts, false terms of the legal basis, which were not confirmed in the reality of the events.
With the help of the CBA in Rzeszow, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
I was immediately released from work and deprived of funds.
I stayed for a long time to keep my husband."
Let us remind you.
Jerzy Wiśniewski served as the voivodship quality inspector for agri-food products between 2009 and 2013.
He was dismissed after the D.A. in Lublin presented him with charges in 2013.
According to the investigators, he was to betray the regional marshal (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to four years in prison) the term of control at the plant producing food oil belonging to the wife of the Deputy Marshal of Podkarpackie at that time.
This was a warning, as the prosecutors of Lublin claimed, that the owner of the company knew about the controls and adjusted the labels on the oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski heard the charge of overshooting his powers, threatening to be imprisoned for up to three years.
"I am relieved that this case has finally come to an end and my innocence has been confirmed by the court.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I did not do anything wrong, which is now the final confirmation of the judgment which acquitted me from the charges," comments Jerzy Wiśniewski.
The White House tried to hide a record of conversations with Zelenski
On Thursday's published report, the signalist wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking with the President of Ukraine, was seeking interference from a foreign state in the U.S. election, and the White House was trying to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the USA
In an anonymous report dated August 12, an interviewer, who is probably an interviewer, wrote: “As part of my duties, I was informed by many members of the U.S. government that the president used his function to demand interference of a foreign country in the 2020 elections in the United States. ”
“Trump used part of the conversation (from Zelenski) to pursue his own interests.
And precisely – he tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take steps to help the president in the re-elect in 2020, says the report, quoted by the newspaper "The Hill".
The Ukrainian leader was "explained" that contact with Trump was dependent on whether "the will of the will to take the game" in matters which President Rudy Giuliani’s lawyer was to inform him more precisely.
The author acknowledges that he was not a witness of the conversation, but emphasises that he was informed in detail of its content by "many White House officials who had direct information on this matter" and their relations were overlapping.
“In the following days after this conversation, I learned from many American officials that high-ranking White House representatives had intervened to “study” all archival records of this conversation, and in particular the literal entry that was written, as is usually done, in the White House’s crisis room,” we continue to read.
“High White House officials told me that the lawyers of the White House “commanded them” to remove electronic records from the information system in which such records are stored.
The record was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate sensitive information", wrote the author of the report.
“In my opinion, these steps show that White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversations,” said the speaker.
As AP comments, this document will probably speed up the proceedings on a possible President's impeachment and also provide valuable information about witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
The recording of the conversation with the Green White House, following the pressures of Congress, made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the relationships of those who witnessed it.
The content of the report, in a revised version, revealed the day later the House of Representatives intelligence committee.
On Thursday, Joseph Maguire, the director of American Intelligence, also testified before the Board of Representatives' Intelligence Committee and explained how he treated the employee's report.
Maguire said that the signalist made the right choice and did what the law ordered.
He also stressed that, in his opinion, the issue of speaking with Zelenski is an event "without precedent".
Democrats in the intelligence committee asked Maguire why he blocked Congress's signal report; the director of the intelligence replied that he had no authority to reveal its content, whose confidential nature guarantees the so-called privilege of executive authority.
Part of Maguire's interrogation by the committee took place outside the closed door.
On Tuesday, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reported that the President, in view of the suspicion that he had put pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rivalry in the next presidential elections, the House of Representatives, is initiating an investigation that may lead to the impeachment of Trump.
A day later, she assessed that the recording of Trump's conversation with Zelenski confirms that the President of the United States has broken the rules on elections and security.
U.S. electoral law prohibits the use of foreign state aid.
On Thursday, the spokesperson for the White House, Stephanie Grisham, said that there was nothing wrong in the conversation, and the report, "there is nothing more than a collection of relations with the third hand and the collided press clippings."
"The White House will continue to criticise this hysteria of the media and the false narrative promoted by the media of the mainstream", she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The safety prize was awarded in evidence that Ghana received the highest number of air safety oversight points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 percent in the field of temporary effective implementation (EI).
This occurred when ICAO completed its control of the ICVM on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Air Safety Supervisory Programme.
The Security Prize has demonstrated the recognition of the country's high commitment to the implementation recommended by ICAO of the standards and protocols for security at airports and in Ghana's airspace.
The award programme was developed to provide support for the ICAO initiative No Country Left Behind.
In addition, 16 other safety certificates and 17 security certificates were granted to ICAO Member States which improved their safety and security standards.
During the award for Ghana was the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of the Civil Aviation Authority of Ghana, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
The President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuyiv Benard Aliu, stressed in his speech the need for Member States to maintain safety in aviation.
He said: "It is important that we keep reminding ourselves that even in the innovation age aviation security and sustainability must remain our fundamental priorities".
For your part, Mr Adda noted that the prizes were a huge achievement of the state's efforts because they were a compliment for the hard work and endurance of the industry.
He also added that the aviation industry has a huge potential for the development of the country’s economy, saying: “Aerospace has powerful possibilities to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but everything is due to the security and security that we have achieved."
He was tanking and running, and he also stole his bike.
50-year-old from the town of Zamość drove his audi under the distributor, refueled and left without paying.
In this way, he robbed gas stations several times.
A man also stole a bicycle from one of the overseas offices a month ago.
The gas station owners valued losses for almost 1 000 PLN.
The owner of the stolen bike – for PLN 2 000.
On Tuesday, one of the overseas districts noticed at Wyszynski Audi Street, whose owner was suspected of stealing.
A 50-year-old was just behind the wheel.
A man was arrested in a police custody.
On Thursday, he heard the charges of theft of four gas stations and a bicycle.
He confessed to committing these crimes.
The uniforms also found the stolen bike.
The unity will soon return to the owner.
For stealing a thief, there's a penalty for imprisonment until five years.
Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, the administrator of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles at the meeting of the Senate Subcommittee on National Security on the FEMA Budgetary Proposal for the financial year 2020 at the Kapitolin Hill in Washington, USA on 3 April 2019.
YOURNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday, American President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, the deputy administrator of FEMA, is the head of the agency, who oversees a government response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The Agency acted without administrator approved by the American Senate since March when Brock Long released this position.
Long resigned after the United States Department of National Security, to which FEMA is subject, stated that Long used government vehicles in the wrong way between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this post, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month, when a thorough examination of his past revealed the charges that he was involved in a bar fight.
Gaynor's nomination for this job was expected.
To approve his nomination for this role, a majority in the Senate will be required.
The White House announced that before he became FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the Marine Walk.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considers amputation of the finger
The 28-year-old runner specialized at a distance of 1500 meters, winning the 2012 European Gold Medal (Elsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also Vice-President of Europe at 5000 meters from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not a new ailment and that he had already undergone one operation just after the 2016 games, but the pain had returned and had increased considerably in this season.
The pain makes me turn my foot, which in turn changes my body system, other unnatural loads occur, and I start to feel pain in other places, for example in the weather.
For this reason, I could not prepare myself enough for the world championships, and for two weeks the pain has been so strong that I have been having difficulty setting earrings – said the runner on the NRK TV channel.
The father and coach Gjert Ingebrigsen admitted that after long discussions with his son, he concluded that the only solution to not finish his career and participate in the next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo would be amputation.
It seems to be the only solution, although drastic, and the decision has actually come to an end.
“If a part of the body hurts, you should get rid of it, and Henrik does not need it so much, and in this situation you should forget the cosmetic aspect,” he explained.

EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday, police closed an illegal e-papero factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
The office building standing on 9600 Telstar Avenue about 16:37 was raided, during which police were looking for illegals intended for sale of e-paperos containing marijuana and during which large jars containing butane hash oil were found – concentrate from Indian cannabis.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police Department, officers also found a device that was used to supplement the calcium cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous" says Cano.
Cano, who used to work on drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
"The ordinary electrostatic spark from our clothes can cause ignition of these vapours, causing not only fire, but due to concentration, even explosions" - he says.
“If we have many jars and the like in the room, after one explosion, there will be another, not only a fire, but an explosion that could wipe the whole complex off the surface.
A task force was called upon to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
The value of confiscated products and equipment is currently unknown.
Detectives say they received an anonymous clue that allowed them to get a search warrant, which led to illegal activity being detected.
Investigators are still trying to get information on who's behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible set up a business here because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and the officers want to make sure that illegal products have not gone to the street, taking into account recent articles on heating damage.
"People don't really know what products they buy," says Cano.
‘They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
It could be a threat to our community and children, so we always keep them from reaching for this kind of thing.
Aphtin out of the market.
GIF has decided on a drug for moulds
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate has informed that the drug has been withdrawn from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used to treat mold and yeast mucosa infections, Gram-positive infections.
It can also be used auxiliaryly to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product has been withdrawn due to non-compliant quality specifications, the smell of the product and the decrease of the active substance content.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galen Laboratory in Olsztyn.
On average, each month GIF issues several decisions to withdraw individual batches of products from the market.
Following the presentation of evidence for the safety of the product, a series of medicines which have been put on the market may be reintroduced in Poland.
In case of withdrawal, this cannot be done.
Banknot 19 zł – where to buy the collector's note about this denomination?
It has a denomination of 19 zloty and has an image of Ignacy Jan Paderewski.
At the beginning of October a new collector's banknote will be introduced – informed the National Bank of Poland.
It's another "Independence" banknote.
It is intended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Polish Securities Company.
As stated in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented at the Bank.
The date on the bank, 25 January 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the PWPW is established.
Also nominal value, 19 zł, refers to the year of creation of the Factory" - reads in the NBP Communication.
The watermark presents the image of the eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in the PWPW after regaining independence.
The new feature is the holographic strip located on the window in the ground.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignacy Jan Paderewski and next to the inscription "independent" was presented the stylized image of the order of the White Eagle.
This inscription, modeled from the manuscript of Józef Piłsudski, is a logo of the 100th anniversary of Poland's recovery of independence.
A security developed by the PWPW - Umbra4Note, a special form of angular effect, was provided in the Lorenzo branch, symbolizing brotherhood and victory.
On the opposite side of the banknote there is a picture of the building The factory against the background of the panorama of modern Warsaw.
The PWPW logo includes SPARK Live protection and opalising strap, also visible in UV light in the form of repeating "19" and "NBP" - describes NBP.
The banknote is to enter the circulation on 2 October up to 55,000 units.
One note will cost 80 gold.
All banknotes and coins issued by NBP, including those from special series, are a legal means of payment in Poland.
However, their nominal value significantly exceeds the one that can be achieved on the collector market.
The new owner bought it for 500,000 dollars, more than two million zlotys, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to the port of Easton where it was loaded to the shoulder.
That's where it went down the river 50 miles.
Jarosław Kaczyński votes for Małgorzata Gosiewska
President of PiS Jarosław Kaczyński in the upcoming elections will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska.
"Please do the same," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczyński and Małgorzata Gosiewska posed for the photo of the banner candidate PiS.
On Friday, Warsaw's "three" boasted in social media that it would gain Kaczynski's vote in parliamentary elections.
“Legal and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński supports Małgorzata Gosiewska”, we read on her Facebook profile.
The party chief pointed out that it is a sensitive, emotional person and always ready to help.
"I will give my vote to Małgorzata Gosiewska, and I ask for it," he appeals.
Gosiewska is running for Sejm from District 19 (Warsaw) and third place on the list.
Kaczyński is the only one there, and Mariusz Kamiński holds second place.
The book fair is coming.
Before we meet with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We're here to break the stereotypes.
The people of Podkarpacia are said not to read books.
We'll show it's different," said Marta Halftrak at the press conference.
And who will support this year’s reading in Rzeszow?
As we have heard, the sister Anastasia, who is the first chef of the Republic of Poland, will appear at the fair, as well as: Łukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrovska and Jakub Twiek.
This autumn, the Millennium Hall will host a major cultural event – on 22 and 23 November, the 3rd edition of the Book Fair, one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishing and accounting officers from all over Poland will be at the fair.
There will be 30 of them, including Agora, Mark, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their posts they will present their wide range of publishing offers and hundreds of new books that participants will be able to buy at attractive prices.
In addition, there will be exceptional meetings with writers during the two days of the fair.
This time, authors have been invited to write about important issues and are not afraid to make difficult topics, and are also winners of prestigious awards, and... they cook well.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At the moment, the exhibition was confirmed, among others, by Łukasz Orbitowski – the winner of the political passport, Janusz Leon Wiśniewski, the author of the best-seller "Samlotości on the Network", and the queen of the Polish crime scene: Katarzyna Bonda.
The star of this year's fair will be the sister Anastasia, author of a dozen books (including cooks), which sold in more than 4 million copies.
Exhibition of the missing dress of Elizabeth I at the Hampton Court
The silver threaded dress made of the most fine silk chest was embellished with embroidery depicting vegetation, animals and butterfly.
For Eleri Lynn, the curator of the History Royal Palaces exhibition, it meant only one thing.
The white fabric hanging on the wall of the tiny rural parish church that she was looking at could only be a missing part of Elizabeth I's dressing room.
Three years after Lynn came across an exhibition in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elżbieta's missing dress is due next month at the Hampton Court Palace, close to the same rooms where the Tudor dynasty queen could wear it more than 450 years ago.
A measure of the meaning of this discovery is that only one more element of the XVI century’s dress survived from the entire royal dress collection.
Although there is no clear evidence that Elizabeth has ever worn this dress, three years of research has strengthened experts in the belief that she had to be part of the royal wardrobe.
"Silbars", an amazingly expensive fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtual quality of embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterfly, fishermen and bears, indicates that the clothes belonged to the most prominent of people.
The dress, at a time when it was sewn, could have cost the equivalent of the Tudor estate.
"In addition, in the 1990s, at the end of Elizabeth's reign, she felt threatened by other women outside and would not tolerate rivals wearing such fine fabrics," said Lynn.
"As this is a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at the dress.
I really enjoyed seeing the dress, too, and they were practically convinced that we had a part of the royal wardrobe in front of us.
A long, re-life dress, cut to serve as an altar cloth in the dark church of St Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is a settlement from which Blanche Parry, the nearest Elizabeth the lady of the court, who served the queen throughout her long life and with whom the fabric was identified in local legends.
Although the dress was formed after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to the Parra family or the parish to the memory of Blanche before she died in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservation work, four hundred of which came on the softest hand sewn using specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric will go to the exhibition next to the exhibition on loaned time by the Hatfield House portrait "Rainbow Portrait", one of the most famous paintings of Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress.
“When working with historical fabrics, the craftsmanship of the people who did it really begins to respect,” says Libby Thompson, head of conservation work, the most of which took place in a converted greenhouse in the Hampton Court Palace – the only large enough place to accommodate some of the priceless palace gobelines.
“Watching the embroidery from the front and from the back, I began to feel great respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The exhibition “The Lost Dress of Elizabeth” will begin on 12 October at the Hampton Court Palace
Fitch confirmed the Polish rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed on Friday the long-term rating of Poland in foreign currency at the level of "A-" – it was presented in the Communication.
The rating perspective remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency points to strong macroeconomic foundations and a well-diversified economy which is supported by a sound economic policy and a strong banking sector," says the Ministry of Finance.
Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the top of the economic cycle and that between 2019 and 2021 the real growth rate of the National Product Brutto in Poland would be 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
The Agency predicts that the GDP deficit of the general government for 2020-2021 will remain below the 3 % threshold, respectively, of 2.3 % and 1.9 %.
“The ratio of government debt to GDP in 2019 will be 50,5 per cent, and will be lower in subsequent years (mean 48,3 per cent in 2020-2021)”, we read.
Rating of Poland
The autumn round of Polish rating reviews will be completed on 11 October by S&P and Moody's.
Polish rating in the evaluation of Fitch Agency remains the same as it was issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the Agency confirmed Poland's "A-" rating with a stable perspective.
Of the three biggest credit rating agencies, Poland's credit credibility is highest assessed by Moody's – "A2" level.
The Polish rating according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level lower than Moody's.
The perspectives of all assessments are stable.
What's a rating?
Credit rating agencies are created to help investors assess the scale of the risks of their investment activities.
Rating is granted to companies, banks and countries.
In the latter case, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing more than a credit assessment.
On its basis, it decides who and for how much money to borrow.
Sometimes such information also suggests to whom it is best not to give any credit at all, because there is a great risk that money will not be recovered.
The lower rating is associated with higher risk.
In turn, higher risk is high interest on credit.
Each assessment shall be justified and duly substantiated.
Ratings can be manipulated, but in this case agencies risk losing their reputation.
At the moment, more than 90 percent of the global credit rating market controls three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them applies its own evaluation system.
Confederacy Friday: First 1000 plus
"The Friday of the Confederacy", which is the main basis for the electoral programme, presented on Friday in Koszalin candidates for Sejm from District 40 applying for a mandate from the list of KW Confederation of Freedom and Independence.
Krzysztof Chmielewski, the leader of the Koszalin letter to Sejm, gave the password of the Confederate Fridays.
"First, the 1000 plus programme for Poland, secondly, the quick and fair courts, thirdly the cultural bon and educational bon, for the fourth time national security, is a healthy life," said Chmielewski.
He pointed out that "Police must finally start earning money", so the Confederate wants to end the income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with the tax-free amount will solve itself".
"The Poles need to be given a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for everyone", said the leader of the list about the assumptions of "the 1000+ programme for Poland".
Aleksandra Zadenck, starting from second place in the list, referring to the program's "healthy life" password, said that "food is getting worse" and that change should be made, "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", to act for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederation is also in favour of stopping the "stigmatization of hemp".
Zadencka declared its support to the Confederation for the “development of building using natural resources”.
She also advocated "voluntary vaccinations" on behalf of her group.
"The right to informed consent cannot be broken," she added.
Other candidates to the Sejm from the Koshalin district stressed that the Confederacy was "a deep reform of the judiciary", one of which should include the examination of the case by the judge "day after day".
They also argued that educational subsidies should go to schools without local authorities, that is to say, without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederacy is also for "a strong Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates for the Sejm stressed the need to increase the size of the army.
In their opinion, it is also necessary to have easier access to weapons.
On economic issues, they stressed the need for "constant access to energy".
"We can gasate coal, we have large geothermal energy deposits, we also need to consider going back to the idea of the nuclear power plant," said Piotr Karpiński on the election list.
The head of the Mexican cartel is behind a third of the drugs in the U.S.
Chicago – just after sunrise on the West Side in Chicago CBS News reported a morning drug chase.
Brian McKnight at the DEA in full light showed what was happening.
In Chicago, nearly 800 people died of drug overdose last year.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of drugs in Chicago came from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantes, known simply as El Mencho.
"He is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for the US federal executive bodies", said Matthew Donahue, the principal DEA agent in Mexico.
El Mencho's prize goes to $10 million.
He helped discover dozens of drug labs located in the jungle of El Mencho.
Belongs to El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generation, CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs reaching the United States by land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, the cartel smuggled into cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
There's a $10 million prize for El Mencho's head.
Ironically, about 30 years ago, he lived in California, where he was arrested for drug charges and finally deported to Mexico.
That's where he set up a violent cartel.
He's got a huge amount of weapons, a RPG, a 50-caliber weapon.
In principle, he owns his own SWAT teams", added Donahue.
El Mencho unpunishedly protects his empire by taking measures such as shooting down the Mexican army helicopter, killing six people or participating in public hanging this summer.
Last year, the brutality of the cartel led to thousands of murders.
According to the statistics of the Mexican government, there are approximately 94 murders each day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic they can't be handled without protective equipment.
In the cocaine package lab, it's marked as a smuggler.
For more than one third of them, traces lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children", said Donahue.
So when someone's child dies, Donahue says there's a "a big chance" that drugs come from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died of overdose last year.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed the President of France and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady, says the French prosecutor.
The defendant shall ensure that he has documents that compromise the presidential couple.
He demanded the head of state, among others, EUR 300 000 in the ready room.
A man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France as a police officer claims to have received "explosion" documents from a person employed in the Elisha Palace.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but that the disclosure of them in full could put Macron and the first lady of France at risk.
In exchange for their return, he demanded EUR 300 000 – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of the daughters of Brigitte Macron from his previous marriage.
According to the D.A.'s Office, the defendant refused to hand over the documents he mentioned to the police.
He announced that he would pass it on to the media – but it is not yet known whether these documents really existed.
They weren't found at the time of the review at that 27-year-old's apartment.
A man was subjected to psychiatric examination, but doctors did not find any serious disorders.
PS4 will be an old-sculpted game – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony throws more light on the soon-depositing game available exclusively on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony announced in a recent presentation by the State of Play that the Prime Minister of the Last of Us would be held in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new piece of breathtaking game in the chest from the upcoming action game.
Even more concrete was revealed in the days after the loud premiere of The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching for the old-sculpted climates in a lot of ways.
We decided to do something we haven't seen too often since PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.
Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in a sensational interview given by The Telegraph, explaining that the sequal has grown into one of the most extensive games in history.
"The story is ambitious and involved in aspects where the one was not" - he said.
She had to be so extensive that she could present this kind of story with so many characters.
We weren't going to make the most of the game, that's just how it happened.
"We are excited to know how many possibilities are in this history. There will be moments when you think that you are going to the end, but you will realize that this is just the beginning and that a whole new chapter is beginning," Drukmann continues.
It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit on one BluRay and it's on two tiles.
In another place it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two easy eggi about adult content (information given by Gamespot).
We will not spoil the surprises, but the eggi appearing in the game refers to Naughty Dog's old-sculpted works.
You will find out more when The Last of Us: The Part Two will debut on February 21, 2020 only on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the premiere of the sequal, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available in the PS Plus offer.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, among which is the above mentioned production of Naughty Dog.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to MLB The Show 19 from October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to place an order for a sequential, Sony said that there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of Ella's backpack and her bracelet and a 30-inch figure of this cult character.
Run, scramble and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil's first high school will take Podbeskida, and he wants to win.
Stomila's footballers have been invincible for three rounds.
The caretakers of Piotr Zajizkowski won seven points at that time because they won with Stala Mielec and Chojnice Chojnice, and in the last match a no-bramous draw in Suwałki fell.
Now the Olsztyn team will take the Podbeskid on Saturday at 18 p.m., which is listed as one of the favorites for promotion to Extraklas.
The nearest Stomile rivals take fourth place in the table and have the advantage of the Olsztyn team.
Podbeskid on trips this season played six times and included two victories, drawouts and defeats while Stomil is very comfortable at his place – at the stadium near Piłsudski's 69th team Piotr Zajądzkowski won three times and once lost.
In total, in ten lines the alsztination gathered 17 points and are in the top of the table, although after two failures at the start of the game, nothing of this was announced.
“Every change takes time to produce results,” explains Piotr Skiba.
"And finally, something got in our hands, we believed in each other, and we can work under normal conditions.
We were just focusing on playing ball.
They're clean heads, there's a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do, because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomil's footballers eliminated the Chorzów Movement from the Polish Cup, but they needed to win and a series of criminal throws.
Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go to the south of Poland, because Coach Zajezkowski gave them key players a break before Saturday's fight with Podbeskidziem.
On the other hand, in Chorzow, Jakub Mosakowski played a returning player after the injury, who finally shot his long-awaited goal.
“It’s always fun to get a goal, and I’ve got it at such a time that we can continue to play the cups (Mosakowski levelled at 3:3 in 119 min. - red.).
My dad used to bite me a lot and laugh at me that I couldn't get the goal, and I always told him I'd shoot him at a time like this when he wasn't expecting."
Now Mosakowski is counting on returning to the basic composition, especially because of the yellow cards he cannot play Oleh Tarasenko.
“This is what I put hard on training to be able to play first composition,” says Mosakowski.
“In Chorzow I did my best to present myself.
However, whether I'm playing or sitting on a reserve bench, I'm going to support the team as strongly as I can.
Because the most important thing is a team and three points in a match with Podbeskidzie.
We will certainly have a hard meeting in which the victory will have to be run out, scraped and fought."
In the middle of the Olsztyn defense, Rafał Remisz can still play, who has recently also suffered an injury, so whether he or she will not know until Saturday, especially since Coach Zącizkowski has traditionally tried to keep his personnel secret until the end of the case.
A man raped and murdered a niece
“You will never see the light of day.
You will never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, addressing Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and mean that you had to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
A five-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Its search lasted five days until Whipple indicated the place to hide the body.
"How could anyone do this to his own niece?", he asked Demay Smith, the girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person mankind has to offer," he said to Alex Whipple.
"I would give anything to meet her again, hug her," said the mother of the murdered girl.
"Our life will never be the same again," added a devastated woman.
According to Fox News, 22-year-old Whipple showed no emotion during the interrogation.
Last month, he admitted he kidnapped, sexually abused, and murdered a girl.
A man's lawyer said that his client grew up in a "improvement family".
He was supposed to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple was aware that he had committed a terrible act and was willing to suffer punishment.
A man was sentenced to life without the possibility of applying for parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced that he will hand over nearly $100 million of additional funds to the affected drought communities.
The programme to provide money to farmers affected by droughts will be extended and the criteria for the allocation of additives on farms will be simplified.
The package of aid includes almost $34 million to support the affected communities, so that eligible farms can receive up to $3,000 in emergency situations.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the programme will receive up to $1 million of infrastructure grants and help manage the consequences of the disaster.
The new support package is an addition to more than 7 billion dollars spent by the government to the fund for the fight against drought.

In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters
documentary: In China, the divorce rate has doubled in the last decade.
Third parties were generally the cause of this situation.
More and more men maintain their relationship outside marriage, which has led to the development of a particular industry in this country – professional lovers' slayers, who have the task of saving marriages of betrayed wives.
Let's scan loudly: Ma-te-ouch!
An attempt to welcome the Prime Minister in Silesian Bakery
A private general test was conducted before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Pekkary Śląski.
"Dear ladies and gentlemen, louder and louder, we will not welcome your Prime Minister here!
Let us scan loudly, Ma-te-Ear!", encouraged the leading.
Unfortunately, the enthusiast leader’s efforts have not produced the expected result.
The election campaign is ongoing.
Politicians drive all over the country, persuading voters to themselves.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who is the leader of the Silesian list of PiS, is a frequent guest in the region.
Each meeting is well planned, including the appropriate frame.
It was also supposed to be in Silesian Bakery.
The special guest should be especially welcomed.
Before meeting the Prime Minister, the executive decided to conduct a general trial.
Like a barren leader, he tried to encourage the crowd to run the name of the head of government.
"This will not be a greeting to me, but to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
He also louder, louder, my dears!", encouraged the disenthusiasted.
Unfortunately, the crowd could not be completely kidnapped by the heat of the leading and reluctantly responding “Ma-te-ouch”, but the recording of an enthusiastic leader makes a furry on the web.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of murdering his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the murder of Stephen and Katie Stay in 2014, and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the Stay house on 9 July 2014, demanding that his wife, Melanie Haskell, be present with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but her sister was Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7 died when Haskell opened fire, as Harris' Sheriff's Office says.
There was only one family member, 15 years old then Cassidy Stay.
The authorities said she was badly injured, but she managed to recover completely.
On Thursday, members of the jury rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of illegitimateness.
The jury will meet again on Monday to pass sentence.
Quantum Internet Getting Closer to Reality – ScienceDaily
The results of the U.S. Army research are moving the quantum Internet one step closer.
Such an Internet could offer military capabilities in terms of security, detection and accuracy of time retention not available at traditional network creation approaches.
The Centre for the Dispersed Quantum Processing of Military Information Laboratory for the Development of the U.S. Army's Power Management was looking at researchers from the University of Insbruck, who managed to achieve a record transfer of the state of confusion between matter and light – within 50 kilometres of using fibre cables.
Confusion is a correlation that can arise between quantum such as cubs.
When two cubs are confused and measured one of them, this will affect the measurement made on the other, even if the second cub is physically remote.
"These [50 kilometers] are two rows of size further than previously possible and this is a feasible distance to starting the construction of intercity quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist from Innsbruck University and the chief researcher in the project, whose discoveries were published in Nature magazine, the Quantum Information section.
Intercity quantum networks would consist of distant nodes of physical cubs, which are intertwined with each other despite large physical distances.
The researchers found that this dispersion of the entangled state is necessary for the creation of a quantum Internet.
"This demonstration is a big step forward to achieve a large-scale dissipated state of affairs," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-management of a military program supporting these research.
The quality of the entangled state at the other end is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult uses of quantum networks.
The research team began an experiment with calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.
With laser beams, researchers have entered the quantum state in ion, simultaneously stimulating it to display the photon in which the quantum information was stored.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the particles of light were entangled.
The challenge is to send the photon with a fiber optic cable.
"The photo emitted by ion calcium has a wave length of 854 nanometers and is rapidly absorbed by the fibre" - said Lanyon.
That's why his team originally sent a piece of light through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser ray.
The length of the photon wave has been converted into an optimal value for long distance transmission – the current standard telecommunications wavelength is 1550 nanometers.
The researchers then sent this photon through a 50-mile fibre cable.
Their measurements show that the atom and the particles of light were still confused even after the wavelength has been converted and that the distance has passed.
“The decision to choose calcium means that this result is a direct route to create a entangled network of nuclear clocks at large physical distances, as calcium can be co-incarcerated with a high-quality "timer".
The army is very much interested in large-scale confused clock networks, due to applications for precise positioning, precise navigation and time synchronisation," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-manages the program.
