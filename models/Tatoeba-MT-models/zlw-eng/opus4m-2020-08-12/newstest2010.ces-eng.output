Barack Obama will be awarded the fourth American President of the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth American president in history.
Diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million will be awarded for, among other things, exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with Michelle's wife, and he'll be busy.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time five members of the committee who selected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The President's couple then have an appointment with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in the ceremony that Obama will receive the prestigious award for.
He'll win it as the fourth American president, but only the third one to win the prize directly at the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan War when accepting the awards.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that the prize is being taken over as the president who is currently at war in two countries.
The war effort a few days ago increased the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to stress any of its critics.
At the Obama ceremony he will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for 10 million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
They're going to put on charity, but they haven't decided on a particular charity yet.
The charged program of the president with his wife will then introduce him to a banquet where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests will also be present.
Obama was more relentless from the beginning to the price.
For example, he stated that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it was not only for him, but for all those who seek the same values as him.
Right after the announcement, he said he was "a call for action".
Protector of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřicky police accused the President of the Civil Society of Nature Protectors Litoměřice of extortion.
In a few cases, in the past year, he referred to some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of the appeals he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said the Lithuanian police spokesperson Alena Roma.
Lubomír Studnička is the chairman of the Litoměřice Nature Protector Society.
He's in custody now, and he's facing three years of prison.
The sorting containers of Brno don't smell much.
In Prague, ordinary people can sort their packaging with drinks, in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There, to reserve a few minutes before you find the right trash cans.
I don't want to say that there's nothing wrong with the waste in Brno.
But it seems to me that we are the second largest city in the Republic, councillors are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in a forest waste sorting league not only by throwing paper, glass and plastics into sorting containers as citizens, but mainly by the number of garbage cans.
Have you ever tried downtown, for example, to throw a PET bottle into a collecting basket?
It's a good time, especially when it takes time and nerve.
The only place I've found so far is on the Moravian Square opposite Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think it's too much.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste sorting.
A lot of my friends don't like trash that much.
Laziness.
It's a long way to the trash cans.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered to throw away some glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored trash cans on Kounica Street.
Fortunately, I ran into the right place on the way to the shalina.
But the wastes overflowed.
It's still the center of Brno that represents the city the most, isn't it?!
But ecology and some aesthetics probably don't care about Brno socialists.
They'd rather buy the city a hockey extra league that would embarrass us all over the country than buy a few extra containers and offer to classify other ingredients for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could confirm my assumption after a while of browsing on the Internet with official statistics.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian region.
"Paroubk's" budget took money for pensions and sickness
After adding the left to the government’s opinion to farmers or officials, the budget may not include money for pensions, sickness, or construction savings.
But also interest on government debt or international lawsuits.
It will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and Communists promoted some groups, they relied on sensitive spending, pensions or illness to borrow the government. "It's just a delay in the future, putting mines," Janota says.
In fact, borrowings are paying increasing interest rates and sometimes they have to return.
The state doesn't have much choice where to take it.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the State, they must raise taxes.
To all the left-handers she's added: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children.
People don't have to worry about pensions or sickness, whose account is 1.8 billion.
However, at the price of the state indebtedness – next year it will not be only 163 billion in the cash register, but more.
Despite the efforts made by Minister Janota, the debt will grow more and more rapidly and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay it and will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce motherhood, as the government did in its antideficit package.
Due to the money transfers for the benefit of several groups of voters, five billion motorways and railways will also be missing next year.
These are mainly already competitive and developed sections which are not redesignable and, where appropriate, affordable.
Mostly preserve, which is not free either.
It means delaying or stopping 30 large buildings, the use of European money is also at risk, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The ČSSD proposed that the loss of money will be solved in Solomonian – it reaches into ČEZ dividends, which the state most of its own, and of them will deposit the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never certain, and it's not even a bottomless source.
Last year, ČEZ entered the budget of 18 billion.
Each year, dividends are paid for the disposal of ecological damage, supplementing the pension account or serving as a reserve for pension reform.
Moreover, this trick in accordance with EU rules increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, this does not end the carnival of transfers.
Almost three billion were left in the budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crime, or expenditure on judicial disputes, even building savings.
If it goes without this money, it's not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, we'll have to pay anyway, says Janot.
The Minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
A hundred million is also missing for the two-billion-dollar Treasury project already under way, which is intended to allow them to monitor on-line what individual authorities are spending on.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance hadn't found the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, the sanctions would come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
Americans are counting on a mobile phone to switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
Revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will move to Android in seconds.
This is precisely what the American company VMware aims at, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We'll let you run two user profiles at once on your phone.
You can switch between them, you can split them into home and work.
They will both work at one and the same time, suggested Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented last November and was presented a few days ago for the first time.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, which also ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems alongside each other.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware cooperates with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and customers should be able to access the equipment during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains troubles hotels
The naked downhills don't concern only the Giant Mountains.
The missing snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
For this reason, in the Giant Mountains it is still possible to find available rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors to our website.
People go through offers, find prices, but so far they're afraid to order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask whether this year's Christmas will be on the snow or on the mud," said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Anyone who wants to stay in Špindlerův Mlýn exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Whoever prefers saving money and the quality of accommodation is in his second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Špindlerov hotels are offering for weeks on New Year's Eve.
I think they're going to try to turn them in for a while, but then they're going to let go and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will decline quickly," said Jandura.
The Ingtours travel agency still offers free beds in all winter periods.
Now we're most interested in a Christmas week that hasn't been sold out yet.
Still half the seats in our offer remain available.
That is why we have already made some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said the director of Ingtoursu Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still offer a travel agency in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer places available.
The first 14 days of February go well for sale, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to attack.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If snow is snowed during the week, Christmas will be sold out," means Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is better than last year to fill the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're about five percent better off.
We have the last few seats for New Year's Eve.
A great deal of interest is about Polish holidays in January, and it is also well sold February," Karel Rada informed the director of the best bakery hotel.
The hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne has a new stay of 80 percent.
On the contrary, half of the available beds remain in the newest hotel in the city for Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, which we already have occupied about 60 percent.
A little weaker is February so far, but once the snow comes, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said the director of the hotel Omnia Erik Sporysch.
However, for a larger part of the snow, the Giant Mountains hotels need to have a taste.
It's supposed to cool down on Thursday, if there's any rainfall, there should be snow on the mountains.
But then there is to be warming again, informed Jiří Jakubský from the castle workplace of the Czech Hydrometorology Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is quite funny, with what school effort Barack Obama, the president with the greatest reputation, repeats his predecessor's strategy in Afghanistan, which he thought was the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his longingly expected Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he described it through a copycat from the Bush Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only has he used the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text himself, but he did not hesitate to use the name Bush's declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward".
He himself criticized Bush's idea three years ago to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq plagued by civil war as "responsible and catastrophic decisions in his wake".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on the recommendations of the field commanders was the only possible and successful enough to not speak of Iraq at all in the news reports today.
It did not improve Bush's reputation, but objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
He was asked again by the field commanders, in particular the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite subordination practices, harshly criticized the valiant shooters in the White House.
He asked for 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't think of anything better, so at least he cheated on the general by 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to deliver another 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally counted on at least 10.
The most problematic of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process within three years. Obama's entire doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt half the increase will give the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the murderous wars of recent years, Iraqi society has been relatively well organized, its leaders honoring the agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite sign - no one can be relied on and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are badly prepared to change their master every day, depending on their suitability.
The political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a potemkin village for which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue.
The balance between the interests of the different ethnic groups is extremely complex given the lack of transparency of the conditions that further complicate Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the construction of an "accessful state", which is the minimalist objective of the entire operation, does not seem to be too real.
Obama's strategy is staggering with its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sending to war in order to "bring home" will cause the miracle done here, only the soul can truly romantic, intact reality.
Politically, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is a clear irresponsibility, since the Taliban will see it as an indirect confession of America's defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to take part in combat operations in Afghanistan is going to a negative.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their voters how the safety of Germany or Italy is linked to the war on the Indian foothills.
Another factor capable of radically affecting the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran do not affect the situation, the question will arise in front of the United States whether not to attempt to solve the problem by military force.
It will be necessary to answer her at a time when Obama believes America will proceed to the victory withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left before the presidential election, and therefore enough time to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers no longer get cash prizes
The senior leaders of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not be rewarded in cash this year.
It was announced by a company that reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will get shares instead of money that can be sold first in five years.
In addition, shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs thus puts Reuters at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to go, said former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Banka Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after putting nearly $17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) aside in the first three quarters of this year.
This year, according to Reuters, the overall level of remuneration in the company is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the announced measure.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political topic in many countries with the arrival of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that it intends to charge 50 percent of the taxes to bankers in excess of £25,000 (approximately CZK 712.000).
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
The record five women in Stockholm today took over from the hands of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustaf this year’s Nobel prize in professional categories and literature.
In addition to four scientists, there was also a German writer Herta Müller from Romanian origin.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded by two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Shostak, for research on chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was given by Israeli Ada Jonath, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, to clarify the structure and functions of the ribosomas.
The last laureate was Nobel's Nobel Prize for Economics, which was won by American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson for an analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
Today, Charles Kao's scientists took this award for optical fibre research and George Smith and Willard Boyl for the invention of a CCD chip that is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each award received a diploma, a Nobel medal, and a financial reward certificate.
For each category it amounts to 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million CZK).
If there are more of them, they share their rewards.
Traditionally the most awaited Nobel Peace Prize has been won by the President Barack Obama of Norway this afternoon.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversialness of his appreciation, because he is only at the beginning of his path, and he is also at the forefront of a country leading two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defence of his politics, however, he added that wars are, in certain situations, essential for the fight of peace, even if the price for this is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to Castle
President Václav Klaus will accept on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who is considering persisting in the government, because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps even Janot’s continued office will be the themes of their Friday meetings.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, he has too high a deficit, which further exacerbates the crisis of public finances.
The president's spokesperson, Radim Chvat, informed us about the meeting.
Janota wants to discuss her further post on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus is now getting signed, the Czech Republic should manage the deficit of CZK 163 billion.
On Wednesday, however, the House agreed to the left's proposals for money transfers and increased the money to the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has blamed the proposals for social democracy for secretly increasing the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, on the other hand, there was a sharp internal political dispute, which started to raise questions about the next operation of Fischer's official cabinet, on which the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party agreed to form in the spring.
The critics argue that the budget, as the House has adopted it, is essentially eliminating the package of austerity measures that Fischer's government has put forward in the autumn to stop the debt of the state.
Klaus, which the state budget law can, but also does not have to sign, stated for today's discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have been neglecting the "serious problem" of "unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
He doesn't think he has a good solution anymore.
Only a strong government, which, moreover, could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, could bring improvements, means the President.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget is scary and that the government should consider further existence.
The Vice-President of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and greens clearly no longer works.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as "strength statements".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánka by saying that the deficit of the budget, which the former Topolán government prepared for this year, would exceed CZK 200 billion.
On Wednesday, ČSSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
People were also satisfied.
Mandela played Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's news
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated will tell the world much about the country, about its fights and victories despite some criticisms, that American actors play the leading roles.
The story is about sport, racial conditions, and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandel, in his life story, represents the Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 79-year-old Mandela asked him to make it in Eastwood's film.
Another important part of it is Matt Damon.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have access to you.
Twenty-seven-year-old actor who won the Eastwood drama prize from the boxing environment of the Million Dollar Baby, for example, has made the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became a slave, a fictional president of the United States and even a god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
A former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active work for ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released for freedom in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is the Latin word for the undefeated and it is the name of the poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The picture is a true story about Nelson Mandela joining forces with the captain of South Africa’s Rugby team Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation is still racially and economically divided after the apartheid.
They believe that they can join their people through sport, so they decide to unite the rugby players who belong on a worldwide scale to the outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman's been working for years to get Mandel's story on the screen.
I had no goal but to play this role to bring it as close as possible to reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out that when I was printing your hand, I was taking over your energy, it was being transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you were feeling, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
At the end of the day, he was surprised when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened to me, and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of actors compared to their true roles under the direction of Director Eastwood, Invictus won: Undefeated positive reviews and are also talking about the ambitions of Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summed up his ratings in words: "He was a very good story, a very well made film."
In the film reviews on the rotentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway is deciphered: the Russians tested the missile
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence admitted yesterday that near the Norwegian border it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The start was once again unsuccessful and the missile called "Bulava", which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, slowly becomes the black moth of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the rocket tests had no proper effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava didn't usually take off at all, or it was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is already referred to as "a broadcast that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but light up
This was already the 13th attempt at the beginning normal.
Until the end of the flight, technical damage to the apparatus occurred again.
Apparently, the engine exploded at the third degree of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" took off from Dmitry Donskiy's atomic submarine, which sailed under the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows firing from a vessel that is in motion at the same time immersed.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was indeed a broken "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians never doubted it was a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time and claim that failure cannot be unequivocally discussed.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines were broken in the first degree.
Although not a single test start has taken place without a mistake, only six out of thirteen are considered unsuccessful by the Ministry of Defence.
Therefore, almost 50% of the success of the generals is optimistic and still claims that "Bulava" will fly without any problems once and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow at 51 years old
Legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will again present himself in a professional hockey game at 51 years old.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and holder of the Stanley Cup will help in the need of their CSKA Moscow team and will probably start in the Friday duel of the KHL against St Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denise Kuljaš got hurt, we need another defenseman.
Fetisov regularly trains and agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formal elements, quote the AP coach of the Moscow club Sergei Němčinova.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only apply to one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirit of other players, said Němčinov.
According to AP, Fetisov will become the oldest professional hockey player in Russia if he returns to the ice.
At the NHL he played in his fifty-one years of the whole season for Hartford the legendary attacker Gordie Howe and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Laryonov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the uniform of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven world champions, triumphed at the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career, he also collected achievements in the NHL, where he doubled over Stanley Cup in Detroit.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the hall of fame hockey.
Hyundai has accepted the union, canceling all overtime.
The management of the line car company Hyundai agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the often ordered overtime that the union declared an emergency strike on Monday.
It was confirmed by the spokesperson of the car manufacturer Hyundai Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to make a deal with the trade union on one more Saturday.
We cannot resign on our production plan, it is essential, therefore it was proposed a voluntary overtime on Saturday 19 December, with two shifts being made, said Vanek.
Server Seven.cz wrote that the company of employees who work on the Saturday shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
This will be given to people back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the way employees were motivated over time.
Either they get paid overtime or they can choose a spare leave on December 28, and thus extend Christmas holidays by a day, said Vaněk.
In addition, all staff on Saturday's shift will receive paid fares and lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in terms of the comments and complaints made by the trade unionists, as well as protesting workers, which stopped production economically last week, the management decided with immediate effect yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtimes per month of December, Vaněk said.
By the end of last week, car workers were forced to work more than two hours overtime every day after an eight - hour shift.
After the agreement has been signed, the union will withdraw the strike alert
Another meeting between the management of the car and the trade union is scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The head of the union, Petr Kuchař, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation in the car company grew sharp last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously struck due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management opposed that overtime had to be performed by employees in order to meet the requirements for the supply of cars.
In their Monday strike call, experts also called for no sanctions to be imposed on workers who discontinued production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions demand that the company reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a prize of CZK 5000 for it this year.
The carrier Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production started last November.
By this September, it produced approximately 80,000 cars, with its current production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on ‘absorbed’ HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new compounds that can slow down the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity against medicines.
This fact, in some cases, outweighs the fact that the compound does not act as strongly as some of the medicines already available.
AIDS disease cannot yet be cured.
However, the combination of medicines that prevent the proliferation of HIV in the body may significantly prolong the life of patients.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of the virus results in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which drugs are already ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the University of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus resistance.
They have shown that substances called meta-carborans have an effect on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
Metal-carborates are boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt compounds.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the medicines used today, and can therefore overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by an atom of metal, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV fission, there would be no mature infectious viral particles.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, and scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically altered.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effects of this series of HIV protease substances have been tested in the test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on the normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of the clinically used medicines, but does not lose its effect for the resistant variants against which medicines are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications made metacarboranes interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, Head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The argument over the budget, the ODS went to Fischer, he defends himself.
ODS Chief Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year "terrible" and, according to him, Prime Minister Fischer's government should consider further existence.
Mr ODS called the Prime Minister a strong statement.
He's keeping time for analysis.
Vice-President Petr Nečas said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the House to fight a growing deficit or to remain in office with the help of a parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, pointed out Nečas.
On Wednesday, the House adopted a budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments for more than CZK 12 billion.
The House increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the operation of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government's statement to the social democracy proposals was that it secretly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage the deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, so it complied with the government's wishes that even the amended budget is a less bad option than a budget commission.
Disappointment and Prosperity
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke about disappointment and vanity, and Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign from office in the event of amendments being adopted, the situation could have looked different.
According to Czech Television Janota ordered for the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was considering further continuing in function.
The reason is his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks for the next fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government, there is nothing to do with the nominees of the ČSSD, which have made changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves other legislation on increasing deficits, such as those relating to sickness, pensions or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not guilty
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated by ODS did nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in the US text message.
He recalled that there were people in several ministries who had voted against the budget for TOP 09 in deputy positions.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give up the principle of combating the higher government deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct that he will rely on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House".
Then he says he can't count on the support and tolerance of civil democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and when it's up to me, I'm going to deal with it, the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, who was nominated for the government by citizens' democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer left for the European Council meeting in Brussels this afternoon.
At the request of the ODS Prime Minister,
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the revised budget on Wednesday in the House if the Prime Minister of Civil Democrats did not explicitly ask for the adoption of the budget to be made possible.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, and he responded to the question of whether ODS did not burden the presence of the President of the Parliament and the Czech Republic in the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
As soon as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly the Bolshevikization of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new order of ČD, fewer trains will ride for almost the same fare
The Czech Railways will cancel or limit some less burdened speeds and localities from December 13th, while the other connections will increase.
The total volume of transport shall be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, the residents of Ostrava will gain more possibilities of connecting to the capital, and the tracks will add one set of pendolinos to this track.
On the contrary, the speed train will stop going to Bratislava.
Less speed bumps will also go on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct connection Prague - Letohrad will be substantially restricted.
The regions are planning the biggest reduction of transport in the Královéhradecký Region, a total of eight percent; on the contrary, Prague and its surroundings can look forward to the increase.
There are also two night trains moving on the route Praha - Tábor - České Budějovice and the operation of several speed bumps on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to some days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, and today Milovičtí have to move in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko suburban system, which can be opened by completing the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Remote connections to the capital will end at the Prague Main Railway Station.
The ČD will introduce multiple SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jesenník will take two-hour intervals.
From 13 December, passengers will no longer take the pendoline to Bratislava.
This year's regional rail account: 200 million more
The speedsters are ordering and paying the Ministry of Transport, a total of CZK 4 billion will be paid to the expensive next year, as well as CZK 4 billion. The locations are ordering the regions, they will pay CZK 8 billion in total next year, and the state will contribute less than three billion to the regions.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have a newly concluded 10-year contract for locals and fasts, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The runways praise the system, which is why they do not seem to have reached an increase in the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will take place only for one-day network tickets ČD Net and cheap internet tickets eLiška.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will be increased from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLiška will now depend on the distance, so far it was uniform for the journey between any regional cities and it was 160 crowns.
Philippine armed men still holding over 50 people, children released
Today, armsmen in the south of the Philippines kidnapped 75 people, including several primary school pupils and their teachers.
It was provided by the AFP agency, which initially informed only 65 of the kidnappings.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
Kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 armed men say he's using hostages as a living shield to escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police originally chased the kidnapper because of the violence that required the settlement of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanoo, there was a recent massacre, where 57 people were killed, declared martial law.
There were 30 journalists among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the elections to the governor's office.
For suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Philly province was arrested and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential family of the Ampatuan.
There are also Muslim separatists active on Mindanao.
But they restored peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of the JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (official title in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of the former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of world-renowned fighter against apartheid was acquired by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose for his performance years ago.
The male side role of the legendary South African champion in the rugby Francoise Pienaar was played by Matt Damon.
Putting the film in the cinemas, both critics and the public are rising from the voice of the critics.
Nelson Mandela
The whole name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in South Africa Mvez.
In 1988 Sakharov received the prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 together with de Klerk Nobel's Peace Prize.
The President of South Africa was from 1994 to 1999.
great expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup in South Africa are at the same time peaking, but at the same time, the media is shaking with worrying reports about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the new film in the JAR has been positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the main roles of the "freaky" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the new movie, according to his words.
I've been dreaming about the role for years, and I've been preparing for it well.
I've also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to use his energy - as I'm told - in an interview after the film premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we can remind the film of Mandel's personality and message.
It is the story of the South African Republic, but it concerns every human being, he added.
In the uniform of the national rugby team
A picture based on the book by British writer John Carlin, with a freely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation, portraits South African human rights advocates during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman thus tries to stun two race groups during the film and, for many years, the mutually defined groups of the population and, like in 1995, Nelson Mandela, he also plays an actor role in the South African national rugby uniform on the World Cup field, which the JAR won at that time.
Mandela harvested a large ovation mostly of the white audience 14 years ago, and gained recognition of the white population, for entering the lawn in his uniform, which is almost sacred in the JAR.
The football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, as the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" player on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in the JARs improves, it will only show up.
But the white South Africans are skeptical of how a rugbyist Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, gave an example in a recent interview for LN.
The Championship will start on 11 June 2010.
There's a transformer burning in Lounland for tens of millions of crowns.
Fire was captured in the morning by transformer of Čeps in the switchboard near Vysokov in Lounsko.
According to the spokesman at the fire, Lukáš Marvan has six units in the region fire.
Originally, firemen wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later they re-evaluated the view and fire with a mixture of water, foam and special fire extinguishers.
The cause was a technical failure, an internal transformer short circuit.
No one has been injured, according to the spokesman of Pavel Mandátová, there is no threat to the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, calculated exactly after the fire has ended.
The destroyed transformer will need to replace the Mandate with a new one.
In ten years, nothing like this happened to Čeps, the defects of this type are unique, it added.
According to CEZ spokesperson for northern Bohemia, Soni Holinger Hendrych's deliveries were not interrupted, the functioning of households, offices and companies did not affect the trafostation fire.
A.s. Čeps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the transmission system, electrical cables 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution lines with 67 transformers converting electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and a route of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura submits a criminal complaint for slander to three chiefs from the ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will today submit a criminal complaint for slander on three socio-democratic chiefs.
On Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubicky Region and the captain of the Olomouc Region of Martin Tesařík.
Jančura said it in 20 minutes.
The action is related to the efforts of the company to operate regional train transport in certain regions.
All regions, however, finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Ways.
All three of the captains are attacking us, and they're talking about the fact that we're picking herbs, and we've brought only what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the Czech Railways prices that were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for slander against the Student Agency, said Radiożurnalu Jančura.
He also stated that he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken action in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the submission of a criminal complaint to be a further continuation of the media show by Mr. Jančura, which serves as an unpaid advertisement by his company and his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend the good name of my country and of my country, and I will call on the other captains to do the same.
I assume that it will also be clear on this occasion that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, hashek said.
Jančura has already announced last week that he is investing a few million crowns in advertising, which will alert the disadvantaged step of the regions.
Radiojournal said that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and continue to do so after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Railways and on order about 150 billion crowns did not enter the tender.
According to Jančura, similar conduct is illegal and contrary to the view of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train transport in the regions Jančur was already threatened by a Member for the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know which gentleman he is, I will not say his name, said Radiožurnalu Jančura today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
The pneumococcal vaccination will bring down the practices of January.
It's supposed to be the first for families free and optional.
However, voices are already saying that the compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for introducing free pneumococcal vaccination are peaking.
The pharmaceutical institute already sets the maximum price for vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are also clear in the vaccination procedure.
New vaccinations
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born on 2 August and later may be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal pneumococces.
The condition is they haven't received a single vaccination dose yet.
Anyone who started the vaccination last year or before must pay for another revaccination.
The first vaccination dose must be given between 3 and 5 months of age of the child.
Last year, she voluntarily had her children vaccinated against a quarter of her families.
At the same time, parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose and more.
Four doses are needed when the youngest children are vaccinated.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will spend between CZK 300 and CZK 450 000 per year on vaccination benefits.
But they will save up for the treatment that children without vaccination would need.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 a year for all the vaccinations of children.
The fenced vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janote Package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including encephalitis and blood poisoning.
The pneumococcal infection in our country will die in a year, according to an investigation in hospitals of up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced fenced vaccinations of children against pneumococci in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are views that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, it is to be covered by insurance and optional.
For example, the head of the civil association Naloud Rudolf Kalovský indicated that the compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association of pneumococcal vaccines has long been promoting.
Experts at the international conference that took part in our association were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed to enforce at least this.
I think that's the way we need to get on now, said Kalovský.
But the health department doesn't want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this point, we are not considering it at all, said his spokesperson, Vlastimil Sršeň.
Vaccination on a voluntary basis has its disadvantages, says doctors
The Chairman of the Professional Society of Practical Children’s Doctors, Hana Cabrnoch, acknowledges that he has a voluntary vaccination disadvantage.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of revaccinations could be considered "For a situation where this vaccine is worth such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was launched as a voluntary one," says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect their infants to vaccinate against pneumococci from next year more than 80 percent of their fresh parents.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough in the fact that it is the first flat vaccination of children by health insurance companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving for further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy substances themselves
However, this is related to the concerns of practical paediatric doctors regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to their original intention, vaccines were to be bought by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccines.
Some Members were concerned, however, that insurance companies could "get out of health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for insurance companies to pay them off.
According to estimates, the individual children’s practitioners will invest 40,000 a month in the vaccine, which is a significant sum.
It's not going to be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
Son of an American artist 'stealing at a museum'
The son of a renowned American fantasist, Frank Frazatta, was accused of attempted robbery of paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The police in Pennsylvania said that Alfonso Frank Frazatta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr Frazatta and the other man used to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains Bagr.
Mr Frazatta senior, 81 years old, was famous for the creation of the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
The artist was located in Florida at the time of the event, as reported by the Associated Press press agency.
AP quoted an unappointed police officer who stated that Mr Frazatta's younger could have been motivated to act by long-standing family disputes.
Before the police, Mr Frazatta issued a younger sworn statement, 52 years old, that he had done so at the direction of his father, "to get to the museum in any way possible and to transfer the images to the malting space", as the agency stated.
Mr Frazatta, senior, denied the granting of any such authorisation as the Agency has stated.
Labourists resist the planned increase in taxes
Ministers advocated an increase in taxes and spending cuts reported in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, Tory's "forsaken" possibility to show that he is serious about delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the elections.
Even the Chancellor was under fire because of the disability of low- and medium-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0,5 % in social security and 1 % of the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Transparency with regard to social security
The committees protested that low-income workers had been punished for a recession they had not caused and had warned in advance of the "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of around £3 trillion a year - which upset the business community, who said it was a tax on employment, while it should focus on the recovery of the economy.
This increase, which is limited to more than £20000 per year, will affect around 10 million workers.
PBR KEY BODY
Social insurance will increase by a further 0,5 % from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected by 4.75 % this year
New taxation of 50 % of bankers' bonuses
Increase 1% of corporate depreciation tax for small companies
Tax reduction for electric cars and wind power plants
Increase in pension measurement by 2.5 %
According to the government's estimate, some £30,000 revenue will decrease by £90 a year and some £40,000 revenue will decrease by £190 while some £10,000 revenue will increase by £ 110.
Ministers announced that their deficit reduction target to halved by 2013 meant "complex decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall to 5% of those with the highest income.
Stephen Timms, the Finance Minister, denied that the proposed increase in taxes and the reduction in spending would be a 'kapka in the ocean' compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is an absolute basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said he was convinced that economic growth should take place at the turn of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In his opinion, he stated that the economic downturn was 4.75% this year - far worse than the fall by 3.5%, predicted in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Wasted opportunity'
Conservatives, who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning against the "crisis of indebtedness" of the Labour Group, called the planned loan of 789 trillion pounds in the next six years intolerable..
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan, as could be paid, to add, "cynically" delayed this decision until after the elections - which must take place until June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that could be done," Philip Hammond's shadow finance minister said. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All the important announcements will be made after the election if we win them"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, as opposed to Tory's proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats claim that the money obtained by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year rather than reducing deficits, and argue that the plans are "standing on sand".
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson mentioned the timing of the communication - for example, the above inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay benefits in next April - that this could lead to accusations against the Chancellor in the election campaign if the money was difficult to get back a year later.
But Labourists insist on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised on September 2010.
Suspect budget'
Although the ministers did not publish the expenditure details after 2011, economists stated that it is clear that the reduction in public expenditure would only be the beginning of medium-term restraints.
The recognised Institute of Budgetary Studies has reported that the Chancellor's figures suggest significant cuts in many areas, potentially in budocne include transport, higher education and defence.
"It is really very painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements come after the election, if we win them," added Roger Bootle, an economic advisor to Deloitte's account reviror.
"That was a report on a suspicious preliminary budget. The markets are implementing it."
The FBI is investigating in the 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating five Americans in a prison in Pakistan suspected of being connected to extremists.
The men were imprisoned for attacking a house in Sargoda in the province of eastern Punjabi, as reported by the BBC to the US Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI has reported that this is an investigation into whether these are the same men who have been reported missing in the last month at their home in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs has stated that this is also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are mentioned as originating in Pakistan, one of which has Egyptian ancestors, and the others are from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and under what circumstances they were staying there," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit reported that the agency had been informed of the imprisonment and had been in contact with the families of missing students.
"We will work with Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here, and whether they are really missing students," she said.
Pakistani embassy in Washgington reported that men were arrested in a house belonging to uncles of one of them.
He said that the house was always the center of interest of local police and that there were no charges against arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, told the Reuters press agency, but stated that the United States must "co-operate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in spreading the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train persons".
The disappearance of these five students from home in North Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejection of amnesty for Iranian abusers.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, as stated in the Amnesty International expedition report.
The report describes in detail the 'problems of torture' in the regime before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran and dozens were killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Tens of them were arrested, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five people to death.
A BBC writer in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, stated that, earlier in protests, Ayjatolah Ali Chomejní had declared the unauthorizedness of certain forms of torture and banned their execution in the Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticisms of legal power have been tolerated, as our correspondent stated.
Untrue confession'
Amnesty International quoted a report by a 26-year-old student in the field of computer technology Ibrahim Methari, who stated that he had been accused of "working with Facebook" and protests against election results.
"I was often beaten in the face," he said in his statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened my execution and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the elections and tortured to death in prison, and the others were raped.
Iranian senior civil servants denied rape charges, but admitted that torture was taking place.
Amnesty also reported the case of a former prisoner who said that he was held in a container with other 75 people for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and justice had set up committees to investigate the post-election riots and reactions of the government, but stated that the mandate and powers of the institutions were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees had been published.
The group stated that at least 90 people were detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform the monument in Bristol into a ski track for the race.
The downhill track for the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the Brandon Hill ski slope, there was a short jumping bridge 100 m long downhill.
John Hickman, a fourth year of medicine student, said that it was a wonderful view from the top of the ski slope, but that it was really depressing.
It was a beautiful view of the city's flashing lights downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
Awards were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the ski slope.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Could he be a Muslim Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters called for a ban on the construction of minerals and, in general, the alarm messages about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed on whether the Muslims could integrate - and whether they integrate - into one of the most open secular societies of the continent.
After reading this book, some of the readers became admirers of the author's last work, "Why the French don't like the scarfs on their heads" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on disputed issues that have divided and employed the country for 15 years and whose impact is still felt today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a wider and much more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and media said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the core.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now take care of 5  to 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproduces debates between teachers and students on the issues that most concern them.
Should Muslim enter the marriage union in the mosque or the city hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can Muslimka marry a man who isn't a Muslim?
Does Muslima have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to secure a mortgage?
These are the seemingly worldly contentious issues that are being discussed, and which are part of everyday life rather than political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known persons, not including Tarika Ramadana, Araba, a Muslim researcher and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a discussion on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are distrustful of the true idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists Mr Bowen has interviewed are inclined to believe that this is the counter-warrant of Selafi—the supporters of the purist Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but affects the European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
It raises the question of how far French politicians (and intellectual elites who so fervently defend the layman public) are truly devoted to the idea of pluralism.
It considers that Muslims are likely to have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he discovered "strengthening value screws".
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say, "Yes, but not now."
The Most Relentless Perspectives in the World
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet's environment.
The bordering ice is at an alarming rate, which affects animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In the book "On thin ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the North's icons, a polar bear.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and practice of whalery describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to capture a white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a brave 14-year-old lifeguard who fought only the muskets is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their just killed mothers were caught and sent to the zoo and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears suddenly performed in one circus tent.
Even today the zoo has a typical area of a million times smaller than that of the adult in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the holow hairs of its coat.

Mr Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten to survive species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunting is made from helicopters and Indians on skis, and they are all armed with powerful attack manuals that shoot off their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "The Ice" Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unconsolidated responsibility of science for the Arctic and an enticing glimpse of how the future can change it.
No, scientists have answers for everything.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have adequate response to the rate of change.
It's for lack of exams.
Fridtjof Nansen's research routes at the end of the 19th and early 20th century indicated for the first time how the floating ice moves.
The submarines during the Cold War then maped the shifting shifts as they sailed.

In a few months... it could be us'
6000 members of the Marine Corps laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he never met.
For him and the other members of the Marine Corps who took the journey from the Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington, to decorate the graves, that was the day when they paid tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months when we board, it could be us, he told Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I do.
He was one of over 6000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the cemetery veterans in several departments during the Friday's act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during the Friday act in Arlington.
Now it's an 18-year-old tradition where Mr. nMoril and his wife Karen take this road every year and stop in different cities along the way to honor the memory of members of the army and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for profit, wreaths across America, which they are putting in other states.
This year, the volunteers laid more than 16,000 prisoners in the Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon territory, on graves in Fayetteville National Cemetery, Arkansas, Battery Park, New York City, and the memorial site of flight 93 United Airlines, Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has spent more than $150000 on the purchase and transport of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, stated that she had taken a trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way of returning what the victim was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Covered in the warm coats, volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves from the First and Second World War and from the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive when the kids played and held hands together when they were transporting the young pine to the gray tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red bow of the top part.
Around 60, where most of the veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were buried, really remained silent.
The association of services dedicated 1000 prisoners to the decoration of the separation, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled this area.
Some wept honestly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in cold air.
Some read out loud names, carved into stones, while others bowed to see small black and white names, pushed into wet mud where tombstones were not yet placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who lamented tears from their eyes in front of her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanefield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of Sergeant David Shane Spicer's E.R. artillery, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're single.

American government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned an American government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as reported by Foreign Office officials on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the American interest section in Havana, sought access to the detainee who was imprisoned on December 5.
Certain charges have not been made public, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is referred to as "hazardous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being followed and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country in order to take over the prices, but the authorisation has been denied.
The U.S. contractor's detention may be due to the growing tension between the Communist Castro brother, ruling in Cuba, and Obama's administration, which has been followed as a "continuance tactic" in improving relations with the island.
The first to report the New York Times incarceration on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average wage of a civil servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban Government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are usually used after sending text messages, because a 15-minute telephone call would cost more than one daily wage.
The use of internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available at expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
The Cubans who often want to apply must notify their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the U.S. citizens in a prison in Cuba are behind bars for violence such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, press officer of the U.S. Section for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
Prison and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's call it free mobile phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, the director of the U.S. Human Rights Group, who recently published an adverse report on freedom in Cuba, called "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country and a replacement for the rich older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as these two countries are moving towards greater dialogue.
Pakistani civil servants are covering a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities revealed an alleged leader of a conspiracy to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of U.S. troops, and reported that they hoped that this case might help spread a vast network of terrorist recruiters who are online and looking for radicalized young men.
The investigators reported that they were searching for a grey rebel personality known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men posted a commentary approving terror attacks with a YouTube video site.
Saifillah took over the leadership of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, tried to help them get to the remote area of Pakistan in the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer who reported the case stated on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaeda commanders and that men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for a few days in the eastern district of Sarghody, far from the terrible mountains in the northwest, which became a refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a strike unit.
An official who spoke about keeping anonymity in the light of the sensitivity of the case stated why they were suspended.
The official stated that the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain permission to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the execution of Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and has been questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, identifying who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence service has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources into al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be spies.
American false recruits were subjected to a special investigation in al-Qaeda, reported by analysts.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because, given their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation, based in the U.S., said that terrorist groups have also become significantly more careful in recent years in allowing the cat to join them, because the U.S. intelligence agencies have acquired experts in their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has been followed so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is far more web based.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate action.
Tens of thousands of protesters marched the streets this Saturday and demanded a stronger climate action from the negotiators at the Bella City Congress Center.
The protesters reported the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police are sending the number closer to 25000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid several small loads near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day when a small incident occurred in the UN climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city, carrying banners with English inscriptions "This is not planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish, which declared "The earth says 'enough'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including a Danish model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who stated that she had traveled to her mother's hometown in Peru and provided me with information on the uncomfortable state of the country in which the impact of climate change is still taking place.
That's part of the reason why we decided to join this big march -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leaders to make a fair, ambitious and binding deal, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided.
The police prevented the protesters from approaching the center of Bella, stating that they had arrested 19 people, first of all because they had either masks or pocket knives on them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers who doesn't want to be identified because he is involved in climate horns, activists masked as athletes and in black suits have laid several charges near Copenhagen's main channel, which is located near several ministries.
Agitated at the buildings, said, launched with flares, but then followed by "a few great explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably didn't come to the attention of key officials, such as Su Weie, the leading Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (i do not really realize).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the stage is wide, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on the prospects of everyone.
The focus of the general public and the various sectors and subject matter of climate change is visible, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that this is a violation of the negotiations or the freedom of others.
The date of the test revealed persistent persistent racial differences
The federal certificate from last week about the knowledge of mathematics was a welcome element of good news about public education in the district of Columbia.
Although the district is far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate has shown more progress in fourth and eighth grade pupils over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains behind the last figures of the National Certificate Centre for progress in teaching are persistent differences in knowledge between African-Americans and white students, both locally and on a national level.
The average result of white pupils in the fourth class of Columbia in the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from possible 500), but their African-American peers have only grown by three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge actually increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress with the eighth grade African-Americans remains broadly balanced, with a deviation of a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The mean result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the size of the sample was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year period is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between the white and black pupils of the fourth grade in 2003, when the first NAEP was carried out in the district, was 60 points in the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result has improved in children from both groups during this period, the difference is hardly close to 58.
In the last week, some advocates of education in the district have expressed that the results, celebrated by mystery Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more extensive in white students where the results were already high.
That would suggest that we increased the sum of support for those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality of education in the precinct.
I don't jump up and down due to a distraction of two or three points, said D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade primary school in Eaton.
Often criticising Mrs Rhea's governance style, Mrs Brown said that the report on the results of the test means that secondary education in the city is in desperate condition and requires attention.
Clearly, you always want to see the pros, and I respect that.
But what's horrifying is that we didn't spend almost any time and energy that we needed to devote to our secondary education.
Mrs Rhea said that the efforts of the precinct are continuing to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained to use the new curriculum, Wilson's reading system, aimed at students of the higher classes of primary schools and high school students who could not handle the basics of reading earlier in their collegiate careers and significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics and mathematics curriculum into the sixth grade, highlighting the games and experience of real life that got into the precinct for former director Clifford Janeyi, can be added to the progress of the NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I just think that we should continue to work and perform the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the level of the class, said Mrs. Rhea.
Others stated that NAEP results explained whether Mrs Rhea could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the gap.
It is a certain winning dilemma by Mrs. Michell Rhea, said Bruce Fuller, professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools, located in the worst parts of Columbia District.
Thus, the focus can bring political echoes that are against an important agenda.
But the blame also belongs to other city directors who are trying to keep the average between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We need to strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can count on their children to be given an excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now head of school in Newark, said in an interview this week that the main element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, in order to exercise the rightfulness of schools.
You must receive up to 200 days to enforce the changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his teachers' association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers as a "symptom" for finding a bigger increase next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
The tour bus entered the Gettysburg College with a loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, performed and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gracie's parents barely graduated from a college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the attic of the dorm.
Now she and the other eighth grade students in the group studied Gettysburg, where the school fees amounted to $38690 a year, their position was rather than scared visitors to the enthusiasm of potential students.
Yes! She called out Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the knowledge building.
Wow, really? She thoughtfully when they gave them a low professor's ratio to the students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of the seven who visited their three-day tour and were now completely interested in the future: The question is whether you will enter the dormitory.
The question is from where?
However, this is a bearer problem regarding the high number of born children of Spanish immigrants born in the US who are excluded from colleges or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive rail education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "big generation" of Spanish college pupils - remarkable results show that many of their migrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, have entered the United States without completing their college.
Their story of success is important, researchers say, because it underlines their point of travel forward for a generation that played a marginal role in the field of the labour force of the country.
Those who achieved a university education say that they had a natural affection for school and an innate breakthrough and an effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and millions of children who would like to go to college - especially if they survive in time.
Taking into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have experience and the ability to help them understand the system, any simple intervention at each individual point will not solve it, says Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a pre-school network in all ways to get through college.
The federal program, which financed Graciela's rail trip, is a useful example.
Known as the GEAR UP (prepare), it provides over 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to launch railway preparatory programmes that start for students from small-income groups in high school and continue until these students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the programme has served more than 10 million students, more than % of whom have entered the dormitory, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fear of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government was able to get significant oil companies to reconstruct their weak infrastructure during two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements were concluded by the Iraqi oil industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in restoring the Iraqi oil industry, paralyzed by decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies left with capital participation in just two out of 10 fields.
Seven American companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
Only one made a lost offer.
Two American companies reached agreements on a field that was auctioned in June.
The lucrative participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here first on the road of Asians and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online intelligence.
It's gonna be a long time before something else is going to be in Iraq for sale.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely to discourage American companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has the third largest raw material reserves, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies have been at a disadvantage, especially the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that made deals with the Ministry.
The leading American companies, such as Chevron and ConcoPhillips, who maintained close contact with the Iraqi oil industry ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts that were allocated at the end of this week.
The State of China National Petroleum Corp. participated in bids for more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become the main economic, as well as technological force, said the spokesman of the oil industry Assam Jihad.
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and will comply with its commitments to Iraq.
Companies which were provisionally selected for submission of tenders, which were then compared by the Ministry at the price of barrels and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level on each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
With the impact of the U.S. missile off the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, apparently the top al-Qaeda operations planner was killed, as announced by U.S. counter-terrorism officials on Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several missiles landed on their car near the town of Miran Sah in the province of Severní Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have deduced that the missiles were launched from an unmanned aircraft of type operated by the CIA in the zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were led to a white car, which was headed towards the Afghan border when he was hit, by an official along with a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency who was on the phone from Miran Shah.
Official said that the local armed forces came to a point and quickly confiscated what was left of "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officers quoted an unspecified witness who stated that Somalia was post-mortem.
Somalia was listed as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military operation planner who managed operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the renovations around the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be appointed, who mentioned the sensitive nature of the American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Qaeda's top management and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another American official said that Somalia quickly advanced in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a well-known person for some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, said another official.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of the Al-Qaida or the Taliban who should have been killed since September when Najmudin Jalolov was killed in a similar attack, the leader of a militant faction in the band of indigenous tribes and three other top postpertative leaders.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using unmanned aircraft has decreased since the summer from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to the Long War log, a website, managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may have a reason for improving the tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also unmercifully killing those who suspected to be informants, the party stated.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Kabul has resigned.
The United Nations top delegate in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would like to resign from his post in March and thus end the turbulent term of office, which was undermined by the allegations of widespread corruption in the election of the President of Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure is taking place because Obama's administration has decided to send another 30,000 American soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate stated that he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US timetable for reducing the situation, which began in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO countries to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they are to have confidence in the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The undertaking entered into must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian workers helping in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the part of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign, but that he simply kept a promise that he gave to his family in March 2008 that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has now stated that he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it is high time to look for the successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has launched a search for a replacement.
Officials stated that it was between Staffan di Mistura, who had Swedish-Italian origin and had previously conducted the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, France, which had previously conducted the UN peacekeeping operation.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the presidential election from masking the presence of massive electoral machines.
Eide denied these claims, but stated that Galgraith's accusations -- which was released -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of scepticism in terms of international intervention" in the election.
Eide stated that he had proposed a meeting with the Supreme Representative of the citizens to coordinate the easing of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the United Nations leadership to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, so he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at limiting his efforts in Afghanistan and stated that the UN’s difficult-to-do recruitment regulations undermine its ability to use its capabilities.
The UN rules are that I had the opportunity to obtain only one person from May, he said.
It's a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers will soon impose "other significant sanctions" on Iran because of a lack of commitment in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in Northern Iraq during a week's journey to areas where war in Afghanistan and Iraq, ignored the prospects of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question of likely development.
One of the things that depend on me is whether I've learned something from Iraq over the past six years, [this] is an irresistible improbability in the war.
Obama's administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that "the package of incentives and inhibitions" would require "to make the Iranian government feel less secure with nuclear weapons" because "their inhabitants will suffer extremely" by sanctions.
According to the opinion issued by the White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the administration involved the European leader in the warning that Iran will suffer serious consequences unless it brings its nuclear programme into full compliance with the UN Committee on Nuclear Safety and its Supervisory Authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to interviews on the limitation of his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial part of his supply of enriched uranium in exchange for the urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
Administration has been set up for such an agreement as a way to establish confidence between the two parties and to gain time for the negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to withdraw from the interim agreements - partly because of this, the expert states, because the Iranian leadership is divided in opinions on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, as far as the Iranian stubbornness towards the international community is concerned with some of the proposals that he actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think it has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together, to a journey that is not about terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, has told Gates.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including surveillance, which the foreign minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrade sanctions".
In an opinion issued in New York, the U.N. Mission condemned on Thursday what it called "unfounded and unfounded accusations" against some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and stated that it wanted to continue its discussions with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday morning, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before leaving for Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
There is a high level of tension between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, especially due to borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts in order to prevent US plans from being delayed to limit the number of American soldiers from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates was also trying to quell Kurd's concern about the persistent depression. The US official places quoted Gates when he told Massoud Barzaan, President of the Kurdish regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, changing course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters where they read that "The mother of the earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave".
Then they learned that when official government places in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth rates and the ageing population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reactions were immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We didn't save anything for others, says Wang, 31 years old, a human resources manager who has an eight-month-old son.
For more than 30 years, China’s policy of having only one child has been put in place and thus created two generations of only notoriously bobbled and degenerate children, with an even-named "small emperors", threatens the population crisis.
The average birth rate decreased to 1.8 children per pair compared to six before the policy entry into force, according to UN data.
The distribution of the population, where the population aged 60 and above is predicted to rise turbulently from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. That is far above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is greater rich coastal cities with a university education population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over were almost 22 percent in Shanghai of registered residents, while birth rates were less than one child per pair.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission for Population and Family Planning, said, many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and reduce the number of labour in the future".
He says it's about being old, that doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden.
Gradual reassurance
As inserted into the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is still probably the most controversial mandate established by the Communist Party.
The couples who violated politics faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
The Chinese official posts were promoting a policy that helped the country to prevent the critical use of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned in the promotion of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women to undergo abortion during a second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexual selection abortions leading to an unnaturally high ratio between men and women.
In recent years, population officials were gradually milder in their opinion on the policy of one child.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions - including the inhabitants of cities, members of national minorities, and cases where men and women were singles -- and in 2007 they mitigated the distribution of their passwords, promoting a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Peking University's population research institute, said that central government officials had previously debated more radical changes as an opportunity for couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incite more births.
Almost overnight, posters, admonishing parents to have only one child, replaced by copies of regulations, detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and put flyers under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, the family planning officers reported.
A Reaction That Amazes
Although officials in one rural town in the area of Shanghai saw an increase in the interest of couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most of the city districts did not report changes.
Huinan District with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases a month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai reported that despite the campaign, the number of born in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Shanghai Family Planning Committee, stated that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and was legally allowed.
But like many Chinese who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a target network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the politics of one child as a question of disputed law, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in union with the first child.
Yes, we've been deprived of a chance to have more than one child.
But the problem isn't just politics.
It's about the money.
Other couples report psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the manager of human resources, says they only want one child, because she was also an only child: "We were the centre of the attention of our families and everyone cared for us.
We were not used to provide care, and we did not really want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who owns a translation company, expressed this much more uncoveredly.
For middle-class parents, who reduced birth rate, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today, 20 and 30 - year - olds view their parents as the first days of China’s experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of living for themselves, says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on parents' time, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still disputed questions to the propsor -- "You must rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You must have a resumé prepared at the time when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, says Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher standards of nutrition, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The United Nations-sponsored climate conference -- characterised by far-reaching undisciplined attitudes and mutualisation -- refocused on the release on Friday of a document proposing ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialised nations carrying most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which can provide a starting point for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, emphasises the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But important progress was seen in negotiations that took place at the wrong time with over 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the United Nations ad hoc working group, this text inconspicuously states how much money rich countries should provide to the poor in order to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of key issues choices, including how to develop and manage emerging economies, so that they can limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit of a global temperature rise that policymakers will still be able to tolerate.
This adds a large dose of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, head of the Washington club Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, building a text from 180 pages of the meeting to focus on what the top climate officer at the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
It outlinees a possible agreement in which the industrial nations could jointly reduce their emissions to 25 to 45 per cent in comparison to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions to 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union has discussed quickly on Friday the promise that it will provide $3.6 trillion in the next three years to help poorer countries adopt adaptations to climate change -- from flood management and drought to preventing deforestation.
Still Friday, however, he introduced the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed during the conversations last week.
The U.S. Special Ambassador on climate issues Todd Stern rejected the speech requiring binding greenhouse gas emission reductions for industrial countries compared to the voluntaryity of major emerging economies if they were not financed by the developed world.
The shift signaled that Obama’s administration had put a harder line on China by the Bush administration just two years ago.
The United States will not enter the treaty without the transfer of the main developing countries and the implementation of the actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be examined by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after China’s Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei communicated to the US’s Chief Climate Negotiator that either the lack of a “selish reason” or “extraordinary irresponsibility” had led earlier in the week to the announcement that the United States would not have helped China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the world’s major powers at stake, the world’s developing world and the industrial world and emerging economies broke out.
The current fight is taking place mostly on the preservation of individual economies rather than on the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States as regards the fulfilment of their respective commitments, while the poorer nations point out that the two tens of most influential countries in the world are ignoring scientific imperatives to carry out stronger actions.
Ricardo Ulate, the Costa Rica delegate, said it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers from responsibly in their actions.
It is a clear game about the development of new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional advisor for regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries that are the most vulnerable influences of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue the enforcement of the legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be the political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members has created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said that the enforcement of small island nations "has triggered a political clap on the whole polar process" partly because they are now united and require action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations brought about a new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of government competed for an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as the Indian Minister for the Environment Jairam Rameš and the Chinese Deputy Minister, have stepped out of the aircraft and have taken place through the halls of the center of Bella to closed meeting doors and new conferences, so that they could set out the claims that will be assessed next week.
The total extent of the assembly - when 13,000 people moved from and to the Congress Centre each day, guitars played by activists performed an ironic spectacle of the countries they thought they had sent them, and the hand-to-hand motions were handed over to the paper rather than by e-mail -- under a challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier in the middle of 60 Heads of State.
We have reached high levels, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for Global Policy in International Nature Protection.
There's heavy weight coming in.
The British first train at 140 miles an hour covered this Monday's feelings
5:13 p.m., on Monday morning, the whistle cut the darkness into the sign of the departure of the train, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent to St Pancras, London, and will cross a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed passenger set outside LLndýn.
He hopes that the new service will eventually link Britain to the international network of fast, reliable trains and link the great agglomerations of the Midland, the North and Scotland to London.
Deprived standing waters should be reduced in passenger and business times and the transition from aircraft and cars to railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties have been granted a vision.
But the tens of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now slowed down the construction of British high-speed lines.
The High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide a viable study to the government, forwarded its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as the Times stated.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned high-speed network.
The new route between London and West Midland was proposed within five metres in urban areas and districts, where the impact on the environment could be problematic.
The open landscape was planned in 25 m of the final route.
HS2 also assumes to determine three choices for an extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option is the Y-shaped configuration, where one high-speed line should lead to western Midland.
The line should be shared near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most efficient choice has taken place," said the railway expert.
Once it's done, the driving times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals should allow trains to travel at a speed of 2250 miles an hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already proposed to carry trains of 400 m length which would be able to transport 1100 persons.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be able to serve up to 20000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would expand to capture a high-speed network.
Railway experts argue that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken before the general elections.
Even if it puts the wheels in motion, the net should be built in pieces.
Trains should first put into operation not on high-speed lines, but already existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain driving times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive point of contact to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, an indicative point for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers paid a mortgage of £75000 on Tory's orangery
Alan Duncan, holder of the Tory's front seat bench in the Chamber of Deputies, paid thousands of pounds of costs last year for the orangery he built in his house in the constituency.
a party spokesperson for a prison that was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the Members lived "from donations", increased their mortgage to £75000 to build an oak-clad extension in their second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, in total hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The local authorities approved the claims in time, so he was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legge, who carried out the checks on the Member States' expenditures. Last night Mr Duncan said his demands "it was supposed to be cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
There's a kitchen on the ground floor, a living room and a dining room, but the Financial Office has agreed that Mr Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which in the plans is called "orangerie".
The neighbors describe it as "a glass for entertainment and hospitality."
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide some explanation for the increased loan during the last check by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last settlement of the mortgage.
The Committee informed him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pupilary security to a mortgage of £271406 from his property in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the Chamber of Deputies.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed around £1,400 a month in the interests of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds per month.
The interest of Mr Duncan's RBS's mortgage payments could not have changed at this time, suggesting that it was all intended to finance a loan of £75000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage payments decreased in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year, which remained.
The last document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1250 per month this May.
Mr Duncan left his job as a shadow head of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed it and said that MPs had to survive the spending scandal.
"As a matter of fact, it's nationalized, you have to live on the ration and treat you as s**t."
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and my claim and a small fraction on what needed to be done.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
A millionaire from his former career as a oil dealer was first invited to explain his release in May, when it turned out that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the Financial Office, that this could be "excessive".
One of the activists dug a pound pit in Mr. Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he had claimed 4000 pounds for three years.
When asked about the increase in the mortgage last night, Mr Duncan said, "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the Financial Office and the Legge."
He added: "It is not a disputed question of hiding and clattering or breaking the rules or something else.
It's an absolute straight line down, by the rules, justified and that's it.
This would not be the case with many other ways cleaner or simpler."
Come and look carefully at the cottage on the Brighton coast with an advent calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton found a new meaning of life in winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages entanglement with creativity called on 24 owners to decorate their cottages every day in December, and to use Christmas wheels as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1st, when it allowed visitors to visit the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 each day, and the Bishop's bread and welded wine, provided for free.
The selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cottage represented the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, an assistant at Hove TV marketing, is a priest without a scholarship in the Chicago Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in the post - Christian society.
"Why should we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in a waking way.
"The idea of the Advent Calendar in chat rooms was created just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and pulsating place and we have tried to try and present it spiritually."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and Copenhagen, where the police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people by police resources and 100,000 by organizers manifested in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement by Friday, which could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, which is clear evidence of current manifestations, contributed to the fact that the 'political tax' of any failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to the AFP journalist, there were incidents in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the parade, when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break the windows with pavements and hammers.
Order police hit the ground immediately.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-radical separate groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "no difference" and stressed that about a hundred were in ties and in the sitting room "retained in the streets still on Saturday night" despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade peacefully set out to Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
A podium was built for the speakers, before which a spiritual candle meeting took place, with the participation of the former Archbishop of Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
Most protesters came by bus and train from major European cities, and besides Africans there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Korean.
Almost 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue capes created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning at the challenge of the Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "fair climate".
Today, we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of the environmental debt in favour of the South, explained People Nacpilová, a Philippine fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer think: it's time for that, said the benin' singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and water streams are drying out, we can walk in them today, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the struggle for another world was closer to environmental organisations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the characters of the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world".
The first demonstrations began in the Asian-Thai Sea area, in which many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming are located.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people came out in Australia.
There were several hundred people marching in Manila, mostly students, in red clothes, and scarves that provoke the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundreds of demonstrators have gone out on the streets demanding a strong measure against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in the protests organized by the "350" movement, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (Western) and Lyon (East).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia chose her president, Georgia condemns it as a "fake"
Abkhazia chose her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognised this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this move to be a "farm".
About 131000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The election rooms closed at 17 hours GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closing of the Electoral Chambers.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday night on Sunday.
All five candidates, including President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia which condemned these elections.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "is sorry that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian domination," said his spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognised the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After the conflict in 1992-1993, in which several thousands of people died, Abkhazia tries to show through the elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said the letter AFP Kvarčija Světlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapš.
She was one of those who came to vote for the election room at the school in the capital of Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the main topic of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea shore, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagapš are placed next to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who arrived to supervise the successful election process were given a warm reception by the district mayor Beslan Arsba.
"We Abkhaz, we are grateful," said he at a small ceremony, referring to the support of Moscow and, in particular, its decision to acknowledge the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament and drank vodka to it.
The opposition, represented in the elections by former Vice-President Raul Khadzhimba and two merchants Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the contracts concluded with Moscow last year, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control the Abkhazia railway network for a period of 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he doesn't support the current government or the opposition.
A 50% plus one vote is required to win the elections.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive battle must take place within two weeks.
Climate: world manifestations, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people by police resources and a hundred thousand by organizers manifested afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which has hosted delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, who could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade peacefully set out to Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
A podium was built for the speakers, before which a spiritual candle meeting took place, with the participation of the former Archbishop of Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP journalist, there were incidents shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred demonstrators dressed in black and armed bricks and hammers began to break their windows.
Order police immediately surrounded them and hit them without waiting, while several protestants hit the ground.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-radical separate groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, one of the officers on the jaw was injured by a pavement, and four cars near the squat near the incidents that resulted from the arrest of about 20 people according to police sources.
We focus on extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the police helicopters went up again.
Most protesters who came by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were a lot of Asians, including several Chinese and Korean or African.
Almost 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue capes created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning at the challenge of the Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "fair climate".
Today, we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of the environmental debt in favour of the South, explained People Nacpilová, a Philippine fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bová, one of the characters of the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world".
Oxfam has called on several well-known personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asian-Thai Sea area, in which many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming are located.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people came out in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people manifested in front of the town hall of the Philippines, mainly students in red clothes and scarves that provoke the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta several hundreds of demonstrators have also met with the demand for strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in the protests organized by the "350" movement, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (Western) and Lyon (East).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general gymnasium, said Chatel.
The Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated on Sunday during an interview for the magazine JDD that history and geography will be "strengthened" in the context of the reform of general high school, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the last year of high school with a focus on exact science.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week, and for everyone there will be the same program of general culture, confirmed Chatel.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to stop hypocrisy" because according to him specialization S is no longer focused on exact science" but "in essence there are the best students in it".
EC and L specializations cannot be for any sub-specializations, continues and emphasises: 'I did not go to many historians and intellectuals who would complain that in the last year of professional high schools they did not learn geography and history'.
The study of Ifop, which was published by Humanité on Saturday, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) disagreed with the government's project to cancel the compulsory history and geography teaching in the senior year with S specialization, which is why many intellectuals and teachers criticised this cancellation, both the left and some right-wing Members.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "not taken into account" to cancel philosophy in the specialization program With the senior year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform of teaching, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for the participation in Tuesday's mobilisation against this project, which according to them offers the educational education of future gymnasium professors.
In the course of Master's Study 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year he will undergo a admission test focused on their field and at the end of the year another exam verifying their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
He will take part in professional internships during the second year of his Master's degree and will perform as an intern professor in front of the pupils in the first year.
If you add all the internships that will be offered to you before the admission procedure, you will gain more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, continued.
The Minister also announced that he would propose a 'personal right to education', which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At École University, the elite normal supérieure experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the Copenhagen Summit's objectives: this is a challenge announced in the Council this morning by Jean Jousel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) at the initiative of Ecole Normale Supérieure on Ulm Street.
As reported by one AFP journalist, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jousel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, which is a kind of one-day seminar composed of fifteen-minute contributions by experts who will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people, and on the basis of which they should want to learn more, explained on the occasion of the conference 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named after a fish from a local pond named after the students.
About twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines will be selected and specified that the choice is based on their charisma.
About warming up the climate "we can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic targets in a few minutes" said AFP Jean Jousel, who spoke before 50 listeners without pre-prepared notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that the listeners will know that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific basis".
Videos made at these lectures will be placed on the school's website from December 15th.
The next seminar "Ernest" is planned for February and the next will follow with regularity every two months.
Late payment: angry prison overseers, planned measures
The prison overseers announced "general mobilisation" on Friday as they demand that bonuses and overtime be paid for Christmas holidays, which were postponed for financial reasons.
The prison FO (2nd supervisory department) asked employees who would not have a service to participate in the demonstration held on Tuesday morning in front of the prison facilities, and to "block" them and to alert them about "theft of their wages".
The CGT for the prison overseers (3rd branch of this sector) called on them to "call meetings in individual prisons and start a major mobilization" with the fact that it is "lost and unacceptable" that "times and allowances for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays" worked in October should not be paid in December.
The first supervisory departments, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for overall mobilisation (...) in order to demonstrate dissatisfaction and indignation".
The Directorate-General and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased significantly in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but ensure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The chancellery stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari sent a message to the prison overseers' departments, which assures them that the payment will be made next month.
I know about the efforts that prison staff make to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes to the Minister in his communication.
I ordered the prison administration to take immediate measures so that the situation, which was created by a poor evaluation of the number of overtimes, would never be repeated in the future, was added to Minister Alliot-Mari.
The December wage will therefore be low, with the exception of managers who receive the famous premium for performing their duties and achieving their objectives, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those "a place will always be found in the budget".
It's just a scandal, the FO interregional union in Marseille became angry and announced its decision to boycott until the appeal of "all meetings and appeals".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays, unless they are paid for these days from October in December as well as overtime, the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
At a time when they're giving us more and more work and tasks without giving us more staff at our disposal, it's sad to let the lowest employees pay for it, says CGT-prisoners in Bordeaux.
According to the union, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, there is little money, said Secretary General Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives "better gifts" at Christmas than the ones he gets
The American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, has committed to the "Goddess" of the Oprah Winfrey screen that with regard to gifts, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I get".
The President and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the series, which will be broadcast on Sunday night at ABC Station about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious dwelling.
Even Bo, a little four-legged companion of the family gets his cut.
Jesus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog also "of course" will get a gift, as is apparent from the passages from the pre-transmission series.
And Michelle Obama also opposed her husband's claim on the topic of the quality of gifts she gets: "Well, I certainly did not, I gave you great gifts last year," she teased the president.
Well, of course that's true, he was forced to agree to the President, but immediately after he had a sense of humor, he showed his finger on the first lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?"
In this one-day, very relaxed show with a famous moderator who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obama's husbands also spoke about their most unpopular gifts as children.
Barack Obama introduced a ten-degree transmission bike, but also a basketball ball, which was dedicated to him at Christmas by his Kenyan father, with whom he rarely met.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas, and when he gave me the basketball ball, the President told me.
It wasn't until long after I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady remembered the dollhouse again.
I didn't know how to organize all this in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little doll house, and I remembered Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday operated again, RTL states he's in an artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles because of the "harmful" created after a major operation he had experienced in France, but the situation is according to his closest "control" while RTL station stated that the singer is in an artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
A 66-year-old rocker was again operated on the night from Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found the "harmfuls resulting from the operation" of the impaled plaque he had made in Paris on 26 November, he communicated his press department in Paris, with the fact that these lesions required "correction surgery".
However, the singer's press department tried to calm the public down and stated that the situation was "controlled" and at the same time announced that a new medical communication would be released within 48 hours.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put to an artificial sleep to avoid "pains and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll be a little more confident, he's delivering RTL.
The press department, on a request from AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources", after the first operation in Paris, no drain was placed.
Rocker was operating at the Parc Monceau International Clinic because of a scorched fence.
The operation, which was planned several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a physician well known in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL information.
After this operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection that occurred after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, said on Thursday on RTL radio that his boyfriend was going through a "bad period" but he added that he didn't worry about the rocker because he's a big "fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid things because spending 12 hours on a plane after such surgery is no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer Jean-Claude Camus calmed the situation, who stated that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics", and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he did not notice any special concerns.
The health problems of the singer have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after he fell on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of everyone, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small tumor of the small intestine" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, each of his health problems has been very monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to dement the new hospitalization report again.
Euro-2009/small swimming pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
French Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the 2009 World Cup in a large swimming pool, won the 2009 European Championship on Thursday in a small swimming pool in Istanbul in a discipline he particularly likes: 50m free way.
On the first day of the championship, on which the overalls were last allowed, only three world records fell, although many more were expected.
One of them exceeded the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová to a 200 m position race and the two remaining male staff of Russia to 4x50 m position race.
A great sorrow for Bousquet, who made a difference to the world record on the 50m freeway, which he already holds in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, 50m free way, the 28-year-old Frenchman won the final 20.53 seconds in the finals, where ten swimmers started in the first place instead of eight.
Bousquet defeated Croat Duje Draganja (20,70) and Rus Sergei Fesikov (20,84), but failed to overcome the world record (20,30) as he assumed.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if there's a world record in my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore suits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from 1 January.
The combinations helped from February 2008 to 238 world records, and their era ended in Istanbul, which was the first to host them in 1999 in the same competition.
Even Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in a large swimming pool in Rome this time, had a world record at hand.
Young swimmers failed to overcome the record, which holds the 400 meters free way (3:32.77), but still won the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew this time I wouldn't break the world record, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: Zola’s Roman sarcophagus record was auctioned for $1.5 million
The roman sarcophagus board, which belonged to no one other than French writer Emil Zol, was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, which is much more than estimated, said the art dealer Sotheby ́s.
The price of this two meter long and 63 cm high frontal plate, dating from the third century C.E., was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchants is a rare piece, there are very few similar pieces in the world, perhaps four or five," said the AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby ́s.
The work was sold among hundreds of others.
The sales are still taking place, but it is an object that has been put on about the most, communicated to the AFP spokesperson Sotheby ́s, Dan Abernethy.
Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble was detected a few days ago.
The board was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous Borgia family collection and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated the bath with it in her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and shortly before Marshal Petain became president of the Council.
That's where she stayed for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered while searching the museum database in Louvre that this album was part of the "residues of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, one year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Disturbed attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
On Thursday, Mexico concluded that the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown President Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to which the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure were not fulfilled.
After the phone call I had last night with President Zelaya, everything so far suggests that there is no way to make this transfer possible, reported to the Mexican Foreign Secretary, Patricia Espinos.
The Mexican government plane, which flew back to El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya, reported the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The government of purges wanted to force President Zelaya to "demise" and to apply for political asylum abroad would only give him the opportunity to leave safely.
But the overthrown president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the exile head of state.
The government of purges "has experienced another failure when it wanted me to give up my post..., they wanted me to resign", said Zelaya on Thursday to the Globo radio, in which he often speaks about the political crisis which has been in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, I've got a dropped president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, and he's played some chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an application for asylum, said on Wednesday the Minister of Interior of the Puchist Government, Oscar Raul Matute to the Hondura radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for Telesur Station, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as the president of the Hondura people, stressed.
The rumors of Zelaya's departure have mobilized in the middle of a supporter of the overthrown president who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army strengthened protection.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the puchist government.
This shows their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who came close to the socialist President Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on 28 June, on the day he organized in preparation for his re-election of the public consultation against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica he unexpectedly returned on September 21st and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of here, he'll be arrested and held accountable for the high treason crime he's accused of, says the pučist government.
Mr Roberto Micheletti was able to organise the presidential elections to replace President Zelaya on 29 November.
In the controversial elections recognised by the United States but condemned by the Latin American countries as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance encourages optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and the results of the US trade balance show a rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing data, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68,78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with a technological domination of 7,13 points to 2190,06 points.
Index Standard & Poor 500 has improved 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented on Lindsey Piegz from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on half a glass.
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on US trade balance numbers, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October, to $32.9 billion.
On the contrary, the analysts expected an increase in the deficit.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
The growing volume of trade, in particular goods exports, is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the major US trading partners, said Christopher Cornell from the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment has increased against all expectations and the number of job seekers has reached 474,000.
But over the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "at the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The proceeds of government treasures with a view of 10 years increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday night and the yield for 30 years increased to 4.492% compared to 4.408% the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of supporters of the regime whistled "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime whistled out on Thursday the wife of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of the World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration of which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Lam in white", wives or close political prisoners were disbanded directly on the street by supporters of the Raula Castro regime on their march towards the center of the capital with a demand for release of political prisoners, the journalist informed.
Away with the Yankees!, "Militaries!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" chanted with their fists, the dissidents of the regime.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came "to ensure security".
The day before that, there was a similar manifestation against "Ladies in White" in Havana, but there was no injury or arrest.
But in the Vedado district of Havana, about ten dissidents who were also going to manifest themselves on the occasion of the World Human Rights Day were arrested in a civilian area.
According to this journalist, the police have loaded dissidents who have been squealed by the supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours of rule.
The holders of the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, "Ladies in White", organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to the dissent, about 200 political prisoners," stated one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "employees" or "agents" paid by their enemy, the United States.
Finished miracle, Cuban television brought a report about the Thursday demonstration of the government's supporters against the 'refusers of the revolution'.
Cuba with the Communist Party in the lead and politics of the Government of one Party is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disrespecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
Crazy knife killed an 80-year-old man and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, an attacker at the age of 28 allegedly assaulted two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old male in a pharmacy or before her, at the 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
A badly injured old man, born in 1929, died of injury according to the Alliance Police Syndicate in the hospital.
At or before this pharmacy, the assailant assaulted a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband in his 30 ’ s began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80 - year - old man died.
The life of the other injured is in danger, and according to police sources, vital organs have been hit.
A pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as stated by a police source, then fled into the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two more people, probably by accident: a 30-year-old and 40-year-old man, seriously the other one.
How all of this happened is not quite clear, as everything took place in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives carrying the cross behind his back, said on the spot the head of the Alliance Syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the madman, according to the testimony of the AFPs gathered.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation of Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
He was thrown by a crowd, including one of the city policemen who had broken his wrists.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to arrest an armed man while being wounded by their fists, reported a police source.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
They came by to tell me that there's a wounded person out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a large wound to the abdomen, told AFP Frederic Allione, a 30-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, the second person of about 30 years who also had stab wounds with a knife came in.
A man who had no I.D. later arrested the state police.
The D.A. at Nanterre referred the matter to the regional police department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
A suspect assailant was taken to a hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody, waiting for questioning.
The police source did not exclude his location in a psychiatric institution.
Another police source said that six police officers needed him to handle him at a police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "out of control" as "all lunatics of this type, whose power in action increases tenfold."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again asks for the termination of criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the Polish-French director Roman Polanski asked again on Thursdays in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) for the suspension of criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to the moral affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the film director, "Pianist", criticised serious errors in the trial at the time of the 1977 events before three judges of the appeal court of the second district in California.
I demand to stop the prosecution now and immediately, said lawyer Hummel and added that from the behavior of the judge who had decided on the case at that time, Laurence Rittenbanda "had a chill in his back".
According to him, the judge (who already died between) had allegedly treated a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious offense against the rule of law.
The information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and requested), from the mouth of the U.S. Attorney David Wells himself.
But Mr. Wells finally stated by the end of September that he was lying to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to put an end to the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will demand a court hearing in which he will be able to provide evidence of his claim.
The plaintiff repeated what had already been said in the first state, namely that there would be no serious examination of the application for suspension of criminal prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
A 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before a court ruled on "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a teenage girl at the age of 13.
Since then, he has never entered the United States again.
The Deputy Prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
We want to report not only to Romana Polaski in this case, but also to other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs.Asayam.
It is of the opinion that the director "requests favor after trial and despises his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel's lawyer was not the only one who asked to stop Roman Polanski's prosecution.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, has also asked for the termination of the prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear with the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case emerged and added: "Nobody in this room can say that the trial was fair".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by order of the USA
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to his home prison in his cottage in Gstaad, where he was waiting for a possible release.
Wall Street ends in no direction, it's held back by a rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market is falling between indicators that are better than expected in the US and rising dollar price: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing data, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points and Nasdaq, with a technological domination he left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190,31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in the narrow range, the volume of trade has fallen very much, and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected, and which "helped to improve the mood on the market as regards the stability of economic recovery," said analyst Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, and that was already the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the confidence of American consumers also returned and increased strongly in December up to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices have been slowed down by a new increase in the dollar price vis-à-vis the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "pumps down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technology stocks are losing ground under their feet.
The securities market has dropped.
The revenue of the Treasury with a view of 10 years increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday night and with a view to 30 years increased to 4.497% compared to 4.492% a day earlier.
Miss World's election again in South Africa.
After a month of travel across the Republic of South Africa, 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday are going to cross the finish line to achieve their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has been held in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year and for the time being five candidates have won a step into the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Maová from Canada were elected Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a true vortex of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things, and I've had so many experiences!, committed to Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa after the ninth, will be broadcast directly from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 a.m. (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country to wear a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy I could have experienced it twice, and I trusted Miss World Xenia Sukhin in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "land of breath".
After months of performances, exams, meetings with the press and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes to take the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also took part in the election of Aishwarye Rai, a 1994 winner who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is the dream of every woman, but it's not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our countries, and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be introduced in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimwear.
The performance will be presented by Chinese television host Angela Chow, former queen of the beauty of South Africa Michelle McLean and chairman of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
The Republic of South Africa has shown that she can welcome the world of warmth that is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World Competition.
Just like last year safari participated, they visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on the bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
For the president, she noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will remain the Cape Town draw (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, which helped the country a little more to support the event.
I could have met people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Tatachi.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
The reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive", as his son David assured us on Friday's arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong and everything's going very well, said David Hallyday when he got off the plane, which he flew in from Paris a while after 13 p.m. local time (21st hour of world time)
The singer's son, who acted calmly, declared that he would "come as quickly as possible" to the Los Angeles hospital Cedars-Sinaï, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a post-operative infection resulting from surgery with a warmed-up intervertebral plate, which he had undergone on 26 November in Paris.
According to a press release, the singer this night in Los Angeles was "introduced into artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was physicians of the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles already put into an artificial sleep. Hospitalization occurred due to an infection after surgery of a warmed-up intervertebral plate made on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated again at night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance of French Lycea in Los Angeles, attended by their daughter Jade on Friday morning.
Prioritization of the department of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology of the hospital La Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catone, announced that the singer is leaving for Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer was heavily accused by Dr. Stéphana Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on 26 November at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went away too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
I personally spoke to the doctor, and he assured me that this journey was no problem, which surprised me a lot, since I had already suffered twice the loss of the intervertebral plate myself, he added.
A while earlier, on the radio station RTL said that the singer apparently flew away after a Parisian operation without a drone, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very famous in art circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, at which he worked at that time.
In 2007, actress Charlotte Gainsbourg also operated on removal of the haematoma caused by bleeding in the brain.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of malpractice, tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the medical chamber attorney, called him "a man without scruples", who is "regularly" called before the medical chamber, and which cannot be "recommended far away".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux commented on the matter on Friday through his attorney David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure had "exactly good progress" and the post-op examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic, therefore the introduction of the drone was not necessary", he added.
The health problems of the singer have been growing since this summer, and in any case, it seems that his next tour remains with the question mark.
It is clear that the deadline for the renewal of the scheduled tour on January 8th (in Amiens, notes red.) appears too close, said Camus.
The UDF increases the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre to continue to enjoy their shortcuts.
The UDF, controlled by the MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, responded on Friday to the attempt of the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin to take possession of the shortcuts of the former Giscard Party, with the fact that the short term must not be used in any medium under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take a UDF shortcut, saying that François Bayrou did not deserve to carry her inheritance after he had handed his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Mr Hervé de Charetta (former behind-the-UMP now the NC) who credits the property of the UDF brand because he first had it registered at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF Committee, controlled by friends of Françoise Bayrou, who do not intend to be evicted, stepped out of his silence and made a formal request to both the Minister and the Members to stop using the shortcut and transfer the property of the trade mark back under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In the last few days, you have increased the worrying statement that you will propose to your political movement + re-take over the short-term UDF, writes the Association in its letter signed 19, of which, for example, François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MODEm or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance Centre.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place the name+Nouveau centre+ on your promotional material and on the welcome website of your name+Nouveau centre+ movement, with the +UDF today+ slogan, also note the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this shortcut, explains the UDF Committee, which calls for the NC movement "to remove all mentions of the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (your) website".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over the property of the trademark to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts in order to respect the laws and legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, they shall notify the signatories.
In their letter they state that UDF 'is a full-fledged political movement in 1978 'and they remind that Mr. Morin and his friends 'chosen' to leave in 2007, 'to create a competitive movement, just like others in 2002, to set up an UMP.
The Nouveau movement therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union pour la demoncratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoD for three years and to form a committee responsible to defend the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered a trademark", he was not "a member of the UDF for three years", but of UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used the non-existent acronym to do so on his own account.
This incompetence begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then they ironically express themselves to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to speak out of an anonymity by accepting a name that we do not have the right to".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the state of weakness.
The Nanterre Court decided on Friday to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and to rule on whether he used the condition of weakness of an eighty-year-old billionaire to take part of her fortune, which was blamed by her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
Photographer (62), known for his famous photographs, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, a crime for which a maximum sentence of 3 years is imposed and a fine of EUR 375 000.
This decision confirms that there will actually be a case trial that can be referred to as the family saga of one of the richest families in France where a mother and daughter are attacking each other and fighting for the management of the beauty empire of L'Oréal.
Of course, 15. the criminal court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The heir and the main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State Prosecutor's Office in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time state whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and during which period.
I think he's going to go for it.
I'll talk to her about the matter, and after the hearing, Mrs. Bettencourt, Georges Kejman, stated.
As for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent report(...). The expert will show that he manipulated (M. Banier) with this old lady who needs protection.
It's two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter started criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-perceived artist, who she blames for taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros by gift of checks, life insurance contracts or master's paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to judge the merits of a lawsuit filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday's lawyer's court hearing changed into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters to her notary (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) expressing her distrust of her husband Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to an attorney, adds, "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years?
Ever since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The State Prosecutor’s Office in Nanterre has again found that the complainant’s conduct is not justified, even more so, that the custody judge rejected her application for legal protection for her mother on these days.
Liliane Bettencourt is completely capable of participating in the court, not being protected or in custody.
No one else will act for her," confirmed the D.A.'s representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court of First Instance finally held that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be entitled to comment at the time of the initiation of the proceedings.
The Managerial Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was unnecessary...
For more than ten years, the management behaviour of large companies against employees has been reminded of the approach of companies to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about identifying with "values" from the mountain, as before, when it was necessary for consumers to force products that came from the ideas of the head of factory technicians.
By becoming the center of business companies, the customer has compared the marketing revolution strategy of conquering the market in the right direction...Although authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, return regularly!
Passive employee access can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that affects mostly managerial casts.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI "requires all stakeholders (...) an active approach and the ability to predict" and requires employees to make commitments that are completely contrary to authoritarian management revenues.
We therefore call for a managerial revolution, which should aim to put workers at the centre of interest of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal public opinion surveys.
Internal polls of public opinion - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that, in the face of a new situation, the structure will, after various turns, return to... what she's always done!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases proportionally with the severity of its own failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of engineering colleges, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of their mental convenience, they master an old behavioral theory, now reinvigorated by "neurosciences" from the US and widely distributed without greater knowledge by scientific institutes and media.
With the ability to move the levers (sic) of the managers involved, Ipsos showed a recent survey of the agency on Figaro.fr, which only confirms the managers in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses assumes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating fundamental insight into all intentions and practices of the procedure: for employees, commitments towards the undertaking will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is addressed only by studies of the Motivating Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they assess their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doxy that enables them, through the image that tells them about the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, managers can control, predict and anticipat on their "social performances" and indicate their management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates fertile ground for the development of sound and efficient economic intelligence.
With a speech from Oslo: "Just war" Obama earned praise from the right hand side.
On Friday, the American right welcomed the speech Barack Obama gave the day before in Oslo, satisfied with the fact that the Nobel Peace Prize holder for 2009 defended the concept of "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who first mocked the award of the Obama Prize on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, the former Vice Presidential candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the music of the right-wing Republican wing, for the U.S. newspaper Today, and added that she herself expressed "sometimes necessary" wars in her memoirs, which are just coming out.
Of course, war is the last thing Americans would want to do for work, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the deployment of forces on Thursday in Oslo and used his speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Another Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the president did "very good work" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, congratulations were made by the former President of the House of Representatives, who primarily appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech quite historic, said Gingrich during the interview on the radio series "The Takeaway".
The former Member, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to see the "left-wing president" to remind the members of the Nobel Prize committee that they themselves would not be free and could not pass on the price for peace if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former author of the speeches by George W. Bush, now editor of Washington Post, Obama presented "very American speech".
Not only did he introduce himself as a "world citizen" as usual, but "he spoke as an American president" and reminded Europeans that they live in a safe bubble they did not themselves create and that they do not do too much to preserve it," Gerson said.
A few dissatisfactions from the right include the Bush era hawk, former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, who described the speech as "one-sided, bloated and without inspiration", as stated on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is terrified to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
"When the war is wrapped up in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the mid-left press has a commendable view of the President.
Although the Los Angeles Times still considers the award of the price of peace to Obama premature, it assessed its output as "excessive" even for a speaker known by his talents.
The speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression", states Californian daily.
Obama "said what was needed", evaluated the New York Times, and referred to the speech as "simple and informative".
Road carriers: three marathons to an agreement to save supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiations, the road hauliers and the TLF, the only employer's organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended the call for a strike and a threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed his "joy" after several negotiations, which began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the discussion, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning hoping that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
Even so, the three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) resigned from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting that began at 11 o'clock to be agreed and signed at 18 o'clock.
This conflict "would hurt businesses very much" and "it would be a danger that holidays would be disrupted at the end of the year", said Bussereau.
The text contains a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wages increases from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we're giving our members orders not to block, not to block supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was difficult to admit an increase in high pay due to the international competition."
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, declared CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a 'agreable compromise'.
The agreement also envisages a revalorisation of travel expenditure of 3% and a report on the state of the road transport situation in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the question of 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled "a reduction of EUR 100 million on corporate wages taxes", which was the subject of an amendment by the government to the bill on the 2009 budget, which was voted on on Thursday night at the Friday of the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a 'consistent' vote.
The signature allows for this agreement to apply first to undertakings that are members of this organisation, later to the whole sector, in the event of enlargement by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "as soon as possible," assured Bussereau.
The entire process can only slow down the disapproval of employers' organisations.
The FNTR talks about "bad trade" because EUR 100 million "has already been offered to the sector as part of the compensation for part of the carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to act in emergency, not as a result of mutual analysis, but so as not to be angry with the turkey eaters during the coming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement in the next 12 months "will bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field".
RER A suburban trains: interruption of transport at the weekend, unions dissatisfaction with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
The interruption of transport on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, as Friday's negotiations between the unions and the RATP leadership did not result in any concrete results on the premium request.
On Saturday and Sunday, i.e. the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, the trains will only be driven between 10 and 20 o'clock, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every other train, outside this section only one of the four.
The connection to SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Business houses Galeries Lafayette, which expect over 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP tried to connect with big business houses".
Line RER A leads from west to east of Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one of the two trains was in operation, and virtually no set was running at the time off the top as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France made a different arrangement and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning there were many fewer people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station than usual, among other things because students and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up about an hour and a half early to make sure he arrived on time.
Saint-Lazare Station was not overcrowded, the SNCF State Railway announced, because more officials and order guards were predicted.
RER A suburban trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or from Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the station Saint-Lazare with a metro connection.
Another general meeting of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the management, which the unions considered "weak".
RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER and urban trains on all sides, work time adjustment, career course, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who require a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (DepartmentJih).
For the time being, RATP has even postponed proposals on the premium, making CGT worse, with the fact that the management "was not able to solve the problem, while the travel carriers and SNCF could".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "the conditions for the pursuit of the profession" were further reviewed", RATP stated.
Which is why the union thinks the business is making fun of the weekend passengers.
In the morning, about 150 drivers were taken by the Business Committee at its headquarters in Paris.
Therefore, in the interest of calming down, the management, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, decided to meet.
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independent have notified an emergency strike.
The unions request a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, of which 30 euros of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Indépendants (independent)) and complain of worsening working conditions on this line, which daily carry millions of passengers.
RER suburban train drivers earn between €2200 and €2700 gross wages in advanced times and €600 to €650 in irregular working hours and on Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's justice has dissolved for the Kurdish party, and this decision has severe consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main pro-Curde party in the country. This decision immediately triggered protests in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of the government, which tries to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end the 25-year conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "the nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the President of the Supreme Court of Hasim Kilic after four days of negotiations.
The decision was adopted unanimously by 11 judges, where the majority-seven votes were required for dissolution of the party, Kiliç said and added that 37 party castors, including its President Ahmet Türk and Aysela Tugluková, were prohibited from participating in the political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (from 500).
The leadership of the Party has already pointed out before the verdict that the Members would rather leave Parliament than act as members without political authority.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Appeal Abdulrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obeying the "commands" of the Party of Workers of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political display of the rebels from PKK.
The Party shall ensure that it has no "basic connection with the PKK" but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the Government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes when the government hands a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit the support of the Kurds against the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP's leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a resumption of tensions in the south-east of Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations against the conditions under which the leader of PKK Abdullah Öcalan is detained into conflicts with the police have fallen.
Since the notification of the decision of justice, thousands of demonstrators have gathered before the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeastern part, mostly inhabited by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, demonstrators threw Molotov's cocktails again, or shot the stones from the washing machines.
About a hundred people have also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk stated that the decision of justice only "intention of despair".
Turkey cannot solve this question (Kurds, notes red.) by banning the party, it said in the press.
The government, formed by a party to the Islamic movement, also condemned this decision.
We're basically against interference.
It doesn't solve anything, said Minister of Energy Tanner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete shot off of the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course we can look forward to the response from PKK, added.
On Thursday, PKK signed up for one of the most murderous attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow can come
Pretty crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the winter department of technical services FES.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the car technology.
This could happen for the first time in the weekend according to the meteorologists.
There are over 300 employees and 120 vehicles ready to take care of the snow and ice.
At the same time, the FES proceeds according to the precise plan.
As it snows in Frankfurt all over and temperatures fall below zero, they will leave on 20 sections and the big one, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and transitways like Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, lines of suburban public transport, pedestrian zones and sections with falling as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3:00 in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to soak in wet salt within a maximum of three hours, which is better held, about 1040 kilometres.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "to make the roads available when the right starts to work."
It's not easy when it starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter department of technical services, "because no one is willing to take a place."
Only when it does not snow so much are the arrival and interconnection communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side roads and the side roads.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, footmen of the FES head off to the road, cleaning out dangerous places and crossings.
The FES can't usually take care of all the cycling routes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which follows from 22 to 4.30 mainly bridges, says Brauburger.
As the iceberg is quickly formed, the sprinklers exit as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
The police will also call them if necessary.
A college of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal's length of two metres and 1,50 metres high ran on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, bent teeth, short forearms with scratchy claws and long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing unusual.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday edition of Science magazine writes that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these physical characteristics.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial area of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa is opening a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He's been showing us a lot about related relationships, enlargements and early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, it's not seen for trias settlements, reports a member of the Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identified scientists quickly as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The find confirms the theory of the early history of the dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an unusual find: "The dinosaurus fossils from the trias are very rare, mostly only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
Especially sensational this finding is not, but confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says, for example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is usually disputed.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizards split into three most important development lines: carnivorous teropods, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, "long-legged" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores Ornithischia (birds), such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is after Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues are original therapists.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
The Tawa hallae skull, for example, found evidence of airbags, which also the offspring of birds’ teropods.
Airbags make breathing birds more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were obviously partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive teropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of huge sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, he created this useful innovation already likely a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Since so far the most primitive dinosaurs lived in South America, scientists were suggesting that lizards had first appeared there.
According to this, three development lines were divided early and spread from South America to all continents, which at that time, as a supercontinent of Pangea, formed a single earthling mass.
The fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two others, not particularly closely related teropods, would be the reason for that.
The three of them can't come from one common, emigrated forefather, scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to the group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His conjecture could put together a distorted image, because in South America there were very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs preserved, and on other continents they are rarely found ever.
As the dinosaurs have shown, from a relatively rare sideline of the reptilian species, they have evolved to rule vertebrates on earth during the Middle Ages, still remain a puzzle.
During the Triassus, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the triase, dinosaurs spread to the whole world and many new species developed, while relatives died out and the interface of the triasus and the jury.
The history of success has not lasted forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been mass extinctions that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could push out the competition.
The history of success has not lasted forever.
150 million years later, he helped the meteorite impact of another group of animals that had also evolved in the trias and had lived in the shade of mammals since.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
On the list are professors of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley, California.
Associates from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearing of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University took care of the world's riot.
278 professors and teachers of Goethe University, but also universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America solidarity with protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, "not approved" by the Presidium, the instigated police intervention.
Since the walls and works of art were stifled, University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building taken by the strikers and lecturers last week.
At the same time, five students were injured.
Damage to the case, judge the signatories, do not justify "violent dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and teaching police commando".
The clearing is an "inadmissible intervention" into the freedom of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves for "unauthorized and criminalisation of protest" and distracts attention from content.
The Presidency avoided the necessary discussion.
Speakers call for the cessation of criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikeers did not support material damage.
Sustained protest
Also young trade unions Verdi and the German trade union solidarity with students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for your own future, says the mystery of the Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Ms Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has so far defended the progress of the university president and police.
We're grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, said on Thursday in Aktuellen Stunde (current hour) in the Wiesbaden Assembly.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said a member of the Earth's House for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise the opposition factions of SPDs, Greens and Linke saw it.
The CDU takes painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of addressing the arguments and demands of the students, there was a clearance.
Linke made a proposal calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For years, it paid for a secret city, not accessible to visitors from the west.
Zenograd, one of the ten counties of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly guarded location where secret military research was carried out.
Today, this district, with 216,000 inhabitants, is considered 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, is the "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres.
Since September 2008, the Greengrad representatives have established contacts with the Frankfurt Research Centre Riedberg - university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were multiple visits and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zenograd and Ridberg the "Protokol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow’s Vice-President Yuri Rosljak and the Prefect of Zenograd Anatoly Smirnov, and was signed by the Head of Planning Officer Edwin Schwarz for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs dealing with science research will go to the seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to get caught on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian science companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The district was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist planned city" for military research.
Zenograd (a literal translation of "Green City") gained its name according to the wooded hilly landscape into which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brake
The size of Stuttgart 21 is not enough to prepare.
For project supporters, this is quite simply the 'new heart of Europe'.
Okay, S21 is more than starting a station than a monster building that will throw Baden-Württemberg's capital into desperate construction chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
The main railway stations, which ended up in the city centre, were then considered to be the 19th-century transport-technical fossils, which act as the brakes of modern rail transport, because it took enormously much time to shift locomotives from behind.
Go, stop for a minute, move on - that's how it should work.
That's why the main station is disappearing: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the railway station, which lies about halfway through the trans-European rail bus route between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that is why the slogan about the "heart of Europe".
It really starts with S21, although visions from the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves recognized that in the city of Hessen and Bavarian is almost unfunded.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, the head station no longer has problems with driving and driving.
Still: Starting with Stuttgart 21, including the new ICE line to Ulm.
Earth and municipal politicians have put it through.
Railways cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State group.
Urbanly, the project can still be excused in some way.
There will be a new urban space, which - if we believe in computer images of designers - will contain many greens.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The railway station and the construction of the line are designed for personal transport, which, typically in the 1980s, was attributed to a huge increase.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must first of all be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is much greener than road freight.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains because of the rapid climbs.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good EUR 6 billion was to be buried in Švabsko.
That's an official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion real.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other node points and narrow spots in the network.
There are 60 larger projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of an approximately 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, this route has been building at a slow pace.
We'd have to push hard here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The line through the Rhine Valley will become the throat of a bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment on the airport
The Earth government has left the Wiesbaden Assembly open if it goes against the judgment of the Court of Justice of Hesen (VGH) concerning the prohibition of night flights and will have it revised.
The CDU/FDP Coalition has instructed experts to legally assess more than 400 pages of VGH judgment, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel today justified in writing that the State would have to amend the night ban on flights in the event of construction of the planned northwest runway of Frankfurt airport.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as the Earth Government assumes, does not comply with the law on the protection of the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide before 4 January if it will request a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this delay and arrived at the government's representative in order to waive the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to the promises about the banning of night flights that she had made prior to the election.
It's bloody hard, if you can keep your word, said the head of Green Tarek Al-Wazir in a reference to the FDP electoral slogan "We hold the word".
Minister Posch rejected the excuses of Schäfer-Gümbel, and the Earth's government is trying to get to its nightly flights through "the twisting of rights and tricks".
Accurate legal control takes its time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on "fast first impression."
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His statements to ban night flights were never the same as the opposition's.
American banks repay aid
The American, crisis-shocked big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
At the same time, the Bank of America paid out a total of $45 billion (around €30 billion) from the Tarp bank rescue fund on Wednesday.
According to a report from the American CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to pay back state aid.
The Constitution thus wants to rid itself of the restrictions that took place with the acceptance of money - the limitation of bonus payments to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America got well 19 billion dollars of net money from its investors through interchangeable bonds.
She took the rest of the money from her cash register, which was filled with, among other things, trade unions.
On Wednesday night, the chief of the bank, Kenneth Lewis, specifically thanked the US taxpayer: Money injections helped us overcome the difficult times.

Quick Select
It went faster than expected.
The station introduced the successor just two weeks after the ZDF's board of directors pushed Chief Editor Nikolaus Brender out of office.
Last night, the gremium wanted to make a deal with that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital of Berlin, was the favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it, officially, so there wouldn't be a trial.
However, the role could also have been played by the fact that they did not want to harm the ZDF authorising officer Markus Schächter if this proposal had not passed on to the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs support from nine out of 14 members of the grémia.
The result of the vote was not known before the conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract for another five years with Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brender’s loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although expected.
The EU majority on the Governing Board signaled a few weeks before the elections that it did not want to confirm Brender in the office.
The resistance to the editor was organized by Hesenian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to maintain further the office of a highly esteemed editor, arguing that under Brender, the monitoring quotas for the ZDF news broadcast had fallen.
Therefore, until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was heavily criticised.
For the last time, 35 state lawyers have been involved in the debate, who consider Koch’s procedure to be unconstitutional.
It was no use.
About a person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 went Frey to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 Personal Reporter of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 Writer in Washington; 1998 Head and moderator of "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 Head of Foreign Policy of the ZDF; since then Head of the main study of the ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected as Media Magazine Journalist on Wednesday, was deposed, the Greens announced that they would bring a constitutional action.
Koch’s counter-candidacy on the Board of Directors, the Rhine-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal countries should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the staff proposals of the authorising officer could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF Supervisory Board.
Brender's supposed successor Peter Frey was ordered by the board of directors by a smart chess move - immediately after Brender was deposed for this strongly criticized by the grémium.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate him as Chief Editor without losing his face both Schächter and could have been elected by the Board of Directors without getting suspicious that the party was pushed into office.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is still ranked among leftist liberals.
The study gets rid of junk
A partial success for students: After a year of strike, the ministers of culture finally went to the federal countries on Thursday: At the conference of ministers of culture and university rectors, both parties agreed that it is willful to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the load by the tests: In principle, each study module should be terminated by one single test.
In addition, the workload of the students should be reviewed, and a 'real and defensive rate' should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of tests between universities in Germany and abroad.
The federal countries undertake to create more flexible joint structural tasks for bachelors and masters' studies.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the opening of student protests in the worm, ministers of culture and university rectors have had winged words about better study in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, they're filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board has decided that the number of tests will be drastically reduced: "Every module will usually only be completed with one test", says the 30-page report, which is intended to partially regulate the approval of study subjects.
"Substantially lower test burden," said Reinhold Grimm's chairman of the accreditation board, "to stop a misdevelopment which significantly reduced the intensity of the studio."
This is to be the "consumption of study" in the future "decisive criterion" in implementation.
The modules and content must be "hardly rechecked" so that students do not "restrict" when choosing them.
seminars".
Students should "put into space that allows and supports their own initiative".
The rules should apply when approving new fields of study, but also after reviewing existing fields of study.
These need to be "re-accredited" every five years – but this means it will continue until 2015 before all study fields are re-examined.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation boards established by the federal states.
In October, the cultural ministers called on the Land to act on the agencies so that the teaching system was not too large and the examination regime was not strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and universities have already agreed on appropriate measures by the Ministry of Earth.
As the only country so far, the Rhine-Falcko has pledged additional resources for the further development of the Bologna Process.
The money should primarily cover universities’ consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen test and foreign authorities.
That's what countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wants to amend the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
According to her, only one single test should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of the study should be even more flexible, and the recognition of tests from other universities should be guaranteed and the availability of a Master's degree should be made easier.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all study fields in the country should be reviewed.
The government and opposition were arguing again on Thursday about the country's study conditions.
In addition to praise, there was also a criticism of the resolution.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups called for education policy-making not to take place in the future "at closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
Not later than after the strike, "at least a word should speak to it" should also students as interested persons.
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of University Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need student experience", said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom HRK advised on a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: They require a legal claim that would allow every graduate with a bachelor degree to access the master’s degree.
Secondly, the Lands must ensure that, for today's generation of bachelors, there are enough places available in the Master's degree fields with the best possible study conditions, said a member of the Board of Directors of GEW Andreas Keller.
The Land must employ much more speakers.
However, ministers of culture did not comment on free access to Master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Hert Müller
Getting to and out of Germany is nice, almost no control..." is the introductory line of one poet, Werner Söllner, who, at the same time, has lost his language background in this torn-out language piece.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, he worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of one children's book publishing house, then 1982 he moved to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner was awarded with various literary prizes, 1993 he lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the Head of the Hesenian Literary Forum in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, a seminar in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts", took care of a significant non-literary start.
Söllner apparently left a statement before fellow writers of Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, confessing to cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Secure.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German language prize in 1989.
The attempts at recruiting began inconclusively, first in 1971.
I continued Söllner, "so someone who did not resist enough attempts to intimidate by the Secure."
Poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize was awarded to Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary dealings with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government is a literary scene, and in particular a community of German authors originating in Romania, was shaken by a case that refers to the depths and shamefulness of the political system, which is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the offender, but is also a victim.
Secret Agent Walter played a role in the Securities, said Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and referred to the positive influence on himself as secret agent Walter.
"He was chopping me up" at all the points for him back then," Markel says.
He has a moral duty to make this point.
Söllner's statement was in this form, and in front of this audience, an unexpected but surprising confession by the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote already in July when she read her own files, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the peaks of Secure.
The allegations, you can assume, will speculate and in some cases even know which name is behind a cover named Sorin, Voicu and just like Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, in the meantime, a very certain examination of the components of Stazi, the handling of the estate of the control of the Secure is still very differential.
In recent years, systematic education has been undermined and limited.
One of the Bifler's offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of the Components of Secure (CNSAs), was only established in 1999, the release of the act has been taking place rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law that manages the management of the components.
That the former securitate members still have a great influence in Romania, he demonstrated after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which one of the former heads of the securitate of Temešvár expressed his refusal about the winner of the award.
She said she had psychosis, after all, she was only questioned once.
The indignation of power has been expressed completely uncovered in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as in connection with the silenced offence, raises the inevitable questions.
Why now? Who is hurt? The special reaction of listeners to Söllner’s confession expects that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than the assignment of guilt and shame.
To the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturated Deposit Champions League
It looked like a purely dressed salesman came from a cute Christmas party at which the manufacturer of sports candy goods was handing out when he got on a quarter-hour after midnight to the called Mercedes class C, the new coach of the VfBr Christian Gross accompanied by an orange-colored sponsor bag.
A man with a sleazy tin had a foreign city drive him around.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in play, and drunk by luck was a 55-year-old man too little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we will continue to work.
Or it'll just start.
The words of only three days engaged by Switzerland: "We have achieved the eight-finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to the win3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: it will be a brutally hard fight against descent."
"A more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in the Moszcz in a regular league day.
And to avoid repeated obvious weaknesses after three fast goals of the Marica (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draw
The 8th Championships League (attack 16/17. + 23/24 February/ retaliatory match 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18th December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s startling successor will therefore be preserved.
Not only did he provide the supposed healer, who, in a short period of time, added confidence, willingness to deployment and joy of the game to the uncertain Stuttgart professionals.
I went to the players and I told them to focus on their strengths and I urged them to be more courageous, explained the Gross soul healer so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, however, did not prove any more effective with the intervention of the therapist Babbel.
He blew up some magic, admitted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedir, who, after a long-term break caused by the injury, became, thanks to his dynamism, the best player on the field, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new supervisor: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
It was obviously missing Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns the sports president Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, even players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened spare and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won even in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after the 0:4 defeat in Leverkusen, considering Khedir.
And Sport President Horst Heldt recalled that although one goal had been achieved in the season, the other one was far away.
We're not through yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday after his first home victory after three months was caused by weekend events that freshly came to life in the form of a television interview with goalie Jens Lehmann just before the game began.
There are decisions that others and not Jens have made, and Heldt has responded to the hard criticism of Lehmann.
He threw the board of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the pressure of puberty fans.
Even the fact that he was cancelled his free day after the games, called Lehmann a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "formulates pure egoism", replied Heldt and announced the consequences for goalkeepers.
Both 40s won't be happy for life anymore.
In any case, they are one with the others, that without the work of a sedated coaching team, it would not be possible to perform so much in a player's power and combat performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share of success", say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man agrees with the plastic bag.
The Battle of the Heavyweight World Championship
A passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world champion Vitali Klitička.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainians defended their title in the heavyweight of the WBC boxing organisation.
The referee's statement was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitčko remains the world champion in heavyweight boxing.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated Kevin Johnson on Saturday night on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitička it is the third successful defence of the title after its return in October 2008.
Before that, Ukrainian was twice WBO and WBC World Champion.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to the.o. that everyone was expecting.
Click upgraded his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice defeated for injuries.
The challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th duel.
Before about 17.000 viewers in the Bern arena, he drove a 2.02 m high Klitčko battle mainly with his left hand.
An 11 cm smaller Johnson, who announced the end of the Klitčko era before the duel, was withdrawing from the strike of the world champion, so that Klitčko could not plant a decisive strike with his dangerous right hand.
Pretty much what passive Johnson did on the challenger pretty little and he was just trying to get into the next laps.
Although the clicker provoked words and gestures, his hits were rarely struck by the world champion.
Still, it's only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klickie full of 12 laps.
The challenger took care of the riot in the Swiss capital before the duel.
He insulted Klitschka as a "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything properly."
During the Friday season, the champion got provoked, pulled sunglasses off Johnson's nose, "so he could see his eyes".
Fourth victory after Clitschka's return
The cliché remained undefeated even after the fourth battle after its return on 11 October 2008.
After almost a four-year break, he defeated Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to give up without a fight before.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreol from the USA in defence.
In this fight, I only got one punch, and physically I was in good shape, justified Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimír is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt, however, is worn by the British David Haye after taking down Nikolay Vulajevo from the throne in November.
Haye said he had a fight against Klitschk this summer, which was scheduled for September.
He's supposedly planning his promoter's fight against Klick at the Wembley Stadium in London.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: The head of the faction of the Green Jürgen Trittin called the Minister of Defense Guttenberg a liar for misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Linke (Levice) invite the Chancellor to explain.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz air raid, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed conscious deception.
The Minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "consciously false", said the head of the faction of the Green Jürgen Trittin in the Saturday news show ARD "Tageschau".
Let's call it the usual term: he lied.
The order for killing was issued when disregarding the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the essence of the report that NATO, which Mr. Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
It turned out on Friday that the attack was not just about destroying kidnapped trucks, but about targeting two Taliban leaders.
In an American air raid requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, there were up to 142 people killed or injured according to NATO's investigation.
Green, SPD and Linke called on the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to immediately express herself before the Federal Chamber and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel needs to explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan Federal Parliament's policy - and, if the Chancellor's Office, Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, they called on Jürgen Trittin and a colleague from the Green Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm has certainly rejected criticism.
The Chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry's background for the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneider and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from Spiegel, the two Guttenberg were informed correctly and completely about the background of the attack on tanks.
Officially, it was said that they were to deny the existence of NATO reports and silence the sensitive details of the Minister.
However, from the vicinity of the two senior officials, it was said that the Ministry of Defence even warned on several reports, among them on a two-page document commanding Colonel Klein and on one report from the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had in the meantime asked in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any reply so far.
The Ministry did not comment on the comments on Saturday and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the Federal Chamber of Inquiry Committee, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some people see images in their wake and hear voices that others do not see and hear.
Not only are mental illness or drug addictions intertwine the lines between imagination and reality.
As long as that happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can surround ourselves with wildest ideas and fantasy delusions.
But those who experience dream situations in their wake, see and hear things that others do not see and hear, usually pay in the Western world for a fool or drug addict, or at least as a freak.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the case of mentally ill or in drug addiction.
Guilty has our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels will ensure that the boundaries between dream, imagination and reality are brought together.
Dreams of a changed state of consciousness can occur in various forms, in a better way we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the vision of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the Prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, shaman states of delusion, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise if the balance of neural brain transmitters occurs - mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between delusion and dream has employed philosophers and doctors since the ancients.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of a dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, observed in 1861 "a great similarity of delusion with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, deception of senses".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and screechingly colored.
Gravity has no power over it, floating by the ceiling of the room.
Feels a kick.
Behind him winged black figures with bloody red grimas, precious teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fire shoes, throw him against the wall, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand the voices that he's been given and insulted.
Henning T. pulls two wires out of the stereo, hooks them up in the loop and fixs it up on the hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one speaker and loops around his neck.
Jumps.
The loop permits.
Learn, the voices of the congregation roaring out the drums, "Go to the clinic and be cured!"
Today henning T. 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
LSD's been activated.
His diagnosis is schizo-infective paranoid psychosis, and besides, he's manic-depressive, he's taking anti-depression drugs, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, three years married.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubt, says he.
Ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is after the depression of the second most commonly treated disease.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the disabled can no longer distinguish between the internal and the outside world, they get into a reawakened state that can lead to hallucinations, sized, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Especially widespread is the hearing of votes - voices that command, comment or lead dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not unusual.
The disabled is unable to distinguish between important and irrelevant, the brain cannot filter out disruptive signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens up to floods of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, the Chief Doctor of the Clinic of General Psychology of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is located in the center of the event, everything has meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events, and he cannot actively form them.
Therefore, Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparing with reality is not usually possible in them, the ghosts are a terrible reality, the awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime, experience a hallucination
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "but remains the sensual and spatial structure of the reality that one perceives in psychosis, essentially preserved."
Deceptive thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality and alienation takes place within a real framework.
A scientist is still in front of a puzzle why our brain is doing this kind of thing.
Exceptional states can lead to a short-term loss of relation to reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone develops into psychosis.
It seems that there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that the affected have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development, neuronal brain maturation, such as maternal viral diseases during pregnancy, will be damaged, explains Fuchs.
But she remains a riddle as to how the neural system is broken, which has not shown up for many years.
The roles are also played by the influences of the surroundings - stress or traumatic experiences can be an initiator of psychosis if there is a disposition with it.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
♪ When our brains boil ♪
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallow expensive medicines, others give money for drugs to get them, says the professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we view delusions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often only a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and overcrowdings for ten years, and last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Real World in Our Head).
The hallucinations are one of the typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also a surprising number of other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma.
Surprisingly hallucinates the brain of a healthy person under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of ideas that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are too active or little suppressed; if our brain boils or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of stimuli, stress, concern with love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to a third of the respondents reported that they had hallucinated at least once in their life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Foreign Pomeranian and attends a high school there.
It's a perfectly normal girl, actually.
If there weren't any pictures and voices.
At breaks, she may be approached by a collage with long, dark hair.
When he answers, her classmates look at her with a surprise - no one but her can see and hear this boy.
This shy girl thinks of an uptight dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't eat, she knows.
He's awake, hearing and seeing the boy, just like he hears and sees a girl sitting next to him in a bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It feels good, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are rather daunting.
Often delusions are loads.
When she sits in a classroom, she can't watch the teaching, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just introducing a new classmate, while he explains to everyone else what she can hear and see on the table of mathematical equations.
At night, appearances are rather depressing.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, she can't often tell whether she's awake or asleep, whether the paintings she sees, grimasy, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and legs arise before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, screaming at those characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009, Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She did her graduation last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist Kasten online, she knows she hasn't gone mad.
The delusions are also the art of despair
If someone's socially isolated or stimuli are taken from him, he'll most likely have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I don't think the brain has enough employment and takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, was scared of other kids as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that a man she calls her father from when she thinks she's not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that also process real sensations and sounds, it is difficult for disabled people like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "it takes place in the brain, also reality is displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to develop, therefore it seems so real."
It also evaluates Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people is not significantly different from the hallucination in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, people are mentally able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to assess hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between sleep and hallucination
Unfortunately, the imaginary experience in our world is mostly pathologicalised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and head of the Psychic and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, agonizing disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - a delusion is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oneiroid form of experiences, a special form of altered consciousness to sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that they consider to be real and cannot even distinguish them from the awake.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience full consciousness of motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and by himself, such as a lasting, complete inability to move, he replaces life threatening the real situation with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of borderline between sleep and hallucination.
Because it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will become present.
An intensive form of supporting senses and shifting senses into an insufferable situation that allows people their own ability to form, to move on to the loss of consciousness within a moment.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of Heart) as the soul's rescue action.
He was 49 years old when, after surgery of the heart valve with a subsequent heart transplant, his consciousness was released on a several-day journey, while his body was still in the intensive care unit.
Claussen was immersed in the world he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man tied to a bed, in a train sanatorium, the robot keeps him healthy.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobles who make the narcotics of blood.
On a motorcycle, a Greek takes him to his country, surfs on a hospital bed in the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
It sinks completely into imaginary events, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
A dream is a different state, describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys after years and in irrelevant details are clearly clear.
Even clearer and more intense than a real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, the oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug connections show how fragile our internal images of the external reality are even in the watchful state.
Every change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
At 27, children are to be taken over by the publishing house
The new head of Kallen publishing house is a transitional solution: For a long time Hubert Burda wants to hand his business over to his two children, he told Spiegel.
Holding is to belong to a 100 percent family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business for a long time in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at 27 years of age and have a firm will to enter the business, says 69-year-old Spiegel.
We've dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is then asked.
The question is, do they have the powers to do it?
It is not possible to put their children at the forefront of 7,500 employees if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both children and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he has withdrawn from the Presidency of the Board since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board of directors at Burdy since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury section, responsibility for the company's assets was added and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's resignation also Direct marketing, Foreigner, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the members of the family is at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen's name is also used to "overrun 10, 15 years," Burd said.
Holding should belong to a 100 percent family in the future, says Burda.
In view of the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that even family businesses were not sure of their demise: "It always affected companies that had been infected with the desire for capital that they had speculated and thought that they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He's never had a dream of world power, Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political precursor to this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the World League with the "Time", these deals are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming, and it's a time when it's appropriate to find out what celebrities are wearing, and to adapt to it your celebratory wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which must be noted.
We're making a few proposals.
The singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric motor
The energy company Endesa, together with Barcelona City Hall, founded the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE’ (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will establish and manage a travel plan for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensure agreements in the field of mobility, deal with, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport for the future.
3 'Electric cities'
Barcelona, however, is not the only city involved in the project for the introduction of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will join the project as well.
These are the three cities that the government has chosen under the MOVEL Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
The energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support activities in the field of research and technological development in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with the participation of Endesa in the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects e.g.G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a period of peace in the automotive industry.
The Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is "a peaceful period".
In the 2009 Prime Minister’s economic report, Zapatero summarised the measures introduced during the year in support of the automotive sector.
"Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would now be expecting a state of desertion, the closure of some of our main manufacturing companies," said the Prime Minister.
"Thanks to this plan and the wishes of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a period of peace for this industry is expected in the future, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he noted that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Car Plan (PIA), has identified 800 million for projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies that mobilised an investment of more than 3 billion Eur.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment was intended to develop new models, to modernise production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government measures to support the requirement and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President, this plan made it possible to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and to ensure a "significant increase" of the entries, namely in November by "40%".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Car Salon will be opened in Madrid, which is the space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the world of motors.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Madrid’s Casa de Campo glass pavilion.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, with more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors.
Here you can find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid products of all types related to the world of motors.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious.
Among the companies involved will be the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Clasicos, a specialized Mercedes Benz company.
Exterior competence tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: concentration, sports performances, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Eligibility tests will also be carried out for classic cars and motorcycles in an adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintenance of sport style
Mazda intends to show that being gentle about the environment has no negative impact on sport style.
And that's why Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system - also baptized as a jako-Stop-, which is a device that is currently only available with a 2.0 150 horsepower engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle execution, population, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent for Mazda3.
The front seats including driver seats have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely delicate.
Using the toolbox and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda is continuing the Japanese trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us partly of a style that also presents Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, a large luggage area and regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic engine stop and start system is available only with a two-litre petrol engine and 150 horsepower and a six-speed hand transmission.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very delicate, characterized by reduced noise levels, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive as many kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is characterized by greater comfort in driving and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version chosen for testing is called Sportive and includes more serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, mention the lane tracking system (RVM), which prevents the emergence of a dead angle, the control of draw and stability, speed control, inside mirror sensitive to light, on-board computer with a large screen, parking sensors, independent air-conditioning, rain sensor and lights, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels made of 17-inch alloy.
And if the equipment wasn't enough, this version was equipped with a Pack Premium, with a surcharge of 1,500 euros: adaptive two-xenon light and a BOSE sound system with a CD holder, other than the other parts.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is characterized by the quality of materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
Furthermore, people who do not drive more kilometres a year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a petrol engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is €21.770 for the implementation of Luxury and €23.270 for the tested version -Sporive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a large dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L.A. has a red carpet, soft like the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the brand'Nine.
Our 'pe', extravagant as usual, chose dark 'males'.
Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is only used to view the mail, without the possibility of viewing certain types of attachments or surfing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time appreciated him as one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see him out there, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payment, less than half of the amount paid for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started offering two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other is based on a permanently provided free data service, but it is necessary to pay a six-fold amount for Peek.
The FonPeek, which was introduced yesterday at the Le Web event, is a European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It's as limited as his American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly price for maintenance is around 12 euros per month and includes roaming all over Europe.
People who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or to look impatiently for a cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection) so that they can see the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a doctorate from physics to understand them, as well as very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and consider various offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering to download books and other search on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and paid at purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen in the case of FonPeek one day, it's the possibility of buying with a permanent approach like Peek already established in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it's the best type for the consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could also be used on the computer.
The color Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady in the United States.
For Barack Obama's appearance as President of the United States, she chose dress and coat in this color, and she also chose the same color when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: handing over the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellowish green with shiny effects- in both cases it was a three-piece set - dress, bag and coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embellishment or collar.
At first glance, the first lady of the United States seemed to have decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturias princess and wear similar clothes.
The substance from which the clothing is made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of her entry into the post Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with printing.
It changes also accessories: green shoes with medium heel, now similar model, but in gold color.
He wears a variety of hairstyles: this timedrdol, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems with their motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in women of younger age who wish to acquire a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and Working Career of Spanish Women' carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Women's Institute.
The study was attended by 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities on the labour market due to motherhood.
The study stresses that at the beginning of the partnership there are many differences in views on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home work part-time or have no stable work, start living with their partner early, having their first child and having more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnering and motherhood delay, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have an average of 3.7 years of age since their relationship with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted much of their lives to their stable employment and have therefore had to postpone their coexistence and the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong impact on motherhood, although less influence on the time of coexistence with the partner", explains Margarita Delgado, who is devoted to research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of the child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
Differences are also between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35-49 years, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child aged 25.1 or 32.1 years.
"There is yet another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with basic education are married and have their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education have the opposite priority of getting a stable job, before marriage and the birth of the first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Cause I'm worth it'.
The director of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant international actresses, is thus added to other famous L'Oréal Paris personalities such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, Evangeline Lilly ('lost') and Freida Pinto ('millionaire') entered this selected club.
The male part of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by important personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's Partner in the 'Lost'.
British Fashion Prices
The British have a lot to talk about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, earlier and now - met at the annual award of the prizes held in London, at theRoyal Court os Justice.
No one's missed a meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen the best model of the year.
Poker by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases also in everyday life).
It does not do so in fearful and predictable genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but it seeks something similar to the core of creative personality.
The journey brings excitement, and the Vicent does not spare healing or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading experience, even at repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "I found on the pages of this book that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but the spiritual impulse, almost physical, just like what I feel, but it cannot be called: the benefit of anti-suicide, morals without guilt, and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been preceded by passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and regret, which is the spiritual privilege of reaching heaven by means of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssea published in Paris in 1922 Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousand peaks in universal literature, which must be overcome from the north, from which the best climbers often collapse."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He used to say about himself that he was the heir to the county, that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, these were great dreams."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on a bridge a mad cry of this man from Munich to bring his echoes to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, fleeing from himself and calling into the future and talking loudly to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled and prayed: "My God, my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave, the Spenser verses were engraved: 'After effort comes the dream, after the storm a quiet port, after the war rest, after the full life of death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In his luggage he also carried his depression.
The husband completely agreed to tell him that Eduard VII had followed her between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pia Baroja: "What else was it about for Martín Santos to focus Joyce on Baroja?
What else was it about for Beneto to have Baroness executed by Faulkner's weapons?
What else was it about to make Celus famous at the expense of the glory of the man?"
Coward aggression
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed past and our dog, a crusader saved from a shelter with a maximum weight of six kilograms, without a word they kicked him twice and seriously injured him.
Our indignation is even greater because we see nothing fun in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was also on the lead.
And in addition, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she faced these individuals on a walk, she began to worry about her own safety, for such a demon-obsessed person who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than he is himself.
It happened at five o'clock on Tuesday, usually in a quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the nearest commissioners, but we doubt that it was useful, and that we do not raise sensitive questions, we say that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationalities.
Indignation has made us declare this fact.
We don't understand what happens to youth today when they're having fun by hurting a defenseless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't understand where right manners have gone, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using helmets
The producer of Michelin tyres, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both of them have been informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of the use of helmets, as it is the only means to prevent head injury or death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of their transport safety obligations, which means "more than designing and producing even safer products", and confirmed that they are trying to achieve this purpose in other ways, i.e. in the form of instruction and information campaigns.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets while riding on a motorcycle, under the password 'To be or not to be', is the first phase when more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be placed up to become aware of the widest public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that the transport safety "is a constant problem" of this company, which is a tyre manufacturer for two-wheel vehicles, whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are being increased
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to recover.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 months of permanent bankruptcy, according to the figures of the patronizing organisation of Anfac producers and Ganvam sellers.
However, the positive figure is better to quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and represents a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling under the category of light commercial vehicles: car derivatives, pick ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/carriages.
And the clouds that most damage demand did not disappear, even if private individuals bought it, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies, and in almost 100% of cases it is funding through third parties.
Other factors such as cessation of activity or continuation of a bad economic situation should also be added to the constraints resulting from the closure of the bank credit source.
In a given situation, unlike passenger cars, the promotion of the 2000E purchase did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention those who operate on a business sheet of small and medium-sized enterprises who intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam they again reminded that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial cars (stones and buses).
The association of sellers assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to the calculations of sales of passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The hand-brake auxiliary system is already mandatory.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system it will also be with the management of the stability of the ESP, helpful hand-brake systems, all of this will become mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others a deadline is set to remedy the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measures put in place in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians by helping to prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary hand-brake system increases the brake pressure in an emergency, which the system finds after the driver has pushed down.
But not always able to hold this pressure to the end.
According to a study by the manufacturer of Bosch car parts, a third of the drivers who have an accident did not push the brakes before the collision and half of them did not use the full brake force.
Up to 1100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum braking system, reducing the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 pedestrian-related fatal accidents could be avoided annually.
The reduction of this number will be even more noticeable-for calculations would prevent one of four accidents with an impact on the person-after the introduction of the so-called intelligent hand brake systems.
In this case, vehicles will be equipped with a system that (with radar or camera) captures obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the precipitation cannot be prevented, the device will act as closely as possible on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably on 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that every item of the plan is first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, can be issued late in 2010.
On the contrary, GM ensures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken on these days.
No wonder the Swedish Government increased the pressure on US producers to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of these could be Geely, who also wishes to get a Volvo, but is considering the possibility of a Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, who operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the absence of any agreement with any of them, GM could sell certain Saab assets to Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year shall continue to apply unless it is sold.
Driving a Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, the engineers of Porsche used Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, thus the weight shows only1.275 kg.
On the basis of the first, the automatic pull-off roof was in a hand-controlled canvas design, reducing the weight by 21 kg; on top of that, aluminium doors such as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; removal of air-conditioning, 13; reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a reduction of 7 kg; on the installation of sports seats another 12 kg, lightened by 19 inches further five kilograms.
Finally, removing the audio system CDR-30 is another six kilograms less and replacing the door handles with textile handles is another kilogram.
It is also available with a dual-connected PDK transmission, one vehicle has been tested with a hand-ordered six-speed box, mainly on roads of the second class in California, on mountain stretches with many complex turns.
Its behavior can only be classified as untouchable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the asphalt vehicle is not printed.
On the contrary, for a long time we have not tested such a small and light model, which at the same time would also carry such safety when moving in a corner, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete able to warm up the muscles while driving for a short time until we order him sprint, braking, and re-use of the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the steering, which is as communicative as the exact one, whatever we're suggesting with our hands on the wheel, is what the car is going to do.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Engine sound by will
The sound of the V6 boxer, of 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be strengthened by the 'sport' option and through a system that modifys the sound of the engine that has previously been used by Panamery.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recuperation.
The curtains are fixed but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt road we're driving through with Boxster Spyder has been pretty damaged, but the car's got a good handle.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; while we met at some turns at dawn at frost and gravel even in an advanced morning.
Ultimately this ultralight car is one of the funniest in the market since it is a little more than just a modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of €70.831.
'Bag Girl'
A friend of Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocon series and an occasional 'starlette' on the 'company' shows, a singer shows his face to a bad girl as vehemently as his Chanel purses.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basconia has given herself a victory in Israel
The cashier gained a brilliant victory in 82-91 while hosting on the complicated field of Maccabi Electra, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and this is how she became the head of her group after a big performance by Mirzy Teletovice, who with eight triple points was announced the best in the team (29 reviews).
Vitoria was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mica with a large amount of deployment and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the great accuracy of the circle with 16 triple points participated a lot in the final triumph.
The game began with a front for the blue team who from the beginning stood on the mark.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, already indicated that they had attacked the Israeli cooperative very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Avalanche team decided to play Barac and Eliyah's work, which was accepted by whistling and applause when returning to its original location to increase the advantage before the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already showing up as the best in his team with 13 points, although the 'no six' at Splitter's evaluation indicated that it would not be the best night for the Brazilians.
But even though the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the smallest and the Makabas wanted to remind Vitoria that on their field everyone did not win, and 'the hand of Elías' they could win.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to the yellow return to the sun (50-49).
More inappropriate
Members of Ivanovic, injured but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to gain their breath, and the Mirza Teletovic machine gun appeared, which, with the help of English and Ribase, returned the score to a calming number (54-67), reaching the local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Alavští slurped their skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to lose their deserved results for the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter voted out for foul seIvanovic did not rush and defend well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Wounds make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left him the leadership of Group B in Euroliza in the match, which was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but mainly by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team did not fear the surroundings of the Hall of Peace and Friendship, perhaps one of the more ill in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defenses and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio, lit up the playground with 12-18, one minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity ofUnicaja , although an arsenal of locals in an internal game with Bourousus, Vujcice and Schortsanitis, he turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the U.S. resistance from Beverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to work and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to Joel Freeland's injury and three personal errors by Carlos Jiménez burdened Unicaja
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian wing of Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible Retribution
The third part was very offensive by Olympiacos, who, despite losing by 19, proved the advantage and even managed to compensate for the difference in the Malaga 66-48 match, minute 27, which shaken the lead in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured at the last game.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja’s leadership and triple points, Cook and Lewis’ contribution left a certain hope for winning 66-57, a minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because the Olympiacos proved unstoppable because of the reinforcement and excess in centimetres in his zone.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to balance the basset average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja sled and handed over the leadership of Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit application, search engines with the highest number of classified ads in the real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
Tool How much should you take? calculates users' salaries based on more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain using a form available on Facebook, where you need to put your profession, years of experience, age and city where you wish to work.
During the week of the application's operation, the search engine found that a Spanish worker generally "feels poorly rewarded", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the Trovit product.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes EUR 45.226 per year and EUR 31.059, while the Spanish receives EUR 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of EUR 34.247 net per year in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid waiter’s job in Spain is EUR 11592 a year, followed by a seller with EUR 14.725 and a worker with EUR 15.667.
The most wanted jobs on the network in the last three months are drivers, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil has set the date of Zelay's departure
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at its embassy in Tehran.
The deposed President must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate is officially terminated.
Francisco Catunda, the chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the city of Honda, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he has to leave the embassy by this date, where he has been hiding since September 21st.
"He is aware that on 27 January, after the end of his term of office, he must leave and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the specified deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya stated by telephone.
After the election of 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that it would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he attempted to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed because Zelaya refused the condition of political asylum, which was attempted to impose on him by the government of "de facto" chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented a dominant mood in the markets, again there was uncertainty on the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in an environment where directors take decisions on a future that is uncertain in itself.
The drug used by the central banks for market stabilisation was debt money through direct acquisition of assets and indirect release of liquidity at close-to-nose exchange rate, so that financial institutions could purchase assets to deduct.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have almost ended, and without questioning their disparate liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a little sand into the circle, as the Spanish central bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are participating in a return to a reduction in risk revenues.
Exchange movements and differences in bonds have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise private risks, which again affected public debt.
Once again, the pressure is on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have become a haven for the investors chosen, which has extended the differentiation of the euro area countries towards Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened to re-examine the reduction of the Kingdom of Spain's qualifications.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useful for the silence of moral risk advocates who have tried again to burden the conscience of those responsible for world economic policy with a view to blocking the devastating consequences of restricting credit to employment when, in fact, a new Thanksgiving day would have to be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emires for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that covers deficits, elections, and a new government enters.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconim and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
There is no point in saving Hungary from non-fulfilling foreign payments at the beginning of the year and in allowing the euro member countries not to fulfil their obligations.
But what makes sense is that Ecofin forces the Greek Government to transparency and commitment its own citizens to shared responsibility when it comes to the need for exceptional measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves before the period of normalisation of the transitional risk premium, some of the excesses in the supported positions would be expected.
In a Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as European companies' bonds, we do not have to worry.
If the European differences fall and our differences continue to expand, it would be typically a Spanish risk.
When our leading indicators force most of the services of studies to prejudge their recovery scenarios and review their 2011 growth scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not give the Spanish economy much hope to live up to this warning.
It looks like it's going to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets again, although for now, "be careful, buddy driver."

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene in front of the subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain is currently under discussion in the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by a speech by President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villasecy, Galán gave the press a few comments on the proposal submitted by the Subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and another EUR 60,000 million from that date until 2030 if the nuclear power plants that are currently in operation are being maintained.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95.000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola considers that investments must focus in the next decade not on increasing production capacity but on distribution networks and international connections.
The issue has changed since 2020 and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, he believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supportive energy".
Galán, who believes that the proposal for a law on sustainable economics, which has just been approved by the government, corresponds to the line requested by the company, did not want to let live as a royal decree in support of the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his opinion, "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "accuracy" of the measures, as President Iberdrol called them.
Whatever the case, Galán considers that investment decisions, although long-term, must start to take place now, because their maturation persists and a stable tax framework is needed for their initiation.
Ferrovial won 'trading' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport land services, Swiss Swissport, will play the role of the preferential partner of the Irish airlines Aero Lingus for cost services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet reached economic terms, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a cooperation protocol to create a Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The association expects an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% are Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be energy efficiency research at motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for her first concession on the highway in Australia, a market where she already works as an energy and water company.
The construction is estimated at $1,700 million (about €1,047 million).
Its competitors are the French business Bouygues and the German business Hochtief.
The 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest opportunity for Accion to be established in this country as a construction and concession highway company.
Town Hall wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initials in English) for further development of the project in a business plan secured by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
Offers are expected to be submitted in May, and the expected investment is expected to reach $1,700 million (EUR 1.047 million) and three companies with significant presence in European buildings in the last stage.
The Transcity Group is led by Accion, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second is one of the largest European underground construction specialists.
Against Accion Group there is the Northern Direct Group with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which passed through the sieve, has the name LBRJV and is involved in it by the Australian capital Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented by the ACS), also by the local Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a significant company specialising in civil constructions Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large constructions and privatisations, but it brings with it a clear difficulty of entering in a way other than the middle acquisition of a local construction company.
In addition to Asian references, the strategy followed by the above-mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Million-dollar assets
Accion is betting on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activities of the energy supplier and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and manage the desalination plant in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the construction and infrastructure areas.
The underground route subject to a toll promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority, called Northern Link (north link), is to combine the Western motorway from Toowong with the route in Kelvin Grove (see map) in the length of 5 kilometres of the tunnel. It is the largest action to reduce the transport congestion of Brisbane.
The calendar set up by the local administration plans to enter for the summer of 2010 and start work for the December of next year.
Although this paid passage would have been opened in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the work is planned until 2016.
The tunnel started in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (€308 million) for its financing.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia is still making a significant profit, as it announced yesterday a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The ACS shall operate through its local Leighton network infrastructure through a wide-band national network with optical fibre cable.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left King George Tower construction project on 27 floors in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work was only supposed to start and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In Great Britain, specifically in Manchester, will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC was allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine branch, acquired a EUR 64.5 million tunnel construction assignment for the Slovenia motorway.
The company received a contract a few days after the completion of its work on the extension of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, the Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore got an ad in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services to Sra over the last two years. Rushmore for an approximate amount of EUR 3 million a year, informed the railway company.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected among the 16 agencies that presented themselves in a competition written by Renfe, four of which took place in the finals, among them TBWA , which was responsible for creating advertising over the last three years.
From this moment on, Sra. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of campaigns.
Penalty 63 million for France Télécom for braking competition
The Competitive Regulatory Authority in France imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anticompetitive behaviour in Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes with consumers at the edge of regulation.
By this sanction, the former French monopoly and still the state company has purchased more than € 560 million of fines since 1994, imposing obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the authority which oversees competition considers that France Télécom committed a similar offence as in the past and that there was therefore a recurrence.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened online application trade in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, the Orange app trade will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry to other countries such as Spain.
The Champions League has brought in 476.4 million Madrid and Barçe from the beginning
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its establishment in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476.4 million since, which makes them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The paper's headed by Manchester United.
The paper's headed by Manchester United.
The UEFA Champions League won't just bring glory. It's also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided EUR 5.362.5 million between 105 teams (of which 12 were Spanish), which participated in this event since the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money it won for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan who won three prizes.
The Catalan contemporary champion and the last winner of the Europe Cup in 1992 is the fifth.
The list is run by Manchester United and the Munich Bayern, two teams who, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Liza of Champions.
Even though she lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is up to the third country that has won the most money through the Champions, although it has won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seeming paradox is explained by the complicated procedure used by UEFA in the distribution of money.
For this financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to make $1,090 million for the Champions League.
UEFA spends 413.1 million of this money on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the pre-classification round (including the other Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, in addition to a further EUR 550,000 for each match they participated in.
There is also a prize for winning (EUR 800,000) and for a draw (EUR 400,000 for each team).
Each of the last four gets $4 million.
The champion will make 9 million while the second finalist 5.2 million.
In this way, the club will make a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Supercup in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments for which 337,8 million are earmarked.
This money shall be divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned seats.
The champion from last year gets 40% of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group published yesterday details of the offer to purchase shares with which it wants to gain a peak position between 25% and 29.9% of the Sos capital.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public tender for the acquisition of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which it would pay at 10 years and would pay interest for this deferral1% per year.
Yesterday the Sos shares ended trading at EUR 1,85; hence Nueva Rumasa’s offer evaluates the company by 18% below the market value.
According to Nuev Rumas, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real value of the Sos.
The offer shall be conditional upon the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the share.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateo confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would be 611.7 million, while the capitalization of the Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, the sauce further changes the structure of its management.
As an attempt to stay on the fringe of possible offers for the purchase and settlement of judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, Jesús and Jaime Salazar, the election of María Luisa Jorda was announced as head of internal audit.
This decision makes her the first woman to take a high role in the food business.
It's a newly created place that will be directly subject to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from polemics because the company is still immersed in a legal battle for an alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the companies of the Salazar brothers.
De facto, there is no way that in the coming months the sauce will reveal new transfers of funds
As regards the Salazar credit, the former members of the Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified yesterday at the National Court and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV allows the option of excluding Patternina, which was involved in Inversor Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorised the exclusion of Inversor Mer against Federic Pattern on 9 October.
The supervisory authority has explained that it authorises this operation because it understands that its conditions correspond to the applicable standards and considers that the content of the explanatory brochures submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December is "sufficiency".
CNMV specified that the offer was aimed at obtaining 550.008 shares of Federica Patternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, consisting of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on the markets in Madrid and Bilbau.
It further explained that 5.592.778 million shares were immobilised and could not be transferred in any way until a tender was concluded which specified that the price had been determined by the Federation Patternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for car valuation
In these days, storms and accidents make not only car service.
Each day, thousands of cars who have suffered an insurance event are taken to the service where the expert must estimate the damage and the cost of repair.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of the parts and the working time can be long and complex work.
It may take two or three hours to calculate the repair costs from EUR 20,000 to EUR 30,000, including parts and workforce.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this kind of system.
Service providers and solutions for the estimation of insurance and maintenance events shall be dedicated to collecting information which manufacturers provide them with to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the U.S. Solera group is a leading company; 80% of the rating is done with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of valuation tools and the development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, 63 producers and importers work in Spain and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing as more versions, variants and motor solutions have been presented in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
Once a new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start working.
This is a very hot work, because it is necessary to catalogue each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out for each model, where it is possible to "displace" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As for the minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
On a mobile park in circulation, 99% exceed.
The Audatex databases have eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters are in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million a year in the development of these databases.
Each month 2.5 million data are included and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this vast information stream enables businesses to make different use and supply of different products.
The most common uses focus on repairs and maintenance, but according to individual countries there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide on the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but it does in the United States.
With regard to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain support that professionals in the sector can benefit from.
This company offers ten different tools, with AudaPlus, the standard solution for the valuation of insurance events for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it shall include the time to be estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This instrument is valid according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it little, up to 10 times a month.
Then every insurance undertaking that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass concentrates on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service for the professional sector on the Internet, which allows to disable vehicles with the overall insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, for conducting geodemographic analyses or for detecting deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a specific brand have gone through service due to an accident or how much serious insurance events have suffered during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of instrument.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group established in 1971 as a provider of services and a solution to the assessment of damage, accident or maintenance of cars
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in the service, 3,500 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover volume increased by 20% per year over the last three years, and in 2008 they charged EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalising the installation of an office in Paris began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's resources, 62% of her brother is established in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global billing of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will make EUR 19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group stood at $1,000 million stock exchange, and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2.4 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after the insurance event.
The operation anticipated a subscription of €59.5 million of 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year by 15%.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sales service is exclusively guaranteed to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, spare parts sales and professional sellers, who have to register before the start of operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 are in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered dealers and 4,000 experts.
Manages 3,000 daily ads and the Spanish market adds about 100 new ads every day.
According to the Spanish Act, a car whose chassis number has been disabled cannot return to service but can be used as a source of spare parts which have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be allowed to operate, although they have been excluded, after a preliminary procedure.
Service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user will only receive the budget in four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for a spare part, budget creation and budget generation.
Easiness of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of older professionals, who are more or less lagging in the use of new driving techniques.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles, including tourist 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Naturally, you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired using the chassis number, the real graphic view of the model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the labour force, surcharges or discounts, and then print and pass on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this workshop tool is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working on making this display three-dimensional.
This is the innovation that mechanics welcome because it allows, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner side.
