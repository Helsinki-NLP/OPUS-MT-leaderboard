Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear that they will be called muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly, the Constituent is the result of the proposal to change their title to members of the Welsh Parliament.
The idea was created in connection with the plans to transform the assembly into a Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of mockery.
One of the parliamentarians in the Labour Party expressed concerns about his group, saying that the new name rhymes with Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh the word "twp" means a fool, and the word "pwp" means a feces.
One of Plaid Cymru’s politicians stated that its grouping was “unsatisfying” with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was "open" to a name change, but he pointed out that the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh word "w" is similar to the letter "u" in the English dialect Yorkshire.
As part of the Assembly, the committee which is currently working on a bill amending the name took the following position: "The final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will be their own".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposal, and the change of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament received broad support.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of members of the Assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP in English, although the abbreviation "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among society.
Members of the Assembly are proposing alternative solutions. The difficulties of reaching a consensus are a nuisance for Elin Jones, president of the assembly, who should present the draft law in the coming weeks.
The law introducing reforms will also take into account other changes in the way the Assembly works, including the principles of the removal of members and the structure of the comitology system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the Act.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
On the next Sunday, the voters will decide whether their country will soon be named after the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The universal vote is intended to help resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which a region called Macedonia is located.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, the supporters of plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that change is necessary to enable you to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells in the New York church of St.Marcin are silent in connection with the problems of the churches in Harlem
"The older people I talk to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them at present."
As he says, the bar disappearance is understandable.
"Currently, people are socializing in a different way" he noted.
"Bars have ceased to be a place for regular meetings of members of the community."
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that assets from the sale of assets will not be sufficient for as long as decision-makers consider, and that "they will be at the point of departure sooner or later".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment apartments inhabited by people who would not support other nearby temples.
As he said, "The overwhelming majority of people buying houses in such buildings will be the white race. This will speed up the complete closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes."
Both churches were built by a congregation of white believers, before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the Church of St.Marcin joined the community a decade later).
The original assembly of white Methodists left the district in the 1930 ’ s.
At that time, the local African-American assembly took ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Marcin was taken over by the assembly under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the 125th Street sellers (the main shopping street in Harlem), opposed to the employment or promotion of African-Americans.
The 1939 fire significantly damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson’s parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned a team of bells.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in the church of St.Marcin, proudly called the new carylion "the bells of the poor".
The expert who shot the bells in July described them in another way as "cultural treasure" and "unreplaced historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also noted that this was the first carylion in the world supported by black music. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the church of Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he had a bigger band waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Marcin's church didn't replace him.
In recent months, the Church of St. Marcin has had a series of complicated events involving architects and performers, some of which were brought to the site by secular church leaders, and some by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (a parish management body composed of secular leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that "it wants to pass on the costs to the council", although the board did not take part in hiring architects and contractors sent to the site.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the diocese side.
Shark injured a 13-year-old diving in search of lobsters in California
The authorities reported that last Saturday, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diving in search of lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning for about half an hour he dived with his friends when he heard a cry for help. Immediately with a group of friends they sailed to the boy to help get him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first he thought the boy was excited about catching lobster, but soon he realized that the child was screaming: “I got bit!
I've been bitten!"
After reaching the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a completely torn skin around the clavicle.
"I began to shout to everyone to escape from the water: "There is a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Children's Hospital children's hospital in San Diego.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, rescuer Captain Larry Giles said that the fish had been spotted several weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious upper body injuries.
The authorities closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours in order to conduct an investigation and for safety reasons.
Larry Giles noted that over 135 sharks live in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's store network plans to expand its business on the British cosmetics market
The Sainsbury's network throws a glove to shops such as Boots, Superdug and Debenhams, bringing into its supermarkets cosmetic divisions related to stores, as well as specially trained retailers.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetics market, which is worth £2.8 billion and is constantly developing despite the declines in the fashion and household goods industry, 11 online shops will have larger racks with cosmetic products. If successful next year, the action will be extended to next points.
The return to the cosmetics industry is due to the search for ways to use the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's, the network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3,000 articles. The product range will first include products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Currently sold articles from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas similar to those known from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its range of Boutique make-up products. From now on, most articles will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume seller Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first was opened last week in Croydon, southern London, and the second was built in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The popularity of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local shops makes it necessary for supermarkets to encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, President of Sainsbury's, said that points of sale will be more and more like commodity houses, because the network is trying to fight discountes such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's placed Argos points in hundreds of stores and introduced a number of Habitat points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing the sales of food and increasing the profitability of the investment.
The previous attempt to reorganise the divisions with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals has failed.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots. However, the cooperation ended in the wake of a conflict of revenue from supermarkets.
Sainsbury's is introducing a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for an amount of 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to Lloyds, it will contribute to the plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four online stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Director of Commercial Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance and character of the cosmetics department to improve customer impressions.
We have invested in special training for colleagues so that they can help consumers when shopping.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the current ways of making purchases".
Peter Jones "rabid" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, star of the Dragons' Den TV program, was "rabid" when he found out Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from a £11 million Lifestyle brand to focus on the newly established cooperation with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household articles called Truly.
The activities were often compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure through Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave the successful lifestyle brand and to focus on the new cooperation with Marks & Spencer and ITV made by Holly Willoughby enraged Peter Jones, star of the Dragons' Day program.
As sources say, Peter Jones was "rabid" when a popular TV presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to the new contracts of up to £1.5 million, she would not have time to devote herself to their brand offering accessories and articles to the Truly household.
The company was compared earlier to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop. It was also intended to double Holly Willoughby's assets estimated at 11 million pounds.
After the announcement of the decision to leave the Truly brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source: “Marka Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She had her future with her, and she wanted to take care of her for decades to come.
The decision to withdraw from the business completely surprised all those involved.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to entering the market.
In Marlow Warehouse, the goods are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of this Morning and one of the most successful stars in the UK could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including articles from pillows to candles and household articles – as well as further delays in market entry.
It may also mean the end of long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby, together with Tara Capp, founded the "Truly" brand in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them as president in March.
Couples were on vacation together, and Jones included 40% of the share of the TV production company Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to become the M&S Ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity at ITV.
The source similar to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business. ”
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love with each other"
The president was joking about the criticism of the media caused by the remark that some considered to be "non-conceivable to the husband of the state", as well as a positive relationship with the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a funny voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
"I didn't give up anything."
The President pointed out that Kim Jong Un was interested in the second meeting, that the first meeting took place in Singapore in June, and was called upon by Trump as a major step towards the deuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are delayed.
After more than three months from the June summit in Singapore, the head of the North Korean diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a "analogical response" from the United States to early North Korea's disarmament efforts.
He noted that instead the United States maintained sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We have a great deal to do with North Korea," he said.
"We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we're having a wonderful relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had a positive effect: they led to the completion of the missile trials, helped free the hostages and returned to the other American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing his relationship with Kim Jong Un.
"It is easy to behave in the President's way. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to a crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here," said Trump, pointing their finger at the crowd gathered right in front of us.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After an earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the loss of roofing by more than 10% of Lombok’s inhabitants, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid operations.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not demand international support, so the situation is difficult," said Selina Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet certain that international personnel will be able to operate at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Agency for Natural Disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu in order to check whether assistance from international organisations should be allowed.
In the face of the shocks in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although the tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren – despite the warning – is likely to have an impact on the number of deaths.
Even under the most favourable conditions, travelling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship stationed on the island of Lombok is heading for the city of Palu with the help of the earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach its destination.
President Joko Widodo made improvements to Indonesian infrastructure the main point of his campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year's elections, the President's administration is struggling with a lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure because of the continued religious tensions in the country. Members of the majority Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of people lost their roofs as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, arches, arrows and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge scores a draw goal in a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the English Premier League, winning a goal in the 89th minute of the Saturday game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an application from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's 1-0-state goal to the detriment of his team.
Before firing towards the distant goal, he moved the ball to the left leg.
The ball slid high above the penalty field towards the upper right corner of the net.
Then she fell into the gate, flying over Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"I just tried to take a position and accept the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri always try to move it forward as far as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot opportunity," said Sturridge in an interview for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanty coming, I took the ball, and I gave the shot without even thinking further."
Chelsea ran a 1-0 in the middle of the game after the Belgian star Eden Hazard's goal in 25 minutes.
Blue attacker kicked the ball with a heel to Mateo Kovačić and then ran towards the middle of Liverpool.
Kovačić quickly accepted the application in the middle of the field.
He then performed a beautiful play forward in the penalty field back to Gambling.
Gambling overtakes the defenders and left-footed the long-wing arrow that passed the Liverpool goalkeeper, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet the Napoli Club in the Champions League Group on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will meet Videoton at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
According to the Indonesian disaster agency on Sunday morning, the number of victims of the recent earthquake and the tsunami in that country has increased to 832 people.

Cromwell Memorial before the British Parliament last victim in a dispute about "writing history again"
Removing the monument would bring justice for the Taliban's resemblance to destroy many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "trying to write history again".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the dispute about Oliver Cromwell’s character before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
The image-breaking activities during the English civil war were neither commissioned nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps his ancestors, Thomas, had previously been determined to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft introduced Cromwell as a monument shows how much this politician enjoyed in the 19th century and that for many he is a figure that is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith, in an interview for The Sunday Telegraph, said: “For many people, Cromwell was seen – perhaps more often in the 19th century than in the present – as a defender of parliament against external pressures.
The assessment of the appropriateness of this statement is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
But it is certain that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
In China, a pig was beaten to death by a farmer
According to local media, a fatal pig attack on a farmer occurred at a marketplace in the southwest of China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found to have been bled and an artery was cut near a pig at a marketplace in Liupanshui, Kuejczou Province.
The pig breeder is preparing for vaccination in the pigs, 30 May 2005, the city of Xining, in the province of Qinghai (China).
According to reports, a man arrived at the market with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, my cousin found a man's body and noticed an open door to a nearby pigsty.
He said there was a big blood-stained pig in the pig.
The autopsy confirmed that it was a nearly 250-pound pig that killed a farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloodthirsty and bloodthirsty," said a man named Wu quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance footage shows Yuan arrived at the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
The market manager said in an interview for Guiyang Evening News that police have isolated the evidence for the time when police were collecting the evidence to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the men's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for death.
There have been cases of attacks of pigs against humans, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, a nearly 300-pound pig nailed a farmer to a tractor.
After eating a farmer from Oregon by pigs in 2012 one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can liberate their brutal behavior.
"They just want to have fun.
They're as inquisitive as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the right respect," he said.
Rosa storm residue will cause intense rainfall in the southwest of the United States
According to the forecasts, hurricane Rosa is losing strength by moving over colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days it will cause intense rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa blows at almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5.00 p.m. Eastern time it was given category 1. It was then 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to the forecast, Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form than it is heading eastward on the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will be approaching the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the mass of the damp air north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, it will bring precipitation of up to 25 cm in part of Mexico.
In the days to come, wet tropical air that comes into contact with the nearest rain will cause heavy rain in the South West of the United States.
In some places, precipitation between 2.5 and 10 cm will lead to sudden flooding, pollution movement and possible landslides in desert areas.
Moisture tropical air will cause precipitation from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially in the Nevada and Arizona areas.
Even from 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some areas of the South West of the USA, especially over a large part of Arizona.
Due to the distributed nature of tropical rainfall, sudden floods and sudden changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is definitely absconding to travel on foot in the desert.
The heavy rains can turn canyons into storms, and storms with lightning can cause heavy local winds and dust shifts.
Coming before it brings abundant local rainfall on the coast of southern California.
Rains with a total height of more than 1.3 cm are possible, which can cause little pollution and danger on the roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region at present.
The tropical rains will start approaching Arizona on a late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday, precipitation will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and last until Wednesday.
In October, with the cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, temperature fluctuations may occur, but in the interversal zone it will be rather warm.
This can lead to violent changes in temperature at small distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
Between Kansas City (state of Missouri) and Omaha (state of Nebraska), and between St. Louis (state of Missouri) and Des Moines (state of Iowa), these differences are almost 10 degrees Fahrenheit.
In the coming days, the continuing summer temperatures may rise again.
The temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the north-east.
On Tuesday, New York, the temperature can reach up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit, about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term climate forecasts suggest a high probability of above average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's interrogations
More than 20 million people were watching in six television stations on Thursday’s interview of a candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual harassment in the 1980 ’ s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, the commentators had to stop regularly broadcast programmes to report an emergency: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the Senate judicial committee that she's 100% sure that Kavanaugh was smothering her in a state of intoxication and tried to take her clothes off during the high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that such a situation had not happened.
It is possible that the number of TV viewers on Friday was even greater than that given by Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC TVs.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, no figures have yet been available.
In addition, Nielsen tends to find it difficult to measure visibility among people in workplaces.
The number given is similar to the ratings of American Football Cups or the award of American Film Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen reports, Fox News Channel Station, whose speakers strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest ratings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers per day during the hearing.
The second was ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake became a key figure of Friday's events.
In the morning he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after this moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying that he decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. On the video he yells at demonstrators who made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on his way to the jury hearing.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes listened to unfavorable opinions, and the whole event was broadcast by CNN.
"I stand here in front of you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the nation the truth?
You have the strength to face the disease of so many women" - he heard from a demonstrating woman.
Before the elevator door closed, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak during a committee hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events pending the vote on the transmission of Kavanaugh's nominations to the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew the FBI was going to investigate the charges in the coming week, as a minority of Democrats insisted.
Flake was convinced partly of a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting Chris Coons and some other senators.
Flake's election was important because the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into charges against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit
In an interview given to the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plan to leave the European Union to play in the future of Britain and undermine the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Birmingham Conservative Party (United Kingdom), September 29, 2018.
In another interview, alongside Theresa May, the former Foreign Minister in her government, Boris Johnson, attacked the plan of future relations with the European Union in the wake of Brexit, according to which the United Kingdom and the EU could charge their duties on their behalf, calling it "totally ludicrous".
Shootin' Wayde Sims: police arrested Dytheon Simpson suspected of murdering a LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the colours of the University of Louisiana (LSU).
According to reports of a police station in Baton Rouge, 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and arrested under second-degree murder.
The authorities posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS, police officers found these glasses on the scene and found traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
The police informed Simpson that he confessed to the shooting of Wayde.
As the lawyer said, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the Coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police station thanked the Louisiana state police task force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University police, and nearby residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, Director of Sports LSU, thanked local law enforcement for "working and pursuing justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
His father Wayne Sims also played basketball in LSU.
In his last season he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 games per game.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach from LSU Will Wade said that the team was "wrinkled" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is one of the things we are constantly afraid of," said Will Wade.
Ash emitted by a volcano reaches Mexico City
Ashes excavating from the Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the national disaster prevention centre advised the Mexicans to move closer to the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The centre recorded numerous stiflings and shocks.
Photographs published in social media show windshields of cars covered with thin ash layers in Mexico's neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-degree earthquake that hit Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in volcanic activity located 72 km southeast of the country's capital.
Also known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The start of the police with the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of the clash of protestors in support of the independence of Catalonia with police prevention units. On that day, thousands of people participated in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extreme referendum on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of separation cast eggs and powder paint on police officers. Dark dust clouds polluted streets usually full of tourists.
There was also a struggle in the later part of the day, and in order to stop the fighting, the police used a stick.
For a few hours, the independent groups were chanting, "We do not forget, we do not forgive," and the opponents of the secession shouted, "Let Spain live."
According to the local press, fourteen people received medical assistance from minor injuries during the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, the tension does not weaken. Although the authorities in Madrid found it illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for those who want the secession of the Catalans.
The majority voted in favour of independence, but the attendance was low due to the extensive boycott of the opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in violent clashes with the police trying to prevent a vote from being voted in the constituency.
On Friday evening, a group of supporters of the region’s independence decided to prevent demonstrations supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, but the route was forced to change.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who and his wife participated in the protest of the Separatists, said that there was no longer hope for the independence of Catalonia.
"Last year, we had one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote. But now we are stuck at a point without a way out" he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections in December last year, parties supporting the secession of Catalonia have difficulty continuing their activities. Many of the most recognised leaders have decided to leave or await arrest in connection with the role played in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40 - year - old engineer who recorded a protest on the phone supporting the police, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute fueled the conflict.
"The situation is becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced his willingness to launch in the next year's European Parliament elections.
"Cadding elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the democratic crisis of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving a car into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested following a multiple hit by a car in a house in Londonderry.
The event occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. of the British Time (BST).
Commissioner Bob Blemmings of the Investigation and Investigation Department said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car, a crossbow shot could also be fired.
The Mengi Gate provides the Livingston win over the 1-0 Rangers
The first Dolly Menga goal for Livingston brought the team a victory
Since this season, Livingston played in an extraclass and put the Rangers in a stunning state, giving Steven Gerrard a second failure in his 18 games as coach of the club from Ibrox Park.
Dolly Menga's door turned out to be winning, and Gary Holt's band moved second in the table with Hibernian.
The team under the leadership of Gerrard is no longer winning the Premiership this season. On next Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, to which it loses eight points.
Before that, because already on Thursday, Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the UEFA European League.
Livingston extends the victory series in his division to six games. Coach Holt did not have a failure to replace Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a few chances against undisposed opponents
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead much earlier, as the game caused a lot of problems to the Rangers.
First Scott Robinson broke through the defense and shot the goal light, but failed to shoot the goal. Then Alan Lithgow failed to take over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could threaten the rivals during the constant parts of the game.
And that's how the decisive goal fell.
After the Rangers fired the free team Livingston found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the situation of Menga, who got the goal out of the middle of the penalty field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they were unable to enforce the defense of the hosts and did not cause major problems to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos fired one shot at Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by the Rangers' goalkeeper, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to reach the light of the goal from another permanent passage in favor of Livingston.
The Rangers continued attacks in the livingston criminal field, but could not take advantage of the situation. They demanded two criminal shots after Halkett's intervention against the shifter Glenn Middleton and one hand play. In both cases, however, the pretenses of the players were rejected.
"Fenomenal" performance of Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played wonderfully, once again beyond expectations.
Their style and composition have hardly changed since returning to the extract class. However, Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This match had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a perfectly organized defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
While they have great moments under Gerrard's command, they did not keep up with their standards in the game.
In their game, something seemed to be missing: only once did the hosts get through the defense, and this should be a serious warning to the Rangers who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During Saturday's breakfast in Berlin (29 September) the leaders of Turkey and Germany accompanied smiles and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany. The visits were aimed at improving the relationship between NATO allies.
The differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union have led to disputes.
After the meeting Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
This city has the largest number of Turks outside its homeland.
According to the police, for security reasons, 25 thousand crowds gathered outside the temple were blocked, but the president's supporters gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan – including many Kurds – also decided to express their opinion, condemning the policy of the Turkish leader and the decision of the German government to adopt politics in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the divisions of a visit to a policy called a hero by a part of the Turks living in Germany and recognised as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist died of a car crash
The biker died after a car crash in London.
There was an accident near the crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 British Time (BST).
After the accident, the driver stopped the vehicle and the paramedics arrived at the scene, and despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, there was another fatal accident involving a cyclist in Childers Street, about a mile [1 km] away from the scene of the accident.
Metropolitan police report that officers are working on identifying a dead man and informing his family members of the incident.
Roads were closed and bus tours were organized, and drivers were instructed to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Penitentiary: Six officers were injured by the riots
As reported by the authorities, six officers were injured by riots in a criminal facility for men with a higher level of security.
The riots at the HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire began on Sunday at around 9:30 British Time (BST) and are still ongoing.
Eight prisoners in one of the wings of the plant were called to the start with a specialist unit called "Tornado".
Officers on the scene have suffered minor facial injuries.
The Ombudsman said: “In the HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary, specially trained personnel were involved.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our establishments. We believe that those responsible will be transferred to the police and may spend more time in prison."
The HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary has more than 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the director of the facility had to go to the hospital after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the plant was called on by prevention units due to serious riots, where workers were attacked with pool balls.
The sudden floods caused by the Rosa hurricane threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (Possible beneficial impact on the areas covered by the drought)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach Arizona’s state. This will probably happen at the beginning of next week. The remains of hurricane Rosa move through desert areas of the South West, causing a threat to sudden floods.
National Weather Service has already issued a warning on the possibility of an emergency flood on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, south and east Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast on Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix, and on Monday afternoon, the rain will begin.
On Twitter, the National Weather Service in Phoenix reported that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a cyclone or tropical depression at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) reached a distance of 65 km from the border of Arizona".
The latest models of National Hurricane Center forecast precipitation from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach up to 15 cm.
In other desert areas of the South West, including the Central Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, the amount of precipitation is likely to be between 2.5 cm and 5 cm and in some areas to 10 cm.
Those outside the areas at risk of sudden flooding may be relieved by the rainfall associated with Hurricane Rosa, as the region has been struggling with drought for some time now.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where drought is taking place.
As reported by U.S. Drought Monitor, almost 40% of Arizona's area is struggling with severe droughts belonging to the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will first arrive on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with hurricane force, reaching a speed of 137 km/h. It is currently 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane encounters colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
According to forecasts, he's gonna hit Mexico with a tropical storm on a Monday afternoon or an evening.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico may pose a major flood risk.
The weather.com portal reported that "in the area from the California Peninsula to the northwestern part of Sonora, precipitation is expected from 7 to 15 cm, although it can reach 25 cm".
Then the hurricane Rosa passes through Mexico in a northern direction in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in early morning, it reaches the border of Arizona as tropical depression. By Tuesday evening it will travel to the southern part of Utah.
"The most serious threat posed by hurricane Rosa or its remains is the heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the southwest of the United States desert," says National Hurricane Center.
Rains are forecast to cause life - threatening floods and pollution in the desert and mud avalanches in the mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old male were arrested for attempted murder of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, around 4:00 A.M. British Time (BST).
The victim was transported to the hospital, and her condition remains "stable".
According to the Avon and Somerset police, one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old male were arrested in the Radstock area at night.
Officers are requesting contact with all persons holding the incident recordings.
Trump stated that Brett Kavanaugh had "revealed evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the absolute and outrageous conduct of the Democratic Party," said Trump at the rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh “went to know the wickedness and anger of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Congress. He firmly and emotionally denied the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford. A woman claims that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on the charges brought before her.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "Americans could find out about the brilliantness, class and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of the support of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, a expert of the law of great merit to the community," he said in front of a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia.
The President did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, discussing the importance of the Republicans' participation in the halving presidential elections.
"We are five weeks apart from the most important elections in our lives.
I do not start in these elections, but I remain very active" he said.
"I'm still fighting to defend our great candidates."
Trump claims that the Democrats are pursuing a policy of "resistance and obstruction".
As CNN station said, one of the assistants of an important Republican Party policy, the first key Senate vote on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of earthquake victims and tsunamis in Indonesia.
As the authorities said on Saturday, at least 384 people died – many of which were abducted by high waves that crash on the beaches – following a strong earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, in Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival’s city. At dusk, waves of up to 6 meters high hit the shore, kidnaping many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When there was a threat yesterday, people on the beach did not escape immediately and fall victim to the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson of the Indonesian natural disaster agency BNP.
"Tsunami attacked everything on its way, stealing cars, logs and houses," said Nugroho. He added that before reaching the coastline of the nature, he moved to sea at 800 km/h.
As he said, some of them were saving themselves a tree climber, and they managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pal.
The aerial photos published by the disaster agency show many damaged houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was visited by secondary shocks.
There were a number of earthquakes in the area of 2.4 million people.
According to a statement from the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT), the energy liberated by a large Friday earthquake was about two hundred times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement states that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long narrow bay, could have increased the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He then added that the bodies of some of the victims were found in collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 were found missing.
Nugroho said that the fatalities and damage could be greater along the coastline of 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake epicenter.
According to Nugroho, the communication "has been completely paralysed" and therefore there are no reports from the province of Donggala.
"There are more than 300 000 people living there," said the Red Cross, "that workers and volunteers of organisations go to places affected by the disaster."
"We can talk about tragedy now, although the situation may be much worsened," said the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism due to a lack of information about the tsunami hit in Palu, but the authorities stated that the waves had come just after the warning.
On the amateur social media video, you can see a man screaming from the building, trying to warn about the upcoming tsunami of people on the street.
In a few minutes, the water wall crashed across the shore, hijacking buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused significant power shortages, preventing communication within the Palu. This in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
According to the authorities, the military started sending transport aircraft with the assistance of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuators still very much need food and other essential articles of the first need.
The airport in the city was opened exclusively for transport with humanitarian aid. The airport will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is due to visit the centers for people evacuated in Palu.
Over 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As reported by Doseb T. Sinai, the National Director of World Vision, the staff of the organization arrived safely from Donggala Province to Palu City and found shelter in the tents of the Brezent located in the courtyard of the office.
"They told me they saw a lot of broken houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups are slowly starting to provide assistance, there have been criticisms that workers of foreign humanitarian organisations with extensive experience are prevented from travelling to Pal.
According to Indonesian law, receiving funding, resources and foreign personnel can only be started after the disaster has been declared a national disaster.
It hasn't been done yet.
"officially, we are still dealing with a regional disaster," said the spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government finds that a national disaster has occurred, we will be able to accept international aid, but this has not yet happened."
Two days after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami in Palu, friends and families of missing persons still hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders who participated in the Indonesia Asian Games this month.
As Petra Mandagi said, others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As an experienced paraglider, I struggle with my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon Subandono explained how, within hours of the arrival of the paraglider community, he desperately sent messages to athletes attending the festival on the beach about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel.
His messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of a pair of hooks in blue.
"It seems to me that this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole 26,750 USD while filling in cash at the ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to the Newport Police Command on Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee, who supplemented the cash in the ATM at Newport on the Levee shopping centre.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to complete the cash," wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a published release.
Another man ran from behind to Brink's employee and stole a bag of money from an ATM.
According to a report, witnesses saw some suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police didn't report how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information on the identity of thieves are requested to contact the Newport police station at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
He announced his intention on Twitter on Saturday: “A person previously known as Kanye West.”
Forty-one-year-old musician has been using a pseudonym Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change took place before the visit to Saturday Night Live. During the performance, the artist is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
It will replace Ariana Grande, who, according to the creators, gave up her participation in the program for "emotional reasons".
West has already stated that the word "ye" is not only a shortcut from his current artistic nickname, but it is of religious importance.
“It seems to me that “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures it means “You,” said West in the earlier period of the year, discussing the title of an album with a radio presenter named Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and confused qualities.
The album shows who we are."
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known under the aliases of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West associate, also wrote his aliases in different ways, with a connector, without a connection and in capital letters.
The President of Mexico andrés Manuel López Obrador undertakes not to use the military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloodthirsty demonstration of students, the president of the Elect Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) committed never to use the army against civilians.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised to “never use the army to repress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers opened fire in the square towards peaceful demonstrations, killing up to 300 people.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly financial assistance for learners as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people towards criminal groups.
The United States should double its funding for research into artificial intelligence
As Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and expert in artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, with the increase in Chinese activity in this area, the United States should double its research spending in SI.
This comment is related to the announcements on artificial intelligence published by various US government agencies, although the US does not have an official SI strategy.
China, however, presented its plan last year to become the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"To begin with, the SI research budget should be doubled: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview this week, the CNB also said that double funding could double the chances of making another breakthrough in the area of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinvation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most important companies involved in artificial intelligence in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an SI system that defeated the best American player at the time in Othello. He then held a management position at Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognised the success of earlier technological initiatives of the US government, e.g. organized by the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Area (DARPA) of the competition for the most interesting robot projects.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to receive government subsidies.
"It is not China that takes away the best representatives of academics, but corporations," Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to develop SI.
"I believe that people who are engaged in artificial intelligence, who have obtained a doctoral degree, should automatically admit a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create next generation artificial intelligence.
As Lee observed, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of the academic institutions in a way similar to the US National Science Foundation and other government organisations granting American funding. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
In the earlier period of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will engage partners in the work of the world of industry and science. The White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA also informed that USD 2 billion was allocated to an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests over USD 100 billion a year in research on SI.
At the same time, the US initiative to set up a National Committee on the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has not been a step forward for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing their country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow for the elimination of several decades of dispute with Greece, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the historic country of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and therefore vetoes the accession of the country to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of both countries reached an agreement on the name, but nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
The campaign to encourage boycott raised doubts as to whether the attendance would reach the minimum level of 50% required for the referendum to be binding.
The referendum asks the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of the agreement with Greece".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, argue that it is worth paying the price for joining Macedonia, one of the countries created after the fall of Yugoslavia, to organisations such as the European Union and NATO.
"I have voted in favour of the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us with greater security for all," said the 79-year-old Oljera Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that it respects the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two-thirds of the members of Parliament.
The National Electoral Committee has informed that no unusual events have been recorded until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at this time was only 16% compared to 34% in the recent 2016 parliamentary elections. 66% of the eligible people voted then.
"I voted for my children. Our place is in Europe," said Mr Tanewski, the voter from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of the country Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and his son Duszko voted in a referendum on the change of the name of the country in order to open the way to membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the building of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents distributed by the boycotters of the referendum.
"We support NATO and EU membership, but we want to join these organizations with our heads up, not the back door," said Kawardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can address other countries such as China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew claims that membership of NATO will bring the necessary investments of Macedonia, in which the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the change of name in the referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO," said Zaew after his vote.
He said that the "yes" vote was a "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published on the last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute, from 30 to 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required attendance.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telma TV, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote in the Sunday referendum.
70% said they would support a name change.
To succeed, the vote must be 50% + 1 vote.
Failure in the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since the takeover of power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City beats Brighton's entire defense and wins the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton's defense home in a 2–0 Saturday meeting for Manchester City. The game was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
The gate acquired by Aguera in 65 minutes looked like a child's easy one.
The action started with an application in the middle of the field to the Argentinian attacker.
The baller overcame three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was among four Brighton players.
First he played one of them, and then he beat the others and found himself at the edge of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English attacker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in a penalty field that defeated Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the goal.
“Aguero is struggling with a foot injury,” he told the journalists about the coach of Manchester City Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
"We were lucky to have scored the goal at that time."
However, Sterling was the one who provided the blue first lead in a duel in the Premier League.
The gate in question fell in 29 minutes.
In action of this Aguero, he got the ball deep in half of Brighton.
He sent a wonderful application along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to a remote pole.
Manchester City's assailant put the ball in the net right before it hit the cars.
Manchester City will meet Hoffenheim in the UEFA Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of winning the Rockies
After losing the chance to participate in the playoffs phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer, he didn't have to be in the first line-up.
However, the loving competition Scherzer hopes to perform in a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies if the Rockies retain the chance to perform in the playoffs. Currently, the team has one more victory than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
Rockies can at least count on the wild card if they win a Friday meeting against the Nationals result 5:2. However, they still want to get their first division title.
“Although we play for nothing, we will at least go out on the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of the opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in this meeting."
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting pitcher for a Sunday meeting, but the team is inclined to exhibit Scherzer in the first lineup.
This would be the thirty-fourth performance of Scherzer in the first lineup. The player took part in the Thursday's pitching exercise and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington recorded the results of 18-7 and the ERA 2.53.300 times eliminated the hitters and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trumpa in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as Supreme Court judge, discussing the importance of the Republicans' participation in the halving presidential elections.
"In November, we are putting all the achievements we have achieved so far.
We are five weeks apart from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I do not start, I remain very active. I constantly defend our wonderful candidates" - he said.
He then continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we are seeing their actions with our own eyes.
They're determined to take power with all possible means.
They don't care who they hurt and who they have to hurt to gain power and control, and taking power and controlling is their goal, but we're not giving it back to them."
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"It has been very good to see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad, mean, unpleasant and untruthful."
The president referred to the Senate judicial committee, recalling the U.S. senator from the Democratic Party, Dianne Feinstein, which came up with a loud buzzing from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for leaking the document?
«Uh, I'm sorry?
No... I mean... no. Her body language was terrible. It was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to those expressing their own opinions
When the agents of the Momentum organization in my party voted to give me the blame, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am a member of the Working Party Group, who was recently told that they were not welcome, and all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the application for a reprimand was due to the difference of opinion between Jeremy Corbyn and I.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. As to the irony of fate, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
On Friday's announcement about the meeting of the Labour Party parliamentarians from the Nottingham East district, we read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years, I have served as a Labour Party member, most of the Friday meetings of the General Committee looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now taking place differently. Long time ago, promises of a "kinder and more gentler" policy, if ever remembered.
It is increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views; each opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the management of the party.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took the position of President, and colleagues who seemed to me to have similar views began to expect me to change the direction and take up positions that I would not have agreed with before, such as national security or the EU's single market.
After every public speech, regardless of the content, I meet in the social media with attacks calling for nominations, condemning centralism or leaving the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are rather political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the daily order with the insulting of others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every request for a "confidence" and every change in the rules of choice, the worldview of the party is narrowed down.
Over the last two years, I have been repeatedly suggested not to hesitate and remain silent, and then everything would be "fine".
But that's not why I've taken up politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of Margaret Thatcher's neglects, which led to the breakup of my school class, I have been trying to ensure a better quality of public services for those in need – both as a local councillor and as a minister.
I've never covered my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew the differences of opinion with the authorities of the party.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the President of the Labour Committee in the face of the upcoming Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services.
The most important message, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both the members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to serve you. I promise that no threat of withdrawal of nominations or ad hoc political goals will discourage me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17 – Invincible Ayr again at the top
Two late-onsets could have slightly distorted the final score, but it is no doubt that Ayr earned a victory in this very interesting Scottish extra-league match.
The team was number one on the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, it is a distinctive defense and a better use of opportunities led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could have been happy with his caregivers.
"The previous matches have been a challenge for us, but we are still invincible, so I am happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: "We need to pay respect to Ayr players.
Ayr left in the 14th minute after the application of Grant Anderson and the increase of Frazier Clim. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes's scotch, who came to the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to balance the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an untapped chance to raise.
Climo increased the lead of Ayr when he was kicked from the penalty throw just before the end of the first half. First he won the touchdown and then took the opportunity to raise, achieving a score of 17:5 for Ayr.
The second half of Melrose's grip on Patrick Anderson, raised by Baggot, reduced the loss to five points.
The game was then stopped for a long time due to Ruaridha Knott's serious injury. The player was removed from the field on the stretchers. After Ayr resumed, he increased the lead after Stafford McDowall was applied and the Clim was raised.
Following on, the captain of the Ayr Blair Macpherson team received a yellow card. Melrose re-used its number: the application with unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for killing Climate without a ball. MacPherson won the touchdown on the back of the upcoming defense.
Climo took the chance to raise, and then again he managed to increase the score just after Kyle Rowe re-established the game when he took the shot from the penalty shot and allowed Wing Gregor Henry to take the fifth hit for the host.
Star of Still Game is starting a career in the gastronomy industry
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems to be starting out in the gastronomy industry.
A 56-year-old actor acts as Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular sitcom. He performs and co-creates the show together with his many-year-old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the coming ninth season would be the last in the history of the series. All indications indicate that Ford Kiernan is planning the future after leaving “Craiglang”.
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this subject, although the informant Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in the “growing gastronomy” industry in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": without access to the sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The Navy is patrolling around the base of the Navy in La Paz.
Blue flags come from public buildings.
The ports of the Navy from Lake Titicaca to Amazon have the following motto: “The sea is ours by law.
It's our duty to recover him."
In the unavailable sea of Bolivia, the mention of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of resources from the 19th century is still alive.
Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which is due on 1 October after a five-year trial.
“ Bolivia’s actions are getting a lot of momentum. Residents are unanimity, optimistic, and hope for a favourable verdict,” said diplomat Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching a meeting of the International Court of Justice together, hoping that the Hague-based organisation will recognise Bolivia's claim and that after decades of fruitless talks Chile will have to negotiate to grant independent access to the sea to the State.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who will stand up for the controversial fight for reelection next year, also hopes for Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts argue that the chances of a ruling benefiting Bolivia are small and that even a favourable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body, based in The Hague, has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile, and it has also reserved that it will not affect the determination of possible talks.
As Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert, said, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be made six months after the final argument was put forward.
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to move its country away from its destination for the last four years.
"The question of access to the sea was owned by the current Bolivian administration," said Paz Zárate.
The relentless rhetoric of Morales deprived the Chileans of any goodwill, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their conversation at some point, but it will be very difficult to face the situation.
There has been no exchange of ambassadors for both of these countries since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former President and Representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree with the view that the decision-making process of the court was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia “a unique opportunity to start a new era in terms of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “to end a 139-year dispute period with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, was using the subject of access to the sea as a political element.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an excellent opportunity to believe that we must deal with the past."
North Korean rulers say that nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, states that his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore Summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appeared to be at the forefront of the resumption of the suspended nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that the "frozen" is that the absence of sanctions and the U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean war has ever thrown North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign a declaration without Pjongyang taking concrete disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread scepticism about the fact that Pyongyang takes seriously the destruction of an arsenal that is seen in North Korea as the only security measure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Parisian fashion shows announce the emergence of the latest line of great headgear in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely cover yourself in front of the sun, we have good information for you.
The fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, over-dimensional headgears of their 2019 summer collection that dazzled in style during the Paris Fashion Week.
The most impractical hats were on Instagram this summer. These designers decided to present their stunning creations on the runway.
Valentino’s outstanding work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathered crown flooding the head of models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple — but they were not designed to warm their heads.
Thom Browne also showed a number of strange masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had their lips sewn and resembled Hannibal Lecter's style more than a haute couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment with tubes and glasses, and another one looked like melted ice cream.
And if you don't want to break up with great fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats can be found in clothing stores.
Non-dimensional hats follow right behind "La Bomba", a straw hat with a wide of 61 cm, which everyone had already worn – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this incredibly impractical hat, which spread through the social media, presented another great creation on the run — a straw beach bag almost as big as the model wearing it dressed in a bathing suit.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia frescoes and finished with white leather handle, was distinguished in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the summer season 2019 during the fashion week Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Army, a stylist of the stars, said FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in stores next summer, because the designer has managed to exert such a great influence, it would be difficult not to use the demand for over-dimensional accessories.”
John Edward: language skills needed for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements — in 2018, they were able to boast further outstanding exams, based on individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other social ventures.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) of schools, attended by over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are committed to providing the best level of services provided to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their career pathways and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the possibility to develop and implement a curricula tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another man in a language he understands, then it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that the languages take the first place in league rankings, with the highest performance indicators occurring in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received a higher A rating.
The data collected from 74 SCIS Member States showed that 72 percent of students received higher A in Mandarin and 72 percent in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish also received A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, language learning, as an object of choice, is carried out in the same scope as STEM (scientifics, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the framework of curricula in independent schools and elsewhere.
The 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that 17 percent of employers’ lack of language skills was due to difficulties in filling job vacancies.
Language skills are therefore increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people for their careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with an increasing number of jobs requiring language skills,
Lifelong skills, such as learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future, regardless of the chosen path of professional development.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual in relation to competition.
According to the 2013 survey of YouGov, in which more than 4,000 adults of the British participated, 75% of them were unable to speak well enough in a foreign language to speak and the French language was the only language whose percentage of users was double-digit, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in teaching foreign languages is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding adequate employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in its language.
Many schools will focus on more traditional modern languages, while others will learn languages considered to be the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interest, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from, which will be taught by specialist teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are involved in creating a teaching environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of what the future prepares for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment languages are still crucial for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer a wide choice, diversity and level to Scottish youth.
It's just the right thing to do.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut on the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans who want to see LeBron James' debut in Los Angeles Lakers have finally arrived.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that LeBron James would play the Sunday pre-season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one but less than 48," Walton stated on the official Lakers website.
Lakers Reporter, Mike Trudell, said on Twitter that James is most likely to play a small number of minutes.
After training, which took place early this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to take part in pre-season games to prepare," he said.
West Virginia election Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election rallyes at Wheeling in West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of Trump's five electoral rallyes planned to take place next week, along with the stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote confirming his suspension of office in the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the government, as the Republicans may threaten to lose control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time will be tonight's election Trump in West Virginia, and where will you be able to watch it on the Internet?
So Trump's election in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held today at 7 p.m., Saturday 29 September 2018.
So Trump's election in West Virginia will be able to follow you live on the Internet with YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week's hearings of a nominee nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of sexual abuse and the envisaged vote in the Senate on suspension of the election for a maximum period of one week, for the time of the FBI's investigation.
However, the main objective of this electoral rally is to support the Republicans in the face of difficult November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign with five rallyes next week aims to "mobilize volunteers and supporters to help the Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives." — Reuters.
"The Congress check is such an important point in the President's schedule that as the campaign is approaching, it will visit as many states as possible," said Trump's campaign spokesman, who refused to give his name, Reuters.
Today's election rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia, a state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016, the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia candidate for the Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president arrives to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows the spirit of fighting, maintaining hope of winning in Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating drive shuttle is a completely imaginary sport concept, but it is the kind that players really believe in, and the most important thing about competitions like this.
So what's their momentum at this point?
"They've been leading by six points, and now they're only leading by four, so I think we've got a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth.
Of course, Europe leads by four points, while there are still twelve to be achieved.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind in the sails and have worthy role models to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them could boast three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
Screams on the whole throat as a sign of excitement became louder during his round, flooding the key putt and winning the match when he and Thomas won two holes in two hits.
His reflection on the earth, which gave them a victory with the outcome of 15, came with a similar cry — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in play.
"Just focus and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all that's left of all these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple of the European team won four out of four and was right.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't get a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also escaped the Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back Nine on Friday morning.
The way of the game and how their energy seems to swim both to and from the noisy crowd proves that you should beat these players on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, which could seal the potential victory of the European team at Le Golf National.
It would be best if they played different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, a fourball hero in the morning when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and twice the double on the front of the Nine dug a Spanish and a Swede into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday who can help you get out of the hole.
The fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how the strategy can change at one point in time.
Europe has played better so far as a team and has taken a significant advantage on the last day, but the foursome session has also shown that the US team has a struggle that some have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe with a result of 10-6 includes leading on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 Saturday fourball and foursome games with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — gave him two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, increasing his score to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European band, trying to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning format fourball, winning the series with the result of 3-1.
The United States resisted the foursome format by winning two games, but they could not make up for the loss.
To preserve the trophy, Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points out of 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while together with Molinari (the band was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) is just the second couple in the history of the Ryder Cup, which won four points in four opening games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball format, they beat Woods and American debutant Brison Dechambeau in an even more empathetic way.
Woods, who got tired of two Saturday games, occasionally showed a flash of genius, but lost 19 out of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in foursome format to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in the world rankings of items 1 and 3 respectively.
The European team, however, did not everything in its thoughts in this pleasant, cool day in a field set out to the southwest of Paris.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a reference point for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a strong 2&1 victory over Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a 4&3 result in foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team made a four-point loss, starting with a single, although the Fury team would only need a tie to preserve the trophy.
Two days ago, however, Sunday’s counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says "resolutely not" to unilateral disarmament without trust.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during the UN speech that the lack of sanctions only deepens the lack of confidence of North Korea in the United States and there is no way that country unilaterally abandons nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill" measures last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and the commitment not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we see no concrete response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no guarantee of our national security, and under such circumstances there is no unilateral disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s reluctance to a “degree” approach to deuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual action, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation, as was the case in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump on the first ever summit between the President-in-Office of the United States and the leader of North Korea, which took place in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim Jong Un committed himself to working for the "deaclearisation of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea was expecting the formal end of the Korean war (1950-1953), but the U.S. representative announced that Pyongyang had to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resisted calls to mitigate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "deuclearisation in the first place" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even opposed to signing the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
“The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the frost of people who act ignorantly toward us.
The problem is, however, that the lack of sanctions increases our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which was discussed at the beginning of the week by the United States leader at the UN.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If South Korea were a party to denuclearisation, rather than the United States, there was no such deadlock in the deuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula".
Mim, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different from that of the previous year, when he said at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean rockets in the United States is inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump (Mr. Bad President Trump) called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" (man rocket) on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN Trump, which threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, Kim Jong Un praised his courage to take action to disarm, but he also said that there was still a lot of work to be done and that until North Korea was deprived of nuclear weapons, the sanctions would not be lifted.
On Wednesday Trump said that he did not set a time interval for this, saying: “No matter if it takes two years, three years or five months, it does not matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue and be continuous until we find full, definitive and verified denuclearisation".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea, trying to choke the funding of the Pyongyang nuclear program and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly Forum and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, and in a matter of hours North Korea condemned him for "putting gang demands".
This month, North Korea committed itself to disassembly a missile test site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He stated that Kim Jong Un had told him that the "appropriate measures" he cared about were the security guarantees Trump had made in Singapore and the steps to standardise relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on a sufficiently long rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has provided all students with more sleep to combat the growing macho culture of learning by all-night caffeine-driven students.
Students from the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he thought was the first one in the United States.
To create the course, he was inspired to speak about the impact of sleep deprivation on science.
“ At the end of the speech, a girl approached me and said: “Why am I being told this only now that I am in my senior year of college? ”
She said that no one had ever told her the meaning of sleep, which surprised me," said The Telegraph.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, students are told how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sport and improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Health, said that the course was decided to introduce after it was found that students suffered from severe sleeplessness within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes an image of a dorm room where students click on a cup of coffee, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light and how sleep shortage affects sports results as well as how important it is to maintain the regularity of sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleeplessness may increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not cause immediate change in students' behaviour.
But we believe they have the right to know – like everyone else, they have the right to know what the health consequences of smoking are," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "night science" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means an increasing problem of sleeplessness.
Ensuring a sufficient amount of good quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even to avoid weight gain, because the lack of sleep makes the brain go hungry, so the student is always hungry," he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a course for the entire campus.
The next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study programme before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a reminder alarm when they need to go to bed and when they need to get up and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic display devices and LED lighting, which can dissipate the daily rhythm and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes down Gerrard's team
The Rangers again suffered from a struggle on their way to Livingston when Dolly Menga shot down Steven Gerrard's disassembled team with a 1-0 score.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record their first victory from the 4-1 St Johnstone triumph in February, but for the second time, Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard in 18 games, causing his team to make a difference of eight points compared to the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga scored a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers showing a lack of commitment didn't look like he was gonna get better.
While the Rangers were in sixth place, Livingston went up to third, just beyond the Hibernian with one goal lost.
The Rangers team may have further problems with the need to provide the head wound of the Calum Spence linear judge after he was hit by an object thrown out of the stands for the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team, allowing Ayr to move on to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went through with the same 11th Livingston, who took the Hearts point last week, and was thrilled to see how his well-trained team tortured at every step of its opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball once they got it.
They should have gotten a goal in just two minutes, when the first ball display by Menga allowed Scott Pittman to face the goal of Allan McGregor, but the helper didn't take his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then addressed a deep throw free of charge to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, who played for the defense, could only remain in the rear position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quadrant, but it looked like they had more hope than they believed in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had a penitentiary for fifteen minutes before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless ran into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson solved the Colombian claim.
The Rangers were only able to fire two shots in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox, Liam Kelly, barely worried about Lassana Coulibala's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While the goal-opening goal won by Livingston in 34 minutes may have been the opposite of the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their own effort to win it.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs’ deep permanent piece of the game.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball into Scott Robinson, who remained calm, giving it to Menga in order to simply finish the action.
Gerrard did not waste his break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent — a switch that almost immediately influenced the wingman who threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it from his position.
The Livingston team continued to attract guests into the game exactly the way they like it when Lithgow and Halkett made long applications one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor made a good bet on Jacobs, and then Lithgov pulled the game off the corner.
The reserve Rangers, Glenn Middleton, had once again hoped to throw a penalty when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyesight again.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
And now the page from our Sunday Morning issue of Almanac: 30 September 1882 — 136 years ago... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counter has become both an element of science and pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which these seemingly unlikely cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans performed:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: "You're hearing something now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" hostile cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise hostile cells during treatment.
This method is to separate the immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory.
Then they can "see" the protein common to many cancers. Then they are injected into the body again.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a single woman treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognise hostile cells, ovarian cancer was observed to decline for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate the immune cells from the patient, change them into a laboratory so that they can "see" the protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject them to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: “Our results show that this vaccine is a very good year. ”
HER2 “drives the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast, ovary, lung and colon, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and learning to locate cancer cells, worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanye West is going on a pro-trump diatribe in Saturday Night Live with a MAGA cap on her head.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was "exploited" in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after he praised the president of the United States of Donald Trump and said he would apply for office in 2020.
After performing that night his third piece called Ghost Town, where he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he led against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“When I talk to white people, I hear: “How can you like Trump? He’s a racist!”
If I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before a Senate judicial committee concerning sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not transmitted, the video from West was sent to the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock wanted to laugh at West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems with his hat behind the scenes.
"They got behind my back.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're on me!
And then they say I have no choice," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You say I have no choice, ” adding: “I will wear a supermen cape, so that you will not be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Let's accept ourselves."
His words called for “buking” to the audience twice, and the members of the SNL crew looked embarrassed, reports Variety.
West was invited to replace Ariana Grande's former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many by the performance of the song I Love it in changing the water bottle Perrier.
West received support from the head of the conservative group of TPUS, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "To one of the bravest: Thank you for setting up the Mafia".
Karen Hunter, who was leading the talk show on her Twitter, said that West simply "was himself and it is absolutely wonderful".
"However, I will NOT reward people (by buying her music or clothing or supporting her "art"), which I believe accepts and spreads harmful ideology to my community.
He's free.
We're free, too," she added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — he follows Diddy’s footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, accepted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist known earlier as Prince.

A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is due to appear on Monday at the Grocery Court in Belfast.
The prosecution will investigate the charges.
Star Game about the throne Kit Harington deals with the topic of toxic manhood
Kit Harington is well known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's "Game of Thrones" set in the Middle Ages.
A 31-year-old actor hit the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys often think they have to play tough men to be respected.
In the Sunday Times Culture interview, Kit said that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #Metoo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the Throne Game Plan, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that she was feeling " Pretty confident," addressing this issue.
“I personally feel quite confident at this point — where we have made a mistake on the subject of masculinity,” he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, looking at the problem we are facing today?"
Kit believes that the development of toxic masculinity may be partly responsible for the presentation of very male forms.
He continued: “What attitudes are innate, and what attitudes are taught?
What does he learn on television and on the streets, making young boys think they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change that?
It's clear that things aren't okay with young men."
In his interview he also admitted that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel Game of the Throne after the series was completed next year, saying that he "departed with the fields of battles and horses".
From November, Kit will play "True West" by Sam Shepard, who is the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the set, which provided me with my future family and a new life," he said.
In this award-winning Emmy of Fantasy Rose, she played Ygritte, the object of the love-interested character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China has a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820 000 people affected, reported by healthcare professionals in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which means a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of a blood-infected transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been almost completely reduced, as Chinese health professionals have said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to a year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to insufficient security during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided widespread access to HIV medicines in efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denys that one of her team members discloses the data of Republican Party senators — these are “hazardous lies” and “conspiracy theory”.
A member of the United States House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected the allegations that a member of her team posted the personal data of the three Republican senators on the Wikipedia website of the aforementioned legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party assured that these accusations were made by experts and websites linked to "ultra-right wings".
"The lies, the lies, and even more wicked lies," she told Waters in her Twitter statement.
Public information was reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
It was posted by an unknown person on the Capitol during a panel hearing in the Senate about sexual offences committed against a nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after Kavanaugh's candidacy was questioned by three senators.
Conservatives such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and published information on the Waters team member, as Hill states.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and it is a 100-percent lie", continued Waters.
“The member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security were violated by these fraudulent and false accusations — was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false, and it's a 100-percent lie."
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman.
"This is the way of denial," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't provoke.
He shall not question the motives of the person accused.
For that, he must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats at the address of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of exhibiting excessive anger during a Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate for the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"A thick case, if that's true," he wrote on Tweeter.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had notified "the competent authorities and law enforcement of these fraudulent accusations".
"The complainants will be exposed and held responsible for all their actions which pose a threat to any member of my team," she said.
Johnny English Review: Nokaut – spy parody with a weakened Rowan Atkinson
It seems to be the case for a new part of the series of films from the genre of "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the cinema screens in 2011 with the movie "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will the self-contained satire about how hopeless we are become the new export product of the country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has been given a license to party — his name more than anything else indicates that he is an extensive, comical product designed for non - English audiences.
He is, of course, a foolish, secret agent who, despite his strange likes of smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of jasi beans and a drop of this guy adding one note to the melody of the chariots of fire theme for the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world-class mystery man — Atkinson used to play in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he left his chaos behind.
In the latest film series Johnny English, one or two moments are worth mentioning.
I loved the scene in which Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was rhymingly struck by rotor blades.
The screen clearly shows Atkinson's gift to physical comedy, but the sense of humor seems quite low and unnecessary, especially since currently also "serious" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem rather to be directed to children instead of adults — in my opinion, the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not as ingenious and consistent as the gags in the silent Atkinson movies about Jasio Bean.
The current assumption has always been that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker penetrates the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British field agents to the terror of an agent in the service, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the bitterness of the Prime Minister, which is a pompous, wasted figure already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power, embodying himself in the character of Theresa May, but the scenario does not give her the opportunity to develop wings.
Her intelligence advisors tell her that in order to reveal the identity of all active spies, she's going to have to reintroduce one of the retired agents.
And that means Johnny English himself, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few good reptiles when teaching spy lessons by English.
English is called to Whitehall for the briefing, reconnecting with his former Bough assistant, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the commander of the submarine, a cheerful but slightly tired figure played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin party in the secret service of Her Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously dominated by the charismatic billionaire-technique, who claims to be able to solve the UK’s computer problems — Jason Volt, a villain, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: dressed as waiters they set the French restaurant on fire; they bring chaos, sneaking on board the luxury yacht Volty; and English sows desolation while using the set to virtual reality to get familiar with the interior of the Volty house.
In the latter sequence, all limitations disappear, but despite a nice and loud performance, the whole film is very much like a television for children.
A typical midrange.
Like other Johnny English films, I couldn't resist the idea: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
The working party denies that it is drawing up a plan, which provides for a four-day working week for the British, for which they will receive a salary for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's work party will consider putting in place a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, receiving a five-day salary.
The party is said to want the company's bosses to give savings to employees through a revolution related to the development of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an extra day off.
This would allow workers to enjoy a three - day weekend, earning the same amount of remuneration.
Sources say that this idea "will fit" into the economic program of the party and plans to go out to the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way of using employees to change the economy.
The senior member of the Labour Party, in an interview with the Sunday Times, said: "It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of this year".
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is something that fits in with the party’s approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea, the Green Party committed itself to introducing a four-day week of work during an election campaign in 2017.
However, these plans are currently not supported by all the members of the Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesman said: "The 4th working week is not the party's policy and its introduction is not considered."
John McDonnell, the Chancellor of the Shadow Office, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless directors" and "speculants" in public utility companies.
The Chancellor's plans from the shadow office also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their full share, as the Labour Party's government could make a "deduction" based on the abuses found.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees on company boards and to set up inclusive equity funds to transfer 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer in "60 minutes" to the question of whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can change their attitude
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, and has raised questions as to whether the finding of an investigative office could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview conducted on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that might lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina friend.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
“I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh when I attended the hearing.
I called him after what happened when the charge came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined and unequivocal."
Graham's opinion, however, seems to be forged in stone.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it takes a strong charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett has strongly denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“ None of the people he gives could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's gonna change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to any reduction in the level of poverty?
Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York next Saturday, an annual music event that boasts the most impressive composition of the stars and an equally impressive mission to eradicate world poverty.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the main objective of this event, which is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is the extension of the Global Converty Project, an international group of activists to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless it was decided to purchase a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to a world leader, making a phone call or other significant actions to help raise awareness of the purpose of eliminating poverty.
But what successes can Global Citizen boast over the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to need action or another case of so-called "cliktivism" when people feel that they are doing something important by signing a petition online or placing an entry on a Tweeter?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded by people supporting the action in order to achieve many different objectives.
It also states that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to declare commitments and provisions worth over 37 billion dollars, which are to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, which already paid or financed at least $10 billion.
The Group estimates that so far secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the British Partnership of Investors and Realists involved in "helping children achieve their full potential", which promised to hand over $35 million to Rwanda to help deal with malnutrition in that country, after Global Citizen members sent over 4700 tweets.
"With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizen, such as you, we can make social injustices such as malnutrition go back to history" — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions were carried out calling on the UK to improve the quality of mothers and children's nutrition, the government announced the funding of the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which was "How can we be sure that extreme poverty can be eliminated?",
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult way — sometimes we will stumble and suffer failures.
But as with the former great movements for civil rights and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monnáe are among the stars at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to "block" Russian energy exports — Home Affairs Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" flee to its Navy to prevent the influx of Russian energy on the markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed to the United States Secretary of Home Affairs, Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s commitment to Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government — was an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to be intermediated in energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, through its Navy, has the opportunity to make sure that the sea routes remain open and, if necessary, create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were in fact the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is about the use and replacement of fuels," he said, comparing Russia to a "cuckoo who knows one trick" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements were made when Trump’s administration continued its mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe — a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump's officials, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, worth $11 billion, which is to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an economic project alone.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the implementation of this project is due solely to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said the Russian Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting with the US Secretary for Energy Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States triggered a rapid response by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation of Germany, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think this is a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting by German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she would consider running for president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections she would consider running for president.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, as well as for women who hold the highest position," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidacy for President."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying that she was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren, without a garden, expressed her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, on Twitter, Warren wrote: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most voters do not think that they should be running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the Massachusetts voters who chose the option "probably" said that the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent of the people in support of his potential candidacy, and 48 percent of the people opposed him.
Other well-known names from the democratic camp taken into account for the potential candidate in 2020 were former vice president Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin talks about Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD) during Donald Trump's election rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested on a Monday night and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, which he must go through when he comes back, I understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are returning with," said Donald Trump at the election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of her son "the taboo theme", after which she said about her son and other war veterans: "They return a little changed, they return hardened, they return, wondering if it will be shown respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all other members of the army have given away their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, incitement to false testimony in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon in an unbreasted state, as Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Washington Police Department.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia are in favour of a legal challenge for a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
The 18 states and district representatives in Washington, D.C., wrote a letter of amicus curić to support an asylum seekers struggling with this policy, says NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, was not disclosed.
She said that her partner “and his violent gang sons” were bullying her, but the U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was stopped in Texas.
The above-mentioned state prosecutors in support of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the US as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy repealed the 2014 Board of Immigration Apps, which allowed undocumented immigrants to seek asylum from domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Colombia, said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the state, federal and international law for decades".
"Federal law requires all applications for asylum to be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle" as stated in the list of amicus curić.
The prosecutors continued to argue in the letter that a policy refusing to enter would harm the United States economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and be "necessary labour".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on a racial, religious, national basis or because of belonging to a particular social group or who have such and not other political beliefs," said Sessions in his statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems — even the serious ones — that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu when the number of deaths doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
The situation has become more and more tragic for the survivors.
"It's a very intense feeling," said 35-year-old Risa Kusum's mother, comforting her warm-up son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
There's no clean water."
Residents were seen returning to the destroyed homes, searching for things filled with water and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees, quickly overflowed.
Some wounded, including Two Haris, who had a fractured spine and arm, were resting outside of a military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to severe secondary shocks.
The tears filled his eyes, as he spoke of a violent earthquake that shaken the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed into the wall," Haris said the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, and then she shut her voice.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador is accusing China of "tapping" propaganda advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four - page ad in an American newspaper that praised the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the paying addition of the China Daily to the Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa, accusing China of trying to interfere with the United States Congress elections that will take place on November 6th, China is denying this charge.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the United States elections confirmed what the U.S. officials told Reuters that this was a new stage in the escalation of the Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently conducting an escalation of trade war, which has led to increased tariffs on mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were intended to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Trump Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China, and the former long-term governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in a Sunday edition of Des Moines Register that China “now with double power begins harassment, placing propaganda advertising in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the honorable American tradition of freedom of speech and free press by putting a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
However, there will be no opposition in the Beijing newsstand and there will be no real reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the worrying economic direction chosen by China, given that the media are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans take women with the right to vote before the mid-term elections through Kavanaugh, warn analysts
While many leading Republicans support and defend the nominee for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault charges, the analyst warns that you will meet during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent response, especially from women.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely large, and most Republicans already officially want to vote.
"This cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School, University of Syracuse, in a post published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts about Senator Jeff Flake (Arison)'s efforts to conduct a last-minute investigation by the FBI enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and will not forget it by November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokesperson of the National Progressive MoveOn Group, published in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters were chanting the slogan "It's November coming," demonstrating in the Senate lobby that Republicans have decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, as Mic said.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond scale" said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“ People say he was already tall — and it is true.
But it may be higher, especially among the undecided women of the suburbs and younger voters aged between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Before a public statement by Ford detailing her sexual assault charges addressed to a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republicans decided to approve the candidacy, this could be a violent reaction.
"The Republican Party must deal with a small mess," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also about the way the Republicans have handled this situation and how Ford has been treated", said Guy Cecil, the director of the U.S. Priorities, a group that assists in the selection of Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided about who to believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with the latter being slightly more supportive.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of the respondents strongly or rather believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent found that they had definitely or rather believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents claimed that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during the testimony, while only 30% reported the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake, the FBI launched an investigation into the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified last week, under oath of the Senate Court of Justice, that Kavanaugh had been assaulted at the age of 17 under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez claims that the nominee to the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia during her admission to Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web network, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source – Solid – platform owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the goal of creating Inrupt was "world domination".
"We must do this now," he said, referring to the startup.
"The historic moment has arrived."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own "Internet Store with Personal Data" or otherwise Pod.
It can include contact lists, list of things to do, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of an online data store is that it entirely depends on the user who has access to what information.
This is what the company calls a personal data-processing facility.
According to the CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.

Bernard Vann: distinction of the clergyman with the Victoria Cross during World War I
The memory of the only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Cross of Victoria during World War I, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded on 29 September 1918 for his assault on Bellengly and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he was awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren exposed a memorial stone at the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the revelation of the stone on the centenary of his grandfather's award was "a uniquely symbolic character".
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal on September 29, 1918, “in a very dense fog and under a strong fire from the field and machine guns.”
He then hurried to the line of fire, and with the "most courage" he led it forward, after which he single-handedly launched an attack on the station of the field guns, disposing of three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years old) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I would never be able to cope with, but at the same time something humble".
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he made a wreath after the end of a parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support he receives from many people".
The MMA fans won't sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine if you hadn't slept all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala, and eventually couldn't see the main fight.
The gala program in San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main chart, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, the audience in the UK were shocked by the change to the Peppa Pig Program.
Some were disappointed after not sleeping until early morning hours specifically to see this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described a switch to a cartoon for children as "some kind of sick joke".
"In accordance with the government regulation, the content of this type of content is inadequate to be released at 6 a.m., so it was necessary to change for the children's programme", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication of Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Pig, yeah."
The president of the Bellator organization, Scott Coker, said that they would work out a schedule to include the audiences of the UK in the future.
"When I think about the replay of the situation, I think we can fix it," said Coker.
“But it is Sunday 6am, so we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we had a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't a fault, it was a legal matter.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — a standard amount — and we wanted to please the fans too hard and unfortunately overtaken them.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him an incentive to succeed.
A 24-year-old said he didn't realize that they weren't all like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs program of Radio 4 led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young has taken a few months off because of the disease.
When he appeared in the program for the first time led by Laverne, Daley said that growing up, he felt "less valuable" than others, because "the simultaneous love of boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
He said: “To this day, feeling less value and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed. ”
He said he wanted to prove that there was something worth not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Brown Olympic Medalist has become a loud LGBT community activist and has used his performance at this year's Games of the Nations in Australia to appeal to more countries with the decrimination of homosexuality.
He said that he had decided to express himself because he felt happy to live openly, without any implications, and thus wanted to give others "hope".
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with a man — the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 — “surprised him”.
Daley married the Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, pointing out that such a difference of age was never a problem for him.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and the death of your father because of cancer three years later, saying that it was difficult for him to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple stayed in June with a boy named Robert Ray Black-Nightey. Daley said that his perception of certain things had changed completely.
"The most important thing for me last year was to win a gold medal," he said.
"And you know what? There are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — he wanted to take place in the front row.
“I couldn’t say to him: “You won’t be with us to be in the front row, Dad”, he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing. Only when he stopped breathing and died, I realized he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that this was what I dreamed of my whole life – jumping into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympic Games – it was the best feeling of possible," he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud performed by Heather Small — that accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympic Games, and that continues to give him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
showing no form Mickelson on the bench during the Saturday part of the Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when it plays its 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to work on his form so she doesn't press her heel.
Mickelson, who played for the twelfth time in the event every two years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the time of Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has often been the case in his case on the United States team, the five-time major winner had to spend the day cheering the team and working to improve his game in the hope of fixing the reason for his reference to the bench.
A 48-year-old who never gave up the simplest hits, even at the peak of his career, does not do very well in the tight field of Le Golf National, where wrong strikes are mercilessly punished by long rounds.
And if the field itself is not sufficiently discouraging for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, he must face the precision of the British Open – Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with his debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of the 12 singles) start the game with the vervain, Mickelson's game could prove to be extremely crucial.
Fury expressed his confidence in his player — I don’t think he could have done anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, held my hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He is very confident.
He's in a famous gallery and he's brought a lot to play his bands both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there would be more of them, but that's what happened, and that's what we had to do.
He wants to play like everyone else all the time."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories in his account, 20 defeats and seven drawbacks. Fury said his presence contributed a lot to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, funny, and it's good to have him in the band room," he explained.
“I think the younger players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He's making a lot more than just a game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a high point advantage can soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting the single on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily transform into a difficult game.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in a match on the Valderrama field, where he and the other vice-captain, Sev Ballesteros, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the finish line passed by the shortest of his hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"One cannot forget that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we also had a big advantage in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama we won only for hair," said Bjorn, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave lead 10-6 in Le Golf National.
Time will show me and all the team members that it's not over.
Tomorrow, you're giving your best.
Get out there and do everything right.
The end will only be when the points appear on the board.
We have the goal of winning the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
From the beginning, I said that I focused on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know very well who the people on the other side are – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, delighted to see his players cope in a difficult field, added: “I couldn’t have done it better.
But tomorrow's different.
They start single tomorrow, and that's another question.
It's good to play with your partner when everything goes well, but when you play alone, your golf skills are tested to the limit.
This is the message you have to send to the players, so you give it all tomorrow.
The partner must also give everything."
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to score better on their own than when playing with their partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced great last-day returns as a member of the winning team in Brookline, and then failed after the European team performed "a miracle in the Medinah field".
"I remember every word," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, warmed up to fight his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow, we are playing 12 important games — you would like to start the game at a fast pace, as was the case in Brookline and Medinah.
If this rush goes one way, it'll put a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We've set up our crew properly and set up our boys in a way that would allow us to enchant tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with counterattacking Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team players in the lead half of the program.
"I've decided on this group of guys in this order because I think he's gonna make it through the whole game," said Bjorn about his single election.
New German warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty arrangements and growing at an intimidating rate of costs, as the local media have reported.
The commission of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was moved to the first half of 2019, as reported by the newspaper Die Zeit, referring to the words of the military spokesman.
The ship should be included in the Navy in 2014, but as a result of the problems that emerged after delivery, it was necessary to change this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class units ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, including reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenances — it should be possible to operate the new frigate for up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that these modern warships, which are designed to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete at the start of service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front pages of the newspapers last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the causes behind the return, but the German media informed about a number of key "ware and equipment failures" that made the ship useless in the battle mission.
Software disadvantages were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half as small as the Bremen class's older frigate.
It has also proven that the ship is far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to carry out future modernisations.
It is believed that the 7000 tonnes of the ship Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost of the entire project — including training of the crew — is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a stunning level of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of putting new frigates into use are particularly important in the light of the recent warnings that the power of the German fleet is shrinking.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that "ships capable of use are being terminated".
He also said that this problem had increased over time as a result of the decommissioning of old units without the provision of replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the Fregates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on the property in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at showing how bats use the landscape when they get food.
The results of the research are expected to shed new light on the conservation of these unique flying mammals and will help to target future efforts to protect them.
The research conducted by scientists from National Trust for Scotland will concern dwarfs and minors, as well as brown bats with long ears and bats from the family of Red Nights in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be deployed in key locations around the property to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also carry out field tests using portable detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings is intended to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and how each species behaves.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed in order to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on the landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows and the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the grates and habitat losses.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can fly etchings and some chemicals used in construction materials and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their night - style, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use complicated echoocoholisation techniques to find worms and obstacles in their way.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land all over the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly conduct tests, checks on the bulkhead, and sometimes even rescues.
The organization even founded the first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home for eight out of ten Scottish bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says she's the perfect territory for bats.
"Threave has a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still a lot of unknowns about bats. The work we do here and in other properties will help us to better understand what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of checking the presence of bats prior to the completion of the maintenance work on the estates, as unintentional destruction of one grate can kill up to 400 females and young people, which could lead to extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected — killing them, harassing them, and destroying them is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species we don't even know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while his lawyers intend to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the charges against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published these allegations.
A Portuguese assaulter of Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Friday's reports, Der Spiegel was supposed to pay a woman $375,000 to keep quiet.
Ronaldo (33 years old), a few hours after the press charges were filed, in an instagram live broadcast to his 142 million followers, he referred to these reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's news is fake news," said the five-time winner of the gold ball.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the footballer with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine in connection with the charges they called "unauthorized reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy protection," says Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer would claim compensation for "moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged occurrence was in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at Ronaldo and Mayorg’s nightclub, they reportedly went to the baller’s room where he allegedly raped a woman analyzingly — according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent is a good guy" who had been deceived by this "one percent".
According to Ronaldo's file, he confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and that the hospital had taken photographs of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "feared of retribution" and "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the settlement now because she still can't forget about the alleged incident.
During the alleged assault, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros for it.
Brexit: United Kingdom “always would regret” the departure of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would regret this for all time if, after leaving the European Union, it had lost its world leader in car production, said the Minister of Business Greg Clark.
He added that he was "disturbed" when a representative of Toyota UK told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby would be temporarily stopped.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
A representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of border delays in the absence of an agreement on Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without agreement at the end of March, then production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW is going to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are, as car manufacturers claim, the risks associated with the supply chain when the UK leaves the European Union without agreement.
The Toyota production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU in the case of custom-made cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the border, which, according to industry, may lead to delays and shortages of parts.
As the company representative said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without delivery to its factory in Derbyshire, so production would be stopped.
Clark said that the Chequers Theresy May plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely designed to avoid border control".
"We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best possible agreement, which will not only allow us to enjoy the current success, but also allow us to make the right use of this situation," said BBC Radio 4 in today's programme.
"The statements not only of Toyota, but of other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue what was made up of a very efficient supply chain set."
The Toyota Representation was unable to determine how long production would be stopped, but it warned that in the longer term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a member of the Unite Works Council, said that the members of the union are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are wound up, they will never be restored.
The ombudsman of the Government said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein might be delayed again, as the White House says.
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "lated by another week" due to the ongoing fight for a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, as reported on Sunday by the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possibility of interference of the Russians in the elections, the link between Trump and Russia's close associates, and the potential obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump will release the Deputy Attorney General, threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office on the basis of Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports of his resignation.
The meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not fire Rosenstein, and there was a rescheduling of the meeting to avoid being in conflict with a senate court hearing, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
The spokeswoman Trumpa, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and it may be postponed by another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'm sure I'll let the press know."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
The program leader, Chris Wallace, asked the reason for this.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not caused by reluctance to "ostentatious" TV journalists, and she added: "I will not hide that they are "ostentatious".
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The current President conducts more "questions and answers" than any other president before him," she said, adding, without giving any evidence, "We have become acquainted with numbers".
Press conferences will continue, said Sanders, but “if journalists have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We have tried to do this regularly, and we have done this very often over the last few weeks. Press conferences will give way to sessions where you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or press conferences with host dignitaries.
Salt press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why it is, acting too freely and sometimes strangely in front of the gathered journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from the countries of the European Union employed in NHS Scotland in the face of concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to workers from the countries of the European Union employed in the Scottish health service in order to convey their gratitude to the country and ask them not to leave for Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months until the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of processing applications for "settled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations on the UK's departure from the European Union continued this summer, and the relevant decisions will be taken in the autumn.
The UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat again how much I appreciated the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery due to head trauma
Scoring Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, had an operation due to a head injury in a Saturday match against Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended in defeat with Tennessee with a result of 31-27, informed the organ.
Rod Reed, head coach of the Tennessee State team, told journalists that the player was injured shortly before the end of the first half.
"He came to the sideline and then slipped to the ground," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed him on the stretchers and carried him out to carry out further tests.
The Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no details yet on the type/size of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (student of the second year released from representing universities per year to train his skills) plays his first season in the Tennessee State team after the transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the game, he had five bars, which gives him 18 bars all over the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax charge when buying real estate in the UK
According to the new plans of tories buyers from abroad will be charged higher tax fees for the purchase of real estate in the UK. The funds thus obtained will be used to help homeless people.
This move is intended to counter Jeremy Corbyn's success towards attracting a young electorate.
The increase in tax fees will include those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Treasury expects to receive up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that a higher tax charge will be charged to foreign real estate buyers in the UK, and the additional funds thus obtained will be used to help homeless people.
This move is seen as an attempt to offset Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract the young electorate with promises of cheaper housing and increase the burden on more earners.
Higher tax fees will apply to individuals and non-taxable companies in the UK. Additional measures are intended to help the government fight homelessness.
In addition to the current tax charge, the additional fee charged two years ago, including higher rates for second homes and apartments bought for rent, can amount to up to three percent.
The state expects this move to reach up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and hinders the purchase of the first house or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate, and most of the time they spend outside the country, many rich regions — especially the capital — have become “cities of spirits. ”
The new rules come in just a few weeks after Boris Johnson was called on to cut down on tax fees to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the land, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to abolish the limits of cheap housing in order to eliminate the "domestic scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of rents and the end of the eviction "no reason".
It also wants to give local authorities greater powers in building new homes.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that as Prime Minister, I will be committed to rebuilding the British dream of making every generation’s life better than my previous generation.
This also means repairing our shaky housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy properties here as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become very far away, but the humiliation associated with the need to stay on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to become a Scottish collector"
Sunderland's team coach, Jack Ross, says that his "biggest ambition" is to become a Scottish selector at some point.
This 40-year-old Scotland is committed to healing the North-East Club, which is now third in League One with a three-point loss against the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after he introduced St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player,
but I only managed to get to staff B" - said Ross in an interview for BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“As a child, I often watched Scotland games in Hampden with my father, and I was always attracted to them.
However, this possibility will only come if I succeed as a club coach."
Among Ross' predecessors, Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio were members of Sunderland.
The former Alloa Athletic coach claims that he does not feel intimidated, taking over the role of such prominent personalities in such a large club, rejecting previously the proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The current success will be measured for me if I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Given its structure and the comforts it has, it is undoubtedly its place there," he adds.
"It won't be easy to do this, but I'll probably feel like I've been successful here, only if I can."
Ross’s coaching career lasts only three years. He was a coach’s assistant in Dumbarton and was a member of the Hearts team for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa to re-prove after degraded to the third league, and in the following season he led the St Mirren team from the edge of the inheritance to the championship title.
Jack Ross says he's feeling a lot more comfortable now than when he played Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real turning point,” he says.
“I really believed that running the team was much better for me than playing.
This is going to sound weird, because as a player, I've done well, earned and achieved some tangible successes.
But playing is a tough piece of bread.
You have to go through different situations every week.
They still meet me about the stress and pressure of coaching, but I feel good about it.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing it, and I can say that right now I feel the most on-site in my entire adult life."

Studies show that the best time for beer is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave caused a rapid influx of customers to British pubs, but it had a hiccups in the restaurants.
The study showed that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, who developed the data, says: “The constant heat and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup resulted in the results of July being similar to June, when pub turnover increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the restaurant earnings fell even more.
The fall in sales in restaurants in July, recorded in June, increased even more.
Drinking pubs and bars were definitely the best thing to do, and their sales increased by more than the drop recorded in restaurants.
Food - serving pubs also suffered during the heat, although not as much as restaurant owners.
It looks like people were just thirsty.
The sales of drinks in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month and the food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman of the RSM company, an analysis of the entertainment and tourism industry, says: “These results have been in line with the trend we have been seeing since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting 'outside' consumption remain the weather and large sporting or social events.
The fact that the restaurant networks are experiencing difficult times does not surprise us, although the fall in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences if we take into account the constant pressures on cost reduction.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favorable moment for the owners of food and time restaurants to show whether the slightly more temperate temperatures we had in August will bring the necessary reassurance."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the development of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups with a total turnover of more than £9 billion. It sets recognised industry standards.
One in five kids has secret accounts in social media that they hide from their parents
Studies have shown that one in five children — some at the age of only 11 — have secret accounts on social networks that they hide from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in high school showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” pages
These reports have increased the fear that sexual content is published on them.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “main” account that showed parents
One in five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — set up social networking accounts that they do not reveal to adults.
A survey of 20 000 students in high school showed a rapid increase in “fake Insta” accounts — the name refers to Instagram, where photos can be shared.
These reports have increased the fear that these accounts are used to publish content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students admitted that they had a registered "main" account, which shows their parents and also has private accounts.
One of the mothers who happened to come across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter met a teenager who urged others to "rape her".
A study conducted at independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of pupils aged between 11 and 18 are leading two profiles, half of which are admitted to maintaining private accounts.
The president of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It is alarming that so many teenagers create their places on the Internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
During the annual general meeting of the management of Scottish Athletics Eilidh Doyle, she was elected as a non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most titled Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described this as an excellent opportunity for those who manage sport to benefit from her rich international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a great deal of respect in the Scottish, British and world athlete communities, and we are confident that its introduction into the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm very pleased to be able to give the board a voice to athletes, and I hope I can really help manage sports in Scotland."
An American who, among his four gold Olympic medals, has won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and now regularly appears in the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said time would show if I could get my efficiency back and to what extent.
It was a repentant job, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again, and I went back to practice!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
Advertising of lactators, which compares mothers to cows, stimulates extreme emotions on the Internet
The Lactator company caused a storm on the Internet by publishing an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to milked cows.
In order to announce the launch of “the world’s first silent lacquer to wear under clothes”, Elvie, its manufacturer, published a mocking video commercial that underlines the freedom it provides for mothers.
It presents four real mothers dancing in a hay-filled barn to a song where you hear the words "Yes, I do, but you can't see the tail" and "If you didn't notice, it's not just my tits being replaced."
And Refren goes, "Put them out, pump them out, feed them to the children, pump them out, pump them out, milk your ladies."
The advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook site, caused great controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77 000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them argue that it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that is happening in the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they must become pregnant and give birth to calves, except that their children are taken away after a few days from birth" - wrote one of the users.
Elvie Lactator can be worn unnoticed under the feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is, of course, traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Sure, let's use cows to advertise lactating for mothers who can keep their children."
Someone else added: "This ad is completely detached from reality."
Another defense of the video, one of the women said that she thought the song was “fun. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I'd buy one of those.
I felt like a cow when I was towed.
The ad is a little crazy, but I'm not looking for a second bottom.
It's a brilliant invention," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a funny ad for mothers who drag food (often at work or the toilet) and feel like a cow.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced discreetly with lactators.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many nursing women feel like cows.
However, Elvie's Lactator is completely quiet, there are no cables or tubes and can be worn unnoticed under a feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold children on their hands, and even leave home while pulling food.
Ana Balarin, a partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a brave and provocative premiere.
By putting together the feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges involved in drawing food away, at the same time presenting in a funny and coherent way the amazing sense of freedom that it provides.
It's not the first time an Elvie lactator's ever hit the front of a newspaper.
During the London Fashion Week, during the Marty Jakubowski show, the mother of two children with the product attached.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been secretly transferred to camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border does not really change every month, partly because the severe rhetoric and principles introduced by President Trump's administration have made it difficult to place children in sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being exposed to deportation if they report in for a child.
Such risks increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult persons living on the common holding would be fingerprinted and then transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, an senior official in the agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified to Congress that his agency has already arrested dozens of people who have volunteered as sponsors for unaccompanied children.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested were not previously listed.
“Almost 80 percent of those who are sponsors or live with them in a single household are illegally resident in the country, and many of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That is why we are constantly chasing them," Albence said.
As part of their efforts to speed up the regulation of children, the shelter workers say that officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not 60 days, as was the case with previous standards.
A lot will be presented through videoconferencing, not in person, to ask the immigration judge to legalise their status.
Those who are not eligible for release shall be deported immediately.
According to the shelter staff and the reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become restless or depressed, which in turn may lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempts to escape.
The defenders found that these problems are even more serious in the case of larger centres such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is easier to miss the signals that something bad is happening with the child.
They also added that moving children to a camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to immediately withdraw
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moual, also called for refugees from Syria to return home, even though the war in Syria is already taking place for the eighth year.
Mr Moual, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said.
Moualem claims that "the war on terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue "to wage his holy battle, until the territory of Syria is cleansed" from both terrorist groups and from "all foreigners residing illegally on it".
There are currently about 2,000 American soldiers in Syria, who are mainly training Kurdish and Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Assad and counseling them.
In addition, there are over 1,000 French soldiers in a war - destroyed country.
As regards refugees, Mouale said that the conditions were good enough for them to return, and he accused "some Western countries" of "bringing up irrational fear" that discourages them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help in this return," he said.
"They politicise matters that should have a purely human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad has concluded a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will receive no help to rebuild.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue the political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a large attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province with three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "clear time frame", and expressed the hope that the military action would be targeted at jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaida Front of the Levant People's Defence, who would be "eliminated".
The UN Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to call soon for the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the Governing Party and opposition to draw up a sketch of the post-war constitution of Syria and prepare for elections.
He outlined the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to verifying the records of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would have been elected in 2020 for a second term, unless, as many liberal observers hope, his presidency would have been removed from office and scandaled.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidency final so far".
So far, there's no sign of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the CNN channel’s ratings have doubled over and reached 1.05 million viewers and the MSNBC channel has almost tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, on average 2.4 million viewers are attracted to the highest ratings, which is an increase from 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" has achieved the highest results on cable TV, attracting up to 3.5 million viewers of evening news programs.
"People fly like moths to the fire – this is something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, the lead producer of the ABC series "Designed Survivor" about the secretary of the office who, after the attack on the Capitol, becomes president.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
She mentioned how she drove a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote Trump.
“Why? ” she asked.
“Because he makes me laugh,” he replied.
"Chaos has a entertainment value."
Of course, reports from Washington could, like anything else shown on TV, judge the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of reunification of migrant families or the state of the world economy.
Disengagement is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being a well-informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts debated by Bob Woodward's use of secret informants while writing the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket for $15,000 ("excessively dressed", as The Washington Post described), or the implications of shocking descriptions of President Trump's anatomical details revealed by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again like I used to.
"What he's doing is partly like a reality show in that he delivers new content every evening," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about changing the cast and daily returns of the show Trump (such as attacking the NFL players or praising Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to miss the episode because you're gonna be late.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of the island of Kauai, where he had his home, was beautiful, but he sat inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing in front of the Senate Judiciary Commission and he weighed the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

The inflow of money from outside to the election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganization of the constituency, as a result of which two now in office Congressmen will now stand in a race for one position, the 17th constituency in Pennsylvania flows the cash river.
This recently established suburban district of Pittsburgh represents a representative of the Democrats in Congress, Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the former 12th district in Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The district maps were corrected after the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, which ruled that the old districts were unfairly designated, which gave the Republicans an advantage and was incompatible with the constitution.
The race in the new district 17 began with the fight for the funding of the campaign between the main funding bodies of the party — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning the hair in a widely commented election until the 18th election district, which took place in March.
The Republican has been in this position for over a decade, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this district.
Politicians gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States was considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but they withdrew from this idea
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, despite a slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a warm meeting with President Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until the partners expelled the Trump Organization management team, he had a hotel in Panama.
The officials of the State Department decided to revoke the heads of US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "new decisions to cease recognition of Taiwan", said Heather Nauert in her statement from this month.
However, the sanctions under consideration were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which, according to 2017, received 140 million dollars of aid from the United States, inter alia, to combat drugs and to support development and the economy.
The sanctions proposed to limit financial assistance and the granting of visas to certain persons would be very severe for this Central American country, which is facing high unemployment and a high rate of murder.
As international meetings progressed, the North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity in order to address the conclusions of a similar assembly last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus cutting off any reflections on the sanctions against El Salvador.
The diplomats say that now, at a conference that is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is due to perform, which is a sign of an invitation to the assembly of representatives of the administration.
Three American messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, accompanied by no new severe messages or punishments from Washington.
John Bolton, spokesperson for the White House, refused to comment on the details of the debate that were presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who, subject to anonymity, agreed to discuss internal negotiations.
Their relations have been confirmed by an external analyst from the administration's surroundings, who has also spoken anonymously.
Learn History
Another element is the report by the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, on the possible obstruction of President Trump's justice, as evidence is now available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also examines whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on the American elections.
If Congress's composition changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him in preparation for a re-emergence before the voters, and he may even be tried before the jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not want to suggest that Trump’s downfall — or those in equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic to decide how much longer this can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out the coup against Hitler, if only the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the possibility of avoiding the years of slaughter that followed.
The railways of history revolve around such turning points, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
In front of the Americans, there are now a few such turning points.
What do we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that he offered a secret recording of the president last year and speculated that he was not fit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the account presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed to a Supreme Court judge despite reliable accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we, in the middle of the presidential term, choose the people who will hold Donald Trump responsible for Congress?
If we don't pass these trials, democracy will have a tough time.
However, I believe that we will succeed because of the lessons I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the sabass candles on that table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how could I not look optimistic in the future?"
Norman Eisen, a senior researcher at the Brookings Institution, is President of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, D.C., and author of the book "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Rangers, Graham Dorrans, is looking forward to playing the Rapid Vienna game with optimism.
The Rangers take the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that the victory with the Austrians, obtained after an impressive remission with Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying with the G League of Europe.
Until the 2:2 draw from Villareal's knee injury prevented helper Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result will work on Rangers as a trampoline for greater successes.
"It has done us good because Villarreal is in good shape," said the 31-year-old.
“ We went to this game with faith that we would achieve something, and we won the point.
At the end of the day, we may have pushed them yet, but overall, a tie is probably a fair result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but in the second, we were better.
As for Thursday, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope to score three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent won a good score in his last game, but I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will get through both this and we will win a positive result.
The last year was definitely hard because of everything about my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our own places.
The team's great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Fear of saving a pension spends a woman’s sleep from her eyelids
Although those involved in the survey knew exactly how they wanted to take care of them, few talked about it with their family.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants stated that she had spoken with her spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide, who sells life insurance.
Where do I start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare a family to take care of yourself unless you express your will.
With your advisor and family, discuss where and how you want them to take care of you, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask for help from a financial advisor: It can help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows cash to be paid to cover such expenses, or from your own property, if you own it.
Prepare legal documents: You will prevent this from happening in court.
Designate a trusted healthcare representative to oversee it and ensure that appropriate persons act in accordance with your wishes if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also the employment of a financial representative.
Choose a trusted person because she will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all accounts are paid if you can't do it yourself.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Write down all the information to keep it prepared.
"This is not just about finances, it is about who doctors are," asks Martin.

Who's gonna take care of the dog?

Male repeatedly shot with a windmill in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times from the windmill when he came home from the evening party.
A 40 - year - old boy was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
The police have identified the shooting, which took place around 02:30 hours BST time, as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries don't threaten a man's life.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami that visited the city of Palu on Friday.
Due to the broken communication, the rescuers failed to obtain any information from the Donggala cabupatene, which is located north of Palu, closer to the 7.5 degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from the Palace after the crash.
Here is some of the most important informations about Palu and Donggala kabupatenia on Celebes:
The Palace is the capital of the Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island.
When the earthquake and the tsunami occurred, the city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a kabupaten (an administrative unit with a level lower than the province) stretching along the northwestern coast of the island over 300 km.
It is estimated that 299,200 people lived in 2017.
The main sectors of the economy of Central Celebes are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed in particular on the coastline of Donggal.
Other sources of income are nickel mines, but they are mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to information from the Indonesian Disaster Control Agency in the last 100 years, earthquakes and tsunamis have invaded Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, the tsunami, which struck Donggala, killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, nine people were killed as a result of a tsunami in West Donggali.
Indonesia is located on an active Pacific fire ring, which causes earthquakes to occur there quite regularly.
The largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which struck the west coast of Aceh in the north of Sumatra on 26 December, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226 000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half hit Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and the beginning of April, the West coast of Sumatra visited a series of strong earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, there was an earthquake of 6.8 degrees, causing a tsunami that broke into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 degree earthquake took place near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
It killed more than 1,100 people.
2010: A 7.5 degree earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands near the Sumatra coast. It caused a tsunami wave of up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jay’s kabupaten in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami wave, but the building was collapsing, killing more than 100 people.
2018: Large earthquakes visited Indonesia's tourist island, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
These caused thousands of homes to be destroyed and caused temporary trouble for thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska governor and candidate for the Vice President, Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, from Wasilla, Alaska, 29-year-olds, he was arrested for domestic violence, made it difficult to report and resist arrest.
According to the police report, when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to file a report of a crime, he took her phone.
The KTU reports that Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and has a bond of $500.
According to her information, on last Saturday, he was brought to trial, where he stated in his defense speech that he was "certainly innocent".
There are three Class A offenses on Palina, which means she can be punished for up to a year in prison and $250,000 in fines.
He was also accused of a class B offense, for which he threatened to punish the day of the prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time that Palino's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an attack.
The case is currently taking place before the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, made it difficult to file a report and hold a gun in an out-of-date state in connection with the incident.
His partner says he punched her in the face.
In 2016, a group of veterans criticized Sara Palin, who linked the aggressive behavior of her son to the post-traumatic stress syndrome he experienced during his ministry in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died from the tsunami after the earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a Friday earthquake that invaded the island of Celebes in Indonesia.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not operational, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located to the northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos in the social media showing the moment of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coastline, there were hundreds of people on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held.
Federal prosecutors are demanding capital punishment for a suspect for a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding capital punishment for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, and it is a rare punishment that has not been executed in this state for federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack that took place in October on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, Saipov reportedly used the rental truck Home Depot, which was run by pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notification lodged in the southern district of New York of the intention to demand the death penalty to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "indeed" killed eight victims and "indeed" caused serious injury to the body.
According to the court document, there is a death penalty for both of these charges.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 positions, including eight illegal murder charges — which is usually the procedure used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases — and the charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the organization of the attack required “serious planning and thinking”. The way Saipov carried it out was described as “a monstrous, cruel, and immoral”.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has brought harm, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,” says the announcement.
Five of the victims were citizens of Argentina who were in New York.
For the last time, the death penalty was made ten years ago in the South New York District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers, but finally heard a life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in New York City in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was executed after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, which came from Uzbekistan, there was no guilty conscience within months of the attack.
The police say he told the investigator he was fine with what he did.
According to the record, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS movies he was watching on the phone.
According to the police, he also demanded that the ISIS flag be launched in his hospital room.
The prosecution's record of 22 charges says he's innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys representing Saipova, said that they were "for obvious reasons disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and rejection of life without the possibility of early release after confession will only extend the suffering that these events have brought upon all those concerned," he said.
Saipova's defense team has already asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Parliamentary for Tories says that NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the negotiations on Brexit
During today's protest at the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people".
Former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must "feel hot" from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's parliamentarians suggested that he should take responsibility for the negotiations with the European Union.
A Member of the Conservatives, Peter Bone, told the protestors in Birmingham that if Farage were a secretary for Brexit, "The United Kingdom would already be outside the Union".
However, joining the Tories in favour of remaining in the community in a separate protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, even more stressed the burden of reconciling their deep-divided ranks before Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is trying hard to implement his plan of compromise with the Chequers in the midst of the attacks by the supporters of Brexit, its opponents, as well as the European Union itself.
Its allies argue that despite its opposition it will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Committee to make a choice between its proposal and its "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leavens in Solihull that he wanted to "throw the plan from the Chequers."
He suggested that Nigel Farage, to whom responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels should be delegated.
"If he had done this, we would now be outside the Union," he said.
A member of the Wellingborough added: "I support Brexit, but we must throw away the plan from the Chequers."
In his opposition to the European Union, he said: “This is not why we fought in world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want to exercise our rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that citizens had changed their minds since the vote in 2016: "Think the British changed their minds and wanted to stay in the Union is completely wrong".
The demonstration also included the supporter, Andrea Jenkyns, of the Torys party, who told the reporters: “I am just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy the support of the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists who population the streets and who have chosen us do not support it either.
Drop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In her statement to Prime Minister May, she added: "The Prime Minister maintains his position when he keeps his promises."
Nigel Farage stated that the politicians involved in the demonstration must “feel hot” if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Rexit, and we're here today to tell 'em 'we won't let you do it'."
He added: “I want you to make politicians who are at the edge of the betrayal of Brexit feel warm.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the referendum on Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
During that time, the opponents marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved "Torysi versus Brexit" banners after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, mocked the Conservatives for the security issues of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who claim to be able to organise information systems and all technology to support the Canada plus plan, the liquid border, free trade with Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president.
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, "he will seriously consider running for president."
As reported by The Boston Globe, the government representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a meeting with voters held on Saturday, in Massachusetts, West.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trump, will apply for re-election in November, and her opponent will be the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that Warren can defeat Trump in the 2020 elections.
The Saturday event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters in the city hall since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning on running for president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to repair our broken government — and she also means a woman on the mountain. ”
Arresting the perpetrator of the fatal shooting, where the LSU player, Wayde Sims, was killed
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported the arrest of a suspect in the case of a Friday shooting that killed a LSU basketball player, Wayde Sims.
The police department in Baton Rouge reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at a conference held at 11 p.m. Eastern time.
On Friday there was a video of a shooting asking for help in identifying the man on it.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims died of a gunshot wound near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a firearm, and he died as a result," said the media chief, Murphy J. Paul, according to 247sports.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the crime scene, carrying a gun and shooting at Wayde.
After the arrest, during which he did not resist, he was transferred to the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A 1.98 m junior Wayde Sims was raised in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games, and in the last season he started 10 times, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the floor, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 games per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world's title after the team's command enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's command would have a major impact on the race's outcome.
Bottas, who started from the first field, began very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went down to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to go in the tail of a pellet, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes player went down to the box in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after a wheel-to-wheel action, which led the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the inner part of the track, risking to push the defense after a double-driving rival to defend his position on the third turn, Hamilton stepped up to lead.
Max Verstappen took off at the end of the bet and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap he was in seventh place.
He then ran through a large part of the race because he did not change tires to make a quick finish and pick up Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went down to the service point on the 44th lap, but in the remaining eight laps he failed to speed up.
“It’s been a tough day because Valtteri’s been doing a great job all weekend, and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me through.
The whole team gave their best to take two first places," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
During the meeting held on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein, who claimed that she did not disclose the contents of the letter from Christina Blasey Ford, where she accused her nominee of sexual assault in the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony made by Christina Ford before the Senate Commission on Justice, but stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "wild, mean and lying".
"What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have been witnessing for a few days, when we see anger when we see people who are angry, wicked, mean and lying," he said.
"We see what has been published and revealed, and then they tell us 'Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it to her."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we did not reveal" - he added, passing the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents leaked in early September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's innuendo, I didn't reveal her story," said Feinstein before the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me for discretion, and according to her request, I did not disclose these content."
However, her statement did not convince the president who commented on them during the Saturday meeting: “I tell you, that was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following the defense of a candidate for the Supreme Court, whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats are using innuendo for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power by all means.
You can see meanness, malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take over power and control," Mediaite reported the president.

In a match with Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants team.
The Dundee Stars Club retaliated its Friday-to-day Elite League losing to the Belfast Giants team, winning a reward match at its home on Saturday, 5:3.
The giants quickly gained a two-core advantage after the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan equalized the score, and then Dwyer reinstated the Giants.
Francois Bouchard rebalanced the score by gaining a goal for the Dundee team, followed by two goals fired by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to seal her victory.
It was the third losing in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's caretakers, who, despite the initial loss on Friday night, won the Dundee team in Belfast 2:1.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season, with the giants winning three games.

The host team has been regrouped and Bouchard has rebalanced the score with a goal of 27:37 minutes.
At the end of the second Tuesday, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen to give Dundee the first lead in the game. The final victory of Dundee was sealed in the middle of the last third by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The giants who lost their last five games will play their next game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to help hundreds of people on the plane escape from the earthquake
The air traffic controller from Indonesia was called a hero after he died, helping to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died, and many were found missing after a major earthquake, which struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong secondary shocks in the area. In Palu, many people have been imprisoned in rubble.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the disintegrated flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air airline (Flight 6321), which was just on the runway, had a safe start.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to reports from the Australian station ABC News, Air Navigation spokesperson Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the controller's decision probably saved hundreds of lives.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This message tore our hearts," he added.
However, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths can reach thousands, and the national disaster management agency reports that the possibility of accessing the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the death harvest is increasing, because many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached," said Sutopo's spokesman, Purwo Nugroho.
The tsunami’s six - foot - long waves destroyed Palu, where the victims’ mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian planes provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News Station: “The ambulances are constantly bringing the bodies.
It's starting to run out of drinking water.
Small shops are plundered."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find on the ground.
It's a tragedy, and it could get worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to the army: “I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
This year Indonesia has already been visited by an earthquake that has killed over 550 people on the island of Lombok.
A plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini reports that one person is missing after the plane crashed on the lagoon
Air carriers operating a flight that crashed on a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific are reporting that one person is missing. Previously, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a drowning aircraft.
Air Niugini reported that on Saturday afternoon data could not account for one man who traveled on a private plane.
They made sure that, together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, they were trying to find him.
However, they did not respond immediately to requests for additional details regarding the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island, the rescue of other passengers and crew members helped local boats.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airlines said that there were still six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is unclear what caused the disaster, and it is also unaware of its exact course.
The airlines and the United States Navy claim that the plane landed on a lagoon not far from the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off the belt.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was coming very low.
"This has been very helpful for us," he said.
Jaynes said he managed to get through the water reaching into the belt to get out of a sinking plane.
According to him, cabin crew members panicked and shouted, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who were working nearby to upgrade the coastline were also helping to transport people to shore by means of a blown boat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have been killed in the last two decades in the disasters of aircraft belonging to airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but there are no Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed the events of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. ended up presenting evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Justice Department, Paul Rowlett, testified for many hours as a forensic expert in the analysis of information.
He described to the judges how he re-created the 29-year-old, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
As reported by Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he obtained location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers the night he was born.
When the data confirmed that at a time when Quinton was supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said, "I lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inaccuracy is Tellis' claim that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records show that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact details and texts and calls from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The final defense speech is due on Sunday.
The judge said that probably on the same day the case would be handed over to the jury.
The High Breed — What Is A Conscious Hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the species by filling the music with a positive message.
According to the High Breed Group from Bristol, today's hip-hop has left behind the original political content and social issues.
The team members want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of the conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the works of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, the rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Common has recently been observed in the UK.
Another black?!
Nanny from New York suing a couple for release after a "racist" text message
The New York nanny is suing a couple for her dismissal from a racist background after having received a misrepresented text message in which the child's mother complains that she is "another black person".
The couple are denying that they are racists, comparing the lawsuit to "hancage."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly consistent when it turned out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who had just appeared on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
"NIEEE, A KOLEWN CHRIST," she wrote in text to her husband.
But instead of sending him to him, she accidentally sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post newspaper, when Plasco-Flaxman realized the gaff she had committed, the “committed” released Gisella Maurice, claiming that the loving nanny, who was African-American, was doing her duty badly, and she was also expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs Maurice was paid for the working day and then sent home by Uber.
Now, she's demanding a couple's compensation for a 350-dollar exemption multiplied by six months, originally employed with her place of residence, although she hasn't signed a contract.
"I want to show them that things are not done," she said to the Post newspaper on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the charges of racism, claiming that it was justified to end the cooperation with Mrs Maurice, because after she was offended, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she wasn't going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the Post's husband, Joel Plasco.
"Would you trust your children with a person who is sorry, even if it happened by mistake?
Your new baby?
Come on."
Comparing the suit to "shance", Plasco said that his wife had only been born two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to blow something like that up?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case is not over in court, the public has soon delivered a judgment on a few social media sentences, criticizing her for her behavior and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the books about Paddington were afraid that readers wouldn't feel a connection with a talking bear.
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was warmly adopted, says: “It’s hard to put the person who first read it before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He claims that her father, who, before a little plush bear inspired him to write a book for the children, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was confident that his work would be rejected.
The woman she describes as “a very important member of our family, ” says that her father was secretly proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he did not boast" — he adds.
“However, since Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something — you feel proud of him, although it is not your fault.
I think that's the kind of way that Hintton's success could see.
Even though he invented it and created it, he always paid his dues to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When her daughter landed, she was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"Nad called regularly and said that it was really bad, that it would probably not work out," says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called to say that Natasha would die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that her doctors gave her to keep her heart action slowly stopped working and were eliminated from her body.
She died a while earlier, and it was the end of everything.
All I could do was sit back and wait and see that this was all going on.
I couldn't piss or cry or cry because I was with other people.
I had to really stick to it."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, came aboard with other passengers, unaware of the torment she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
I had my head down, and my tears were running out the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt a ubiquitous sympathy for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Post cards from women in mourning to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide try to drive others away from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring news and phone numbers where people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he got depressed, took his own life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he says.
A 45-year-old Sharon Davis who lives in Lydney tells us that her son was a well-proclaimed cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
They always said he could lighten up every room."
But before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a really black place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis created cards “to tell people that there are people you can talk to and talk to, even if it's just friends.
Don't be quiet. Talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say anything about feeling down, sad or anything," he says.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
By Christmas, he was in a complete hole, and when the kids opened the presents, he even looked at them."
He says that his death was very painful to them, but they had to deal with it: “It takes away a hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in Italy because the FBI is initiating an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get what he asked for, limited in time and limited in scope, perhaps we could achieve some unanimity," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would “break apart” into opposite camps, leading to a deadlock.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
All their reluctance comes from the moment.
The elections to Congress are in a few weeks — 6 November — and if, as expected, the Republicans lose them, the chances of choosing a specific person to the highest court in the country will be reduced.
George W. Bush had already picked up his phone to call the senators and get them to back Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain that Brett Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes from the senators, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim’s rule, the number of refugees from North Korea is decreasing
According to the South Korean legislator, since Kim Jong Un took over seven years ago, the number of people fleeing from North Korea has fallen to South Korea.
Citating data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, Park Byeong-seug said that 1127 escapes were recorded last year and 2706 escapes were recorded in 2011.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more accurate border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by human traffickers.
Pjongyang did not make a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are ultimately proposed South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
The majority of China has escaped, which has the longest border with North Korea, which makes it easier to cross it than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to the country by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they had discussions on the negotiations on deuclearisation, which had previously been at a dead end.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, held in Singapore in June. The result of this meeting is a general agreement to clean up the Korean Peninsula with nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of lack of progress on this issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and under these circumstances we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Ri in the speech he gave before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histery" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh a "history" and said that he was by nature not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave these words during an interview she gave during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday.
"I think that if a woman acted like this, she would be considered a 'histery'," Pelosi said about his reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh had made on Thursday before the Senate Commission on Justice.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied charges of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh showed strong emotions in his opening speech, almost screaming and losing his speech when discussing family and high school years.
He was also clearly acquitted by the Democrats from the committee, defining the charges of a "grotesque and coordinated attack on the reputation" organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she thought Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudice to the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Asked if she would seek the removal of Kavanaugh from office if he had received a nomination and if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also take office in that court where he currently works," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in a district appeal court in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she fears the possible Kavanaugh rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial, because she is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmatory hearing, Kavanaugh ignored questions as to whether he would repeal some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is no time to bring into a hysterical court a prejudiced person who expects us to say 'how wonderful'," added Pelosi.
And women must rule it.
It's a proper diatribe, months and years of fury, and she can't throw it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
"That's quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was a manager at a company helped me a lot, and she said that she was crying when she was angry, but she came up with a way that when she got nervous and started crying, she was talking to the person she's talking to, and I guess you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he's still doing his job.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a part of an absconding anger because they are in principle misunderstood.
One of my more apparent memories of one of the first jobs in a male - dominated office is how I started crying out of unspeakable rage one day, and one older woman, a cool steering woman, who I was always a little afraid of, grabbed my neck and took me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they're happy to make you hot."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a member of the Colorado Congress, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a mistress on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, frustrated to the border Patricia realized that she might actually consider running for president herself.
"It was not a thought-out decision," she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"Seven other candidates were elected and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to this situation as "King Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign had lasted for a long time, Schroeder was behind in fundraising and promised herself that she would not join the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a battle to lose.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, had only 250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts? ” she wondered.
During her speech, in which she announced that she would not be conducting a formal campaign, she was so full of emotions — gratitude to those who supported her, frustration over a system that made it so difficult for her to raise money and turn to voters, not delegates, and anger at sexism — that her voice got stuck in her throat.
“You might think I’ve had a nervous breakdown,” she recalls.
"You might think that Kleenex is sponsoring me.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"Crying?"
What benefits can Beijing’s economic war between the United States and China
The salves starting the US-China economic war were stunning and, although the battle is still ongoing, the long-term conflict between these countries can be beneficial for Beijing, says experts.
The first warning was fired this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on key export goods of China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth 200 billion dollars ($150 billion), resulting in the taxation of half of all goods arriving in the USA from China.
Every time Beijing was returned in nature, it recently increased customs duties on American goods worth 60 billion dollars from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every hit by the US, and it does not appear that the second economy in the world is about to give up.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting demands, but the public bowing of its head to the United States would be too embarrassing for the President of China, Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the US trade war could strengthen China in the long term, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic chaos in one of the countries is in fact much more dangerous than observers have ever been," said Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher in the think tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding a country that has been destroyed as a result of over seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moual, stated that the country's conditions were improving.
"The situation on our territory is now more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
In order to restore normality, the government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been fulfilled for refugees who had to leave the country because of terrorism and the unilateral economic shifts they have aimed at their daily lives and means of subsistence to be able to return voluntarily to it.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million citizens have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept aid under the terms and conditions offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the US team with the result of 16,5 to 10,5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
In Europe, the United States has already lost its sixth in a row and since 1993 has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe.
Europe regained its trophy when, under the leadership of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it gained 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
An American star, Phil Mickelson, who, most of the tournament, did not go very well, hit him with a ball from the stand straight into the water at the 16th hole of PAR3, giving the match to Francesc Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari gleamed through all rounds and became one of four players, who since 1979, when this tournament was the first time held in the current format, managed to score 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by 5&4 by the lowest ranking player from Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world ranking, lost two holes in front of the last hole with the Englishman Ian Poulter, for which it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
A European with the most wins in the Ryder Cup was Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who had already taken part in eight of these tournaments and won 25,5 points of his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm very happy to get the cup back.
It is a success of the whole team and I am pleased to be able to help," said the touched Garcia after winning the team from Europe.
He passes the baton to his compatriot, John Rahm, who on Sunday defeated a single American golf legend, Tiger Woods, as a result of 2&1.
"I feel amazing pride in winning Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game," said Rahm, 23-year-old.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has 13-21-3 scores in the Ryder Cup.
This is an unusual statistic, for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and gave in to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had trouble finding a treadmill all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American team, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I am proud of the boys, they fought.
At one point, we pressed some Europeans this morning.
We're backing out.
Head hats before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for my opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
Yield information — Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota densities of plankton are decreasing
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in plankton density in some parts of the Gulf of Tampa.
According to the FWC, the presence of ostrich flower was recorded in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, suggesting that its density was decreasing.
It stretches to the length of about 209 kilometres of the coastline, from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
The blooms can be found about 16 kilometres from the hillborough county coast, but compared to the previous week in fewer places.
The flower was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, there was an average concentration of plankton off the coast and in the waters of Pinellas, low to medium-sized off the coast of Hillsborough, natural to high in Manatee County, natural to high in coast and in Sarasota County, natural to medium in Charlotte County, natural to high in coast and in Lee County County, and low in Collier County.
In the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, cases of respiratory irritation are still reported.
Last week, however, they were not recorded in northwest Florida.
