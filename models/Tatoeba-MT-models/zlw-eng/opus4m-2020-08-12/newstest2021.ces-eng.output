Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, Skoda also hit
Defender Filip Novák helped with a goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspora to become vice-master.
His team won 2:1 on the field of Kayserispor and held the third Besiktas behind him.
The attacker Milan Škoda, after the January transfer from Slavia, has already scored the tenth goal behind the Rizespor, which has saved himself, even though he has fallen 1:3 on the field of Fenerbahka.
Novák confirmed the excellent productivity of the defender with the seventh goal of this league year.
In 63. minute goalman Kayserispor just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer from an angle hit the ball in the net.
The landlords managed five minutes before the end of the match, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of setting he tore the victory to his side when he successfully finished his four-on-one brek.
The damage at the inception of the second half of the game with Fenerbahce settled after the solo at 1:1.
Rizespora did not keep the indecisive situation for long, but it did not have to regret it, because the results of the opponents left three points over the descent zone.
The competition ends with the Sunday duel of the Basaksehir championship on the Kasimpasy field.
A well-covered cave near a hermit in the woods of New Bor was not actually a resident
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of Lusatian Mountains, not far from Nový Bor, in the forests led by the Count's Road, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Natural and artificial.
And we're going to go after the human hand created.
The place is called the Cave at the hermit.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here, and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely the shelter chamber probably on the grain.
The cave is carved from side to side into a rock cautionary and accessible from top to bottom.
But until the last moment, it's practically impossible to see.
It will be revealed by the narrow stairs leading to a rock gallery, from where it enters the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from human dwellings, at the time of the birth there could be a field on a plateau where there is today a forest.
"The fact that this object does not have a window and even in a traditional location of the heating site clearly shows that no hermit could have survived the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts Jan Evangelista Purkyn in Ústí nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone stand in the back, which is probably used to put the containers down.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or field products," adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are signs of tools on the cave walls.
It was quite simple and fast for the dedication to peel the sandstone.
It was enough to use the clutches appropriately and to peel the sandstone off gradually.
According to the length of the lead mark and even the method of cutting, it is possible to determine the period of the formation of the cave.
According to the historian, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the mess that appears in it, there are times when someone sleeps.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and take interest in you under the cave flowing brook and the nearby Count's Way, you will surely find the path down too.
And on the way out of the woods, you might still be caught by the nearby Raven Rocks.
The jockey Minarik is after a heavy fall in Germany in artificial sleep
"Philip is in the best hands right now.
The Institute is arranged for similar cases, and luckily we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This greatly makes the situation easier and also the care of the daughter of Finju much easier," Kataji quoted the server Horsemen.cz.
"Everybody's doing their best, now Philip needs time to recover.
There's no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered a problem of trauma to their heads and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip's a big fighter.
We must all be patient now and give him time," said the wife of a 45-year-old jockey.
To support the wounded, he called on both twitter and star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh race at Ascot on Saturday, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, balancing the legend of Lester Piggott.
Almost 70 000 euros have been selected on Gofundme.
The objective is EUR 100 000 (PLN 2.6 million).
Video judge took four goals from Sassuola football players, lost 0:2
Sassuola football players got the ball four times in a Saturday game in Naples, but eventually they had to accept 0-2.
None of their goals were recognized by the referee after consulting the video because of the offsadium.
According to the Italian media, it's a record enemy of technology, and VAR has never wasted so many attacks on one team.
"The VAR was more stringent on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him as no team has ever been.
The new technology is breaking records," the newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport commented.
"The festival of unrecognizable Sassuola goals.
VAR has never been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead on Saturday at 8, but after half an hour of the game it seemed that Sassuolo had evened out.
But Philip Djuričich's goal was not recognized after the intervention of a video judge due to the offsadium.
For the same reason, another intervention by Djuričich and by Francesca Caputa and Domenic Berardi did not apply.
The household, on the contrary, added one more goal.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they recharged the most in history
"The growth was extended by both a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and a trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as an accelerated development by the registration of new e-cars," said the head of ČEZ Chmelík's clean technology department.
Other major players such as PRE and E.ON, the manufacturer of Tesla electric cars, as well as Bill and Lidl supermarkets are also reporting their part on the market.
The operator of the classic pump stations is represented by MOL.
She doesn't have the numbers yet.
"Our network for electromobility started only last year," Jana Jusková, spokesperson explained.
However, the diary editor exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
It follows that the drivers from the stations took 13.5 kWh on average.
This corresponds to a distance of approximately 100 kilometres of a smaller electric car.
If we skip the small pumping up to 1 kWh, it takes an average charge of two and a half hours.
The vast majority of the refuelling then took place in a free tariff.
If the motorists had already paid for the collection, their typical spending was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility extends mainly in the capital.
In the territory of Prague there are all five of ČEZ's most demanding rechargers, which overshadow the entire regional cities with their popularity.
The regions are led by Olomouc.
On the contrary, the smallest interest is in a remote station in the border, for example in Bohumína or in Prachatice, which often remains without use throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
Just this first half of the year there were 1274 new e-cars.
In the extensive poll "Czechs on the Move" eight percent of readers stated that they were considering buying electric cars into the family.
However, only a third of the respondents know where to find the nearest charging station.
Not just for better water retention.
In Prague, ecological activists protested
According to the organizers, the government's current steps on issues of protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and resolution of the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more robust approach.
The event called The Last Drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Duha, Greenpeace movement or Greenpeace Party as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people who have long-term anti-enlargement performances at the turkish mine, there are people who are anti-scraping at Uhra Ostroh, there are people who are opposed to the construction of senseless dams," said Marika Volfová as organizers.
She stated that the main demands of the protesters were the creation of a plan for water retention in the countryside, a strong change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies to promote sustainable agriculture and the rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of people, not reckless and devastating business," she said.
The Malostranské náměstí was housed a stand with a petition inviting representatives of the Czech state to settle for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of the Czech soil and landscape.
Present people were equipped with banners with slogans such as "The End of Rape Deak" or "Mint of Coal, More Faces".
Jan Škoda from the Water Association came from South Moravia to Prague for people protesting against the plan to extract gravel sand in Hodonínsko.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that drilling represents the fifth most powerful source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned gravel sand mining is only about 500 metres from the wells, and according to the reports it is certain that water quality will be compromised.
For the so-called agro-ecological farmers came from the village Valeč in Karlovy Vary Vojtěch Veselý.
He drew attention to small farms, which are not married to income and profit, and which supply the population on the spot.
"Small agro-environmental farms are able to feed the entire population completely normally, and on top of that they will not make such a mess of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died in the fall of a plane to a house in Germany
Three people died today in the fall of an ultralight plane to an apartment building in West Germany, and two others were injured.
Local rescues reported that there are likely two crew members and one resident of the house between the dead.
The aircraft crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of five apartment units in the house, subsequently captured the fire.
Firemen have already managed to get the flames under control.
Deputy Commander of the local fire department, Robert Meyboom, reported that both crew members were likely to have died.
According to the police, the third victim is a woman who lived in a house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) with appeal to the mayor of Wesel wrote that it was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was saved with minor injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which apparently served as a landing brake.
The police assume it's from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post reported that the plane had crashed with a hot air balloon before the crash.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, appealing to other Witnesses, wrote that the aircraft had disintegrated in the air before the impact on the ground.
On Saturday, the Czech Savings Company mistakenly charged some payments with a card twice.
Mistake has already been rectified
On Saturday afternoon, the Czech savings company mistakenly charged some payments with a card twice.
According to the spokesman of the bank, Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have affected thousands of transactions.

Problems with double billing of card payments were recorded by the savings company on Saturday afternoon.
"We made an update of the system last night (Saturday) and returned all these double payments to our clients immediately.
At this point, everything works smoothly," said the dot on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank has deducted the money from the card payments twice is not known by the bank spokesperson, according to his estimates it was less than thousands of transactions.
The causes of the savings facility's problems are identified.
"It could have been a combination of more factors," said Dotik.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
She had 4.6 million at the end of March.
The savings fund is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the central and eastern European banking market.
On Monday, Vojtěch will present the three-degree emergency system against Coronavir.
"They will be determined by the power of community distribution at the level of the regions.
We work together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," said Vojtěch in ČT.
These will be so-called traffic, the regions will be marked with green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavir.
The Minister added that the inclusion of individual regions would still be discussed with epidemiologists.
He admitted that at present only the Moravian-Silesian region should have an orange color and Prague would be approaching it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at regional level because the situation in them is not uniform," said Vojtěch.
Watermelon and Carolina
When the waterman Jonah and the miller's daughter Karolína fall in love with each other, they don't have that easy at all.
Jonah's father, the dirty waterman Hasstrbuch, has no idea that her dear Jonah is not human.
Good thing there's a young Libor who'll do anything to protect the whole village, especially Karolínka, from the water villain.
What if he's intrigues and lying?
Especially if she can get Karoline to reject Jonah and prefer him, the valiant Libor.
Soon it is clear to all in the village who is responsible for drowning the evening kettle, corrupt flour, a mill fire and other flounders.
Remarkable villagers will set up a water chase, and Jonah’s head will be struck by an irreconcilable water curse.
Now, Konvic's soul, Karolina, come on!
How do you soften an old Hastruchuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and deliver him from the spell?

The course of the majority disease is mild, only three percent of the infected must go to the hospital
Either the Czech Republic is spreading a milder form of coronavirus, or our summer sun dose has significantly improved our immunity.
The infectious department of hospitals is half empty, even if the infected are growing.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is given mainly by the number of hospitalized people," says the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth noting that on 11 April, when the first wave of epidemics peaked in our country, everyone wore the drapes, collected the army, the Republic was closed and the Czechs consumed the disinfectant for a year in advance.
Yet ten people died a day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected people are higher, but every day covid-19 die up to two people.
The highest number of inhabitants still has Karvinsko, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to an outbreak in the local Alzheimer's centre, where 57 are already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors was closed by a hygiene plant in Černotice, Královéhradeck.
The disease confirmed the tests with one of the nurses.
"We train, we limit movement, we have all the sanitary measures," says the director of the home of pensioners Martin Schánel.
According to him, none of the home's clients have symptoms yet.
Flat-screen tests will begin to be carried out by hygiene tomorrow and will then decide on further measures.
Hospitals also react to an increased number of infections.
The Oncological Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people are wearing a dress at the entrance.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists who have recorded 25 coronavirus cases - most of them are foreign workers of the prophylactic company.
Overall, 131 infected - half the Friday number - arrived on Saturday, but less testing is done.
A debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished a fairy tale, Anderson was grounded
A great surprise tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh demonstrated an excellent performance even in a duel with a player who won the second most prestigious company within the PDC in 2018.
The opening of the match was bilaterally balanced, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian darter.
Van den Bergh married his brother with a 13-shot leg, and he's been on top ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game, and the more experienced "Flying Scots" was hard to get to the doubles.
The way in which "The Creator of Dreams" had it in his hand, shows that the scattered Anderson played his first maximum in 24th leg.
Besides, a young Belgian man was handling great high checkouts.
Last time he lost in his eleventh leg, in a bad condition, but "he caught a big fish" and shut down 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson saw a lot of frustration.
He was rather throwing the darts away, and his triumphant opponent was acting completely sovereign.
Van den Bergh turned the first of the three match darts and kept his name - he wrote his big dream.
The profit of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian darter to be his first winning major.
So it continues to be true that the last player who managed to beat Bergha's van day is Karel Sedláček.
Nantes was charged with a cathedral fire, a man confessed.
St. Peter's and Paul's cathedral in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday, and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th century window and destroyed the organ.
Suspects of arson were investigated by investigators for the fact that the fire proceeded through a temple from three different places.
At the same time, the police found no sign of forced entry into the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a 90-year-old Rwanda refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating a criminal prosecution.
Now the D.A. has informed that, based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faced arson charges.
If found guilty, he may be in prison for up to ten years and a high fine.
According to his lawyer, a man regrets the act and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present a "seafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is designed to fulfil the role of a pandemic plan, which is the absence of which the government and the Ministry of Health critics face.
"They will be step by step according to the power of community distribution," the Minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian region or Prague would reach a medium, orange grade.
The system is designed as a regional one, since the situation in the individual regions varies significantly, it has added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be taken, whether it is an obligation to wear drapes or to organise special departments in hospitals.
The Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for an epidemiological plan to be set up on the Prima Party TV series, according to which people should have clear information on what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation gets worse.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented on this by not talking about the announcement of an emergency or the reunification of a crisis crew.
In view of the increasing number of infected people from Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has once again introduced an obligation to wear drapes at internal events of over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now there are 1,000 people.
The government's procedure, when it was not clear until the last moment, what measures and when they will start to apply and when they will be announced, was followed by criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is rather tense, the main factors should create a sense of certainty and even the confusion," said Senator Marek Hilšer.
The measures may already vary according to the region, for example, from Sunday in Prague, the obligation to wear dresses also in non-residental medical facilities, i.e. in pharmacys or waiting rooms at the doctor's office.
The obligation to wear dresses when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies has been introduced since Friday also in the Liberec and Ústecký regions.
In the Highlands of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear drapes in internal public spaces, public transport and health facilities from 14 July.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian region, anti-epidemic measures have released, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called "Smafor for Europe", which colorly distinguishes the level of disease risk in individual European countries and adjusts the rules applicable to the entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
Since 15 June, the authorities do not require or require a negative test for the coronavirus for Czech citizens from low and medium-risk countries.
These are mandatory when the Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At this moment, all EU Member States are in a low-risk category.
The technoparts in Benesov continue.
Plays a third capacity, ends at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešov) Technoparty at Hlaváčkova Lhota in Benesov continues on Sunday evening.
Still playing a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to evening estimates, the police remain here after 20:00, with about 500 people, the original gross estimates talking about 300, the morning being 900, said police spokesperson Lucie Nováková.
Originally, she had a technoparty to end on Sunday at noon, and at that time, some of the music systems were actually silenced.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
Music production is partly ongoing.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and disassembly of music systems," Nováková said.
"Policemen are still consistently checking out departing visitors in order to prevent driving drivers under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
The event is supervised by dozens of police officers of order units, foreign police, traffic and order police, and there are also dogs with service dogs on the standby.
"During the day, the police checked 470 people moving at the scene of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of which sat behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 police drivers tested the presence of narcotics and psychotropics, one of which was positive.
The police also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the participants, the police carried out 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotics and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants hadn't decreased, the police would have hit it.
On the TV series Prima Party, the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said it.
However, the number of participants decreased below 1000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, and neither did the health service or the health department ask for it.
On Sunday, Czech TV (ČT) reported that the technoparts spread to nearby land whose owners disagreed with the use of the technoparts.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation.
The tech supporters in the meadow at Hlaváčka's Lhota arrived on Friday night.
The police originally guarded the meadow in Blažimi, Benesovsk, where the technoparty took place last year.
Blazim is located about 30 kilometres from Hlaváčka Lhota, where the engineers eventually went down.
According to Novak, no one came to Blažimi.
The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"This year's first case was recorded in Ironnorud.
The viper bit the girl in her leg, the year 2010, which the parents brought to the emergency service base there themselves," said the Regional spokesperson of the Maria Svobodová Medical Rescue Service, who then moved the child to a hospital in Klatovy.
Viper is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in Sumava that these animals occur in a higher number, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance of a viper pokes you isn't too high, she's afraid of normal contact.
And if there's room for it, she likes to crawl away for a loud soak.
They only attack if they feel very threatened - for example if you accidentally step on them.
Even her bite is not a tragedy, but her poison is very effective against small mammals, but people will not die.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weak organism or has an allergy.
The risk is therefore primarily in children, seniors and allergics.
"Man often feels sick after he bites, sweats, has increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, weakened individuals and especially allergics may experience anaphylactic shock," she described for Deník Miriam Gredová from Klatov hospital.
A man threatened to throw babies out the window.
After a cop, he was pouring wine and throwing dishes.
After 11:00, the task force entered the apartment and arrested the man.
The infants were immediately taken over by health care professionals, said the spokesperson of Regional Police Markéta Janowska in the press report.
The man didn't want to cooperate with the police, throw dishes, knives, or pour wine out of the window after the negotiations.
During the negotiations, he strengthened his threats several times by leaning out the window with a child in his arms.
One day, he even climbed up on a window window silling.
The police are still investigating the man.
He doesn't want to publish any more information yet.
Stosur will prefer her daughter before the tennis season
The Australian tennis girl Samantha Stosur will no longer act in the Coronavir of the affected season this year.
A 36-year-old US Open 2011 champion who became a mother in June, but she doesn't want to quit her career yet.
He's planning to go back to court next year, and he believes he's going to enjoy tennis even more thanks to his family and daughter.
Stosur announced two weeks ago on social media that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to Genevieve's daughter in mid-June.
"I'm gonna stay home, spend time with my family, be with all those small milestones that Evie's going to be living through in the next six months, and I'm just going to enjoy it," said the former world leader in four games on the Australian Union website.
The WTA Tour will renew the intermittent season of August 3rd with an aerial tournament in Palermo.
Market Sapa: Razie revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the Assassin plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the stand with live fish, it was found that the seller had no proof of origin and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from the veterinary point of view in the long term.
Last fall, for example, veterinarians discovered an illegal food store, with almost half a ton of unmarked foods without proof of origin.
Most were unable to determine the date of consumption, part of the products had passed the shelf life and was corrupt.
For five kilograms of sépia, the durability date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians with policemen in the market area arrested 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin was on the phone with Zelensky before the ceasefire in Donbas, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where the new ceasefire is due at midnight.
Putin, according to the Kremlin statement, criticised, inter alia, the Ukrainian Parliament’s decision to hold local elections; Kiev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight at night on Monday, to be "complete and universal" and to open the way to comply with the other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin, in an interview with Zelenski, said that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospect of a settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the upcoming elections to local councils would not take place in the territory of the pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the Ukrainian border of occupied separatists with Russia after providing broad autonomy to these regions and holding local elections.
According to the Green Office of the Union, the two states agreed on the benefit of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbas and on the need to take further measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining areas of combat or withdrawing part of the units from the front.
Zelenskyy also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, in the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement helped to stop fighting, but on both sides of the front people are still dying in occasional shootings and artillery attacks.
The Donbas conflict has claimed more than 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West are accusing Russia of military support for separatists, which Moscow is denying.
Zelensky has made the end of the Donbas war his priority, but a major breakthrough in negotiations has not yet been achieved.
The unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykl.
Defender of the last two titles Doležal did not finish the Saturday program 400, Kopecký did not jump the base in the pole on Sunday.
The Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing for coach Joseph Karas, long ruled the decade, but he resigned after the discussion.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor MCR so far, this time he was the only ten-fighter who got across the seven-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-th-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-th-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-th-thousand-th-thousand-th-thousand-th-th-thousand-th-th-th.
Other medals were won by William Straský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, he reminded Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora of the absence of the competition.
"It's a shame the boys weren't here, and he didn't start Kope, 'cause that would look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, and I appreciate the fact that I've had a person 30 centimeters away.
Then I was pleased by the stick and I was most disappointed by the disk, there I was underaverage," he admitted on the union facebook.
On the first day of the seven-fighting she won with more than one hundred-point predominant Kateřina Cachová, even though she was troubled by her wounded ankle on the reflection leg.
In the remote sector, however, she wrote only 570 cm, she didn't change 40 meters with a spear and she didn't make it to the final eight.
Novotná scored 5878 points and won 241 points in front of Katerina Dvořák.
Its distance came out above all, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630s.
Yesterday, my calf started pulling, but I am so glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotna said on the union facebook.
Bio LPG arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
liquefied petroleum gas, a short-lived LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
In particular, it is popular for its substantially lower price than gasoline or naphth, given significantly lower excise duties, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer.
Like gasoline and diesel, it also has its eco-friendly variant - "bio LPG".
But it is quite new - it first appeared on the European market last year and arrived in the Czech Republic according to a press release of the Czech LPG association a few days ago.
"These days, we received the first 15 tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our petrol station in a mixture with the classic LPG fossil," quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
However, Bio LPG cannot be considered as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the Association, it is chemically consistent with the classic LPG oil, which a number of motorists are refueling to their cars now.
It is therefore also possible to mix both versions at any time.
"The only difference compared to the classic LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, Chairman of the Association, about the bio LPG.
This is also said to be one of the major advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, as well as the distribution infrastructure is quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
This gas is currently produced as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from residues of food and cane.
In the future it should also be produced targetedly, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. wood waste.
By contrast, the classic petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly by separation in the extraction of natural gas.
As a result, depending on production technology and sources, the operation of the vehicle on the bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on the LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
But it is not CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, it is about the ecology of the production of the fuel, i.e. the "well-to-tank" (Czech "from source to tank").
One of the largest manufacturers of bio LPG is currently petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Net Mobility Action Plan (NAP ČM), Unipetrol also examines the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refineries.
According to estimates of the Association in the Czech Republic, about 170,000 vehicles travel to the LPG; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher number in NAP ČM, approximately 200,000.
According to the Ministry of Transport's statistics, almost 6,000 LPG cars were converted last year only.
Refuel the LPG in the Czech Republic is possible at approximately 950 stations of different operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, number dropped by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers infected with the Coronavirus virus.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number on Sunday afternoon dropped from Saturday 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 less infected.
Currently there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"The increase in the number of healers is the revision of data, which has not been able to update the hygiene recently," said the head of medical statistics Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were infected in the Czech Republic, 11 419 were healed and 371 Covid-19 diseases unfortunately died.
Mobile electoral units or correspondence.
Political scientist and sociologist were looking for variants for the pandemic period
According to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), there is a need to change the law to vote in the October regional and Senate elections.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He did it on Sunday at the Prima TV Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with the representatives of the parliamentary parties at the Ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral bill," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find a solution under the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister stated that it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law under which people in quarantine cannot vote for health reasons.
The prohibition of voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated on the OVM that the possibility of correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
The current bill, which is in the House, is then based on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
Prokop also considers the concerns of YES or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather record it to other types of parties) from the correspondence election overestimated.
Personally, it is against the possibility of an electronic vote, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now it is necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (choices) that could be carried out already this year and with as little health risk as possible.
It considers it the main thing to be prepared for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
The corresponding choice (whether in foreign or also in the Czech Republic) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
He also sees the electoral units mentioned above or the possibility of a family vote.
He added that it was possible to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of the Coronavir - were addressed in Croatia, Poland or France.
Because of the spread of the coronavirus disease, various types of elections in 67 countries have already been postponed this year.
protests in Buharsk: protesters threw pig ears at the government building
Participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojek Borisov and his cabinet have thrown pig ears on the building of the government.
It was another series of protests against the "Mafian style of governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a national blockade at the center, reported the DPA.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th day of the following day, according to the station Radio Free Europe/Radio Svoboda had a weaker turnout than the previous one.
About 300 people gathered at 20:00, some streets had to be closed for transportation.
The demonstrators in front of the government building performed a theatre scene in which they symbolically locked Prime Minister Borisov in the prison cell and Attorney General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers of President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the basic requirements of the protesters.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health reform and the end of corruption in the construction of the Black Sea Coast.
The organizer of protests Nikolai Hadjigenov today stated in public radio that on Wednesday he is going to "peak the height of escalation" in the form of a "national demonstration in Sofia and the blockades throughout the country".
He reiterated the request for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the termination of early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has already said that he is not going to resign.
This was justified, inter alia, by the need to implement Bulgaria’s pandemic covidu-19 and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he exchanged five members of his government team, although he did not calm the protestor's retreat.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov's government has endured the parliamentary vote on trust in Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mikajlovič doesn't want games without the audience anymore.
Football coach Boloni Siniša Mikajlovič has had enough games of the Italian league without the audience.
The Serbian coach hopes that since the new season fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're currently operating here is not football.
I'm sick and tired of playing games without the audience.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
The fights are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible, and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks so," said Mikajlovič before today's game against Lecce.
After the Coronavirus breaks follow the series A games in a fast sequence, and even though they play until the evening, their players are exposed to heat.
"We play in terrible heat every three days.
They don't even know how the teams are under these conditions.
It's time for this season to end.
The measures had to be taken to complete the competition, but I hope that fans will be back from September," said the coach who had led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
This season is also extraordinary for Mikajlovič because he missed the bench for four months because of the treatment of leukaemia.
"In spite of my illness, the league's break and everything else has managed to move our team up.
We want to keep growing and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of the cyberattack of foreign states, claims Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials reported that the fire that broke out this month in the underground nuclear operation in Natanz could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
The spokesperson of Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abbas Musavi, told journalists according to Iranian media that the Islamic Republic’s infrastructure is facing "thousands of cyber attacks" daily.
He added that it was not a new phenomenon and that most of them could be reflected.
In the past few months, Musavi said that several wider cyber attacks, which according to the analysis were "certain governments and groups".
However, according to Reuters, he did not report any more details of possible perpetrators.
He also added that fires in the woods, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An article by the Iranian State Agency IRNA this month discussed the fact that Iran’s enemies, like Israel and the USA, could stand up for recent incidents.
But none of these countries were directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militants attacked the US embassy in Tehran and held the hostages of 52 Americans for 444 days.
Long-term tensions between the two countries increased in 2018 after Washington resigned from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and introduced sanctions against Iran which have a hard impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the American army killed Iranian General Kasem Solymani and a member of the leadership of Iraqi militia Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
Iran then fired a number of missiles at the base in Iraq on January 8.
The U.S. has admitted with distance that dozens of American soldiers have been injured.
Israel considers Iran as its primary enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran is denying.
TPCA's car has extended its production outage, now until 25 May
The Cologne car manufacturer Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) again extended the production break due to the coronavirus.
Production lines should be restarted on Monday, 25 May in the morning.
The course will be accompanied by dozens of sanitary measures, said the spokesperson of the car company Tomáš Paroubek.
The production is due to the coronavirus pandemic from the evening of March 18th.
Originally, the company planned to restore it on Monday, May 18th.
The reason for the extension of the break is according to Paroubek closed borders and closed dealership, so cars have no one to sell.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the start, i.e. two shifts.
Koronavir is affected by key company markets such as Italy, Great Britain or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (A change for Kolín) said that a stop in production at TPCA is not signed on to city life.
"At first, it was empty in the city.
But the streets are gradually filling up, especially from Monday, when it's very loose.
So the city is full," said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed at the hostels.
"In the last two months, we didn't have to solve any problems," said Kaspar.
For example, the Mladnaboleslav Škoda Auto, which also interrupted production due to the coronavirus crisis, restored it on Monday, 27 April in all three production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the races work at 100 percent capacity.
More than 80 sanitary measures were accompanied by the renewal of the production in Scotland.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the production was restored, the third night shift took place.
TPCA currently employs around 2500 people and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time an employer in Cologne.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to the family
For more than two years, she'd been fighting cancer with Gemma Sisson, and when she seemed to beat the cancer, the disease came back.
In the end, a 39 - year - old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a hospital bed where she could still take her life’s love.
Unfortunately, the disease has fallen.
A few hours after he died, a shocking message appeared on her social networking account for the loved ones.
Gemma Sisson, from the English Leeds, loved bodybuilding.
With a friend of Ricky Moore, who lived with her for over 16 years, she traveled through competitions all over the world.
Ninety-nine-year-old woman was athlete and living healthy, yet in April 2018, cancer was diagnosed.
Gemma began exhausting treatment, radiation therapy, hoping to recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma seemed to be able to win the cancer, but in August 2019 the cancer returned and this time it attacked the spine.
According to the British daily Daily Mirror, a culturalist and personal trainer underwent a 10-hour spinal surgery and then started drastic treatment again.
Everything was futile, of course.
At the beginning of this year, on her 39th birthday, the doctors told her that she had a few months to live.
In April, a handsome blonde decided to join a pub in Leeds, where her family visited her at any moment, who even arranged a wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma for the last time on their two-month anniversary at the restaurant.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after she died, there was a post Gema wrote for her family on her social network account.
"If this has been published, it means that I have finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I cannot thank Ricky enough, who was by my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network, saying that pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on the social network," she wrote, saying, "Everyone should appreciate his life and live it to the fullest.
Art machines sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, the passing pocket work will be won by most of the beginning Czech artists.
Images and other creations create directly for artmata, so they know in advance that they have to fit in size 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package there is always a curator's text about the artist and then the work itself," said the curator of the project Petra Widžová.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
So the buyer can be surprised at what kind of art he gets.
Currently, he may become the new owner of the fantastic illustrations of Alexandra Kostplová or the mini-views from Teresa Bonaventure, which can be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in cooperation with Dora Dutková, prepared a pexeso associated with the walk of Prague.
The cards must be paired with the household signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliana Chom sell pocket packages of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the troupe and the fortuneteller card, the second series of illustrations based on her comic of the Spiritist.
Health pay will increase by up to five percent next year.
The bigger increase is unrealistic according to Vojtěch
Salaries in health care could increase by up to five percent next year, said Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for YES) in Václav Moravce's Questions on Czech Television.
The union demand of up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficiency in providing protective equipment.
According to him, the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that the increase (pays) may be somewhere up to five percent," said the Minister.
According to him, the current situation should be reflected in the choice of the coronavir insurance pandemic and the government regulation against its spread from March to March.
The income of the insurance companies fell at that time.
"A 15 percent increase at this point would be unrealistic," said Vojtěch.
The average monthly salary of the physician in acute bed care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, sisters 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the salaries of nurses in state hospitals and the wages of other founders will be up to CZK 7,000.
It is also apparent from the data of the U.S.A. that the decline in nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic in 2019 was CZK 34 125 according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
As early as June, trade union representatives said that they would require a minimum increase of 10 percent for 2021, ideally by 15 percent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be guided by pay tables, and contractual wages in urban, regional or private hospitals.
They therefore also require that pay tables be uniform for health care professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to CZK 7,000 a month.
For example, doctors’ wages grew faster than wages last year.
According to the president of the Czech dentistry chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unions should see how the state is currently doing.
The House recently approved an increase of CZK 500 billion in this year's government budget deficit due to the impact of the Covid epidemic, of which CZK 1.75 billion is to be paid by health professionals in hospitals and social services.
The Council of Health Care Providers according to Šmuller disagrees with the flat-rate increase in salaries next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by hospitals and health care establishments themselves, and the extra money should go to them through the payment order.
Vojtěch also stated that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
This week, Pavel Švagr, President of the State Reserve Administration (SSHR) said that the administration does not currently have one protective medical device.
He's waiting to complete the selection procedure.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-contained as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
The soldiers could take over by the scrubbing clever quarantine.
We're ready, they're calling.
"Smart quarantine works, is something to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly, and the question is whether they should not be managing the whole thing again," said the Prime Minister on Sunday on his Facebook show Hey people.
According to him, IT systems and sanitary stations are not sufficiently connected, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were according to the Prime Minister in the Moravian-Silesian region, where one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic are.
DOD spokesman Jan Pejšek for CTK stated that he does not have information on Sunday meetings and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, a clever quarantine was conducted by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body of the government, led by former Deputy Minister Roman Priymula.
The profane project was criticised by the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on Sunday.
He also said that the army could take him back.
Weaknesses in the project had previously been admitted by the government's IT Agent and the digitization of Vladimír Dzurilla, who was in charge of him.
"The system works, but it's still working.
It's been independent and unsystematic for 20 years, and now we're trying to unify it in a few months.
It's not a jet.
The people behind the march, the poor in the hygiene after the march adapt the new systems and actually pick up the mistakes," he said.
Mayor Macura of Ostrava won't run again, because he doesn't want to "go crazy in politics"
The current Ostrava mayor Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is to "do not fool around in politics," said Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the Bureau of the ANO movement, has been Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, the leading candidate of the YES movement in Ostrava received almost a third of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in office only for four years.
"I thought I'd stand up for one term of office, and with the business experience, I could turn everything around and put it on my feet," he said.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent for the second term of office.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics," Macura said, who in an interview called himself a heavy introvert who doesn't like frequent contact with people.
According to the Respect, Macura has been speculating about the possible end in the YES movement for a long time.
The server recalls that Macura has criticised the ANO movement several times, for example, for alliances with the SPD movement or for supporting Milose Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few personalities, YES supported the election of Zeman’s opposing candidate Jiří Drahoš.
Macura is not planning to leave the YES movement, which entered in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change things in the movement, that this is not a completely futile fight, and that no one is going to mess with it, I have no immediate motive to end it," he said.
He graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming Ostrava's Mayor in 2014, Macura served as, inter alia, the director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat in the bodies of other companies.
Uber offering transport services will return to Brno
Uber will return to Brno at the end of July, offering transport services.
This is a consequence of the amendment of the law, said Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) in the press release of the city councillor Brno on Thursday.
Uber was protested by taxi drivers in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as the marking as taxi or taxi meter.
However, the conditions for operating normal taxis and alternative taxis have changed since July.
In the last few weeks, Mr. Kratoch has held several negotiations with Uber representatives.
"On their basis, the company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year with its services.
This step is a consequence of the amendment of the law which allows this company to carry out its activities legally.
The city has been introduced to this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
The taxi drivers protested against him for not marking vehicles as a taxi or a missing taxi meter.
The court issued a preliminary measure prohibiting Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but last year, Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later decisions of the courts, Uber could ride in Brno, but the company did not use it.
Now it will return on the basis of a change in the law.
As of July, in addition to classic taxis with a lamp and a taxameter, the transport service ordered and paid exclusively via mobile applications can be more easily operated.
Too big a celebration in Brno: flying chair landed a meter from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew out of the fourth floor of the apartment on Saturday evening in Brno and landed approximately a metre from the sidewalk.
He was followed by a pedestrian who immediately called the officers.
The guard noticed an open window immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, under which chairs were still lying and several cans and nails next to it.
"The movement from the room on the fourth floor suggested that there was a rather noisy celebration inside.
The officers went to the apartment in the hallway and asked three young men from the age of twenty-six to twenty-nine for an explanation," said the spokesperson, Jakub Ghanem.
The requirement for the appeal of Rafai will be discussed by Babiš and ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) is planning to discuss a request for the appeal of the head of the Antitrust Office (ÚOHS) by Petr Rafaj on Monday with coalition social democrats.
To appeal, Rafai was called upon by nonprofit organizations to meet the anti-corruption council of the government and also by the Ústice region.
The Social Democrats state that the exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to information, CTK Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term of office ends in the middle of next year, under the law, he cannot be appointed for the third time.
His appeal is within the competence of President Milose Zeman.
In addition to the challenge of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústecký Region.
Rafai's case of recent times, among other things, is due.
In the last week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the request, with the fact that the materials were introduced and that the government parties would take a "some opinion".
He also stated that he had not yet dealt with the challenges with the President, he had no appointment with him in the near future.
According to the UOHS, there is no reason to appeal because Rafai was not accused of anything.
IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz servers have written in the past week that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with Chief Commander Jiří Čunk.
The meetings were linked, among other things, to the decision-making of the project of controversial new zlin hospital for eight billion, which Čunek strongly advocates.
Chunk admitted the meeting, according to him they were working together to solve his "senate activities".
Rafai also speaks the same way.
The Ustecky Region Representation called on the government to appeal Rafai at the end of June.
It also asks for reform of the Authority's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the UOHS regarding public procurement, according to Deputy Chief Transport Officer Jaroslav Komín, is not transparent and has signs of rebellion.
In March last year, the police interfered with the antitrust office for a toll tender.
In June this year, the server Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafai is using apartments written on the company of the influential background player ČSSD Alexander Čuba.
But the deposit of 3.5 million for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafai's account.
Rafaj has been President of the Office for Competition since 9 July 2009, for the second term of office of the former Member of Social Democracy appointed by the President in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafai's second six-year mandate expires.
The Antitrust Office Act states that the President may dismiss the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it has not served for more than six months or has seriously undermined the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of its office.
Employees in the Blane Library were collapsing with heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
Three children and I go to a library in the center of Blanska regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was virtually impossible to stay there.
It was awful hot and bad air.
Winding didn't help.
That's why I'm happy for the air conditioning," said one of the Blanen readers Petr Novotný.
According to the head of the library of Lukáš Propa, the temperature of the building was often more than 30 degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and in sunny days it works as a greenhouse.
"In addition, the sun resists much of the day thanks to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a great problem for the individual department to ventilate, because the windows must be closed overnight for security reasons.
Often we have been in the library to 30 degrees since morning," said Propa.
The worst part was the study room and the reading room on the third floor.
And a floor higher, the exhibition room and the principal.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes it happened that the librarians collapsed at work and ended up in incompetence.
The problem was also regularly encountered in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, you couldn't breathe in there," said Prop.
Originally, the city's representatives wanted to do air-conditioning in all the library premises this year.
In the end, there'll only be three of the five.
"For limited funding, air conditioning will only have the most difficult spaces.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
In addition, the cultural room and the children's department are a floor higher," Jiří Svoboda of the Blane investment department informed.
He added that in the first stage, workers had already installed air-conditioning and modified the wiring in the above mentioned space last fall.
Approximately $360,000.
Blansko City Library has nearly three thousand registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
Chicago's support has driven out the coronavirus.
Crawford back in the game
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it is a NHL player who keeps quiet about the health of players as a grave and publishes nothing at all.
As one of the few, he stepped out of the Crawford series.
A 35 - year - old native from Montréal was only present at the first training, since he was missing the lineup.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positively for Covid-19, and for that reason I have spent the last 14 days locked up in my house," he revealed the reason for his absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his condition anymore.
Crawford is ready to hurl again into full load.
"It's amazing to be back.
I will do everything I can to get into shape as soon as possible," he added.
Experienced goalkeeper has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a firm part of the goaltending is already the tenth season in a row.
Blackhawks is waiting first for a preparatory duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in front of them.
Thousands of people protested against the Prime Minister in Israel
Thousands of Israelis in several places have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tackles the coronation crisis.
The Manifestation took place, among other things, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near its official residence or in a park in Tel Aviv.
The protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants demand the resignation of Netanyahua because of the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government is dealing with another wave of coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," wrote one of the demonstrators, according to AP, on his transparency, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the Emperor has lost his dress," it was on another.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is the first Prime Minister of Israel to be tried in the performance of his duties.
Accused in three counts of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He rejects all charges and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial may last up to three years, calling over 300 Witnesses.
The SARS-COV-2 Coronavirus, which has about nine million inhabitants in Israel, has been confirmed with nearly 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the disease.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March to help reduce the daily increase of the infected.
However, after the gradual release of the restrictions since the end of April, the number of infected people began to grow significantly again at the end of June.
Netanyahu’s critics argue that the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, traders affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters also regret the fact that the government issues conflicting instructions in the fight against the Coronavir.
The driver broke the car into a tree and died.
The body must have been cut from the wreckage by firemen.
The tragic accident happened around 23 o'clock at Nevkovo's narrow district leading from the Slapská dam.
The driver flew probably at a slow speed down into the woods and broke the car against the tree.
He died at the scene.
The body was forced out of the wreckage by firemen, including cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are checked by the police.
They ordered an autopsy to clarify, among other things, whether a man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and gnashing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and starts with a major change of strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to churn one collection after another.
The fact that fashion industry is one of the largest environmental polluters is not new.
That's how billions of clothes end up in the incinerators and landfills every year.
A look at a slow fashion, often despised approach to dress, but has changed quite quickly over the past few years.
Approximately half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at a full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, is not just going to buy.
The company does not want to churn one collection after another and at the end of each season to cheap the products at their production price.
In addition, according to the owner, Michal Mička is away from the times of new and old collections and blind follow rapidly changing fashion trends.
"Most dealers with discounts count already when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
It's actually a bit of a scam," says the owner of Pietro Filipi Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Every product of ours is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We place emphasis on making a large part of our collection made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that is timeless and super-seasonal.
Worldwide, the premium brand segment is the absence of any discount typical, the product price simply corresponds to its quality, so there is no need for a discount," says Mička.
The giant graffiti represents the air carrier RAF Kurt Taussiga
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal pleased the city management," said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
He used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp where he was held for several weeks because of his Jewish origin.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton’s organization, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp.
In 1939 Taussig entered Great Britain, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then underwent pilot training in Africa's South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Sixty-four-year-old Kamil Vacek, whom people in the street graphic arts industry have known under the nickname Camo, has been working with spray in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the surfaces, which for these purposes was allocated by former Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
The storm Hanna has reached the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on Saturday afternoon of local time (before midnight SELČ at night for today) on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas.
The island of Padre Island hit Texas, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and in the course of its movement over the mainland, it weakened to a tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
He brought with him strong winds and intense rainfall; according to AP, outages of electricity and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported along with local floods.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has already declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in the southwest of Texas on Saturday and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was given to people from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total it has the element to hit the territory of nearly 500 kilometers long before it gradually moves over North-East Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, there can be strong rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous tide and a unique tornado pose a threat," warned the American National Hurricane Centre (NHC).
This morning, the local time (afternoon SELČ) storms moved in the area of the American-Mexico border, accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic region on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometres per hour during the course of the course, which removed Hanna from the hurricane category.
Local authorities have called on the storms to survive at home without forgetting the sanitary measures associated with the prevention of the spread of the coronavir.
Texas is one of the American states that is suffering most from Covid-19 disease pandemics.
Given the current security measures and the need to comply with the distances, they are a major challenge and possible evacuation.
Provisional shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Hidalgo district of Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as shelters after evacuations, who had a positive test for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have called on everyone evacuated to take the drapes and disinfectant gels with them, if possible.
"We don't even have it yet.
We are expecting catastrophic floods," said AP Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts say that in some places, up to 300 millimetres of precipitation could rain in a few hours, in some cases nearly 500 millimetres, which together with rising sea levels could flood a number of settlements on the coast.
Zeman lends general rank to Colonel Lipko
President Miloš Zeman will lend general rank to Colonel Pavel Lipk on Wednesday.
It's coming from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for lending the rank of Brigadier General is the August launch of Lipka to the post of deputy commander of the Allied Multinational Division of the Northeast in Poland.
Lipka has been acting as a deputy commander of the Czech army's ground forces.
Zeman's promotion was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Brigadier General Karl Řehek will replace Brigadier General Karl Řehek as Deputy Commander of the Multinational Northeast Division in Elblag, Poland, which commands the Allied Forces to present in Poland and the Baltic.
In March, Říhka became Director of the National Cybernetic and Information Security Office (NÚKIB).
The government has suggested to the President that Lipek lend the rank of Brigadier General.
Under the Occupational Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be granted to a soldier for the duration of his or her term of office or for the duration of his or her duties requiring a higher rank.
The post of Deputy Head of the Alliance Division shall correspond to the General's rank.
A soldier to whom a rank has been granted shall have the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he shall not be entitled to an adjustment to the salary corresponding to that rank.
The lending of the rank shall continue until such time as it has been granted for a reason.
" Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional preparedness and is a model for subordinates.
In a significant way, he is involved in carrying out the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and securing the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence stated in June on a proposal for promotion.
The Wednesday promotion will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, attended by the Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help reduce the spread of the new Coronavirus.
German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer announced it.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the distance or wear of the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats on the aircraft will not have to remain vacant.
Reuters reported it.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," said Scheuer at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it had yet to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures shall include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers from six years old, to comply with the recommended distance at security controls and to check-in at the airport.
There must be sufficient fresh air in the aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airline will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
The differences in standards caused confusion.
The Arctic Spicbers had a temperature record, measured almost 22 degrees.
"A 41-year-old record fell in Longyearbyen," said the Norwegian meteorological institute on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Fahrenheit, exceeding the 1979 record.
About 200,000 Longyearbyen is the largest city on the Špicberky, located about 1300 kilometres from the North Pole.
The pins are heating faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia - reported last year in the report of the Norwegian Center for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature in Špicberk increased by three to five degrees from the 1970s.
By 2100, it can rise by up to ten degrees, unless greenhouse gas discharges into the atmosphere are reduced.
Temperature growth can result in the Spicberks in the form of permanent frozen soil melting, jeopardising the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
A mandatory two-week quarantine awaits the British return from Spain
The British cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all roads to mainland Spain that are not necessary because of the risk of covid-19 disease spreading.
The Canary and Balearic islands are not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people must be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force at midnight.
"Protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," she said in her statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe ones," she added.
As the British Metro newspaper noted, the latest announcement will impact the travel plans of thousands of British people.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British are concerned, among other things, whether they will be paid sick if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from the holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a 10-day vacation at Lanzarote, leaving on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go to the whole family, my wife Amanda and Bethany's daughter, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as an engineer, and I don't think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks on my return from vacation," said Metro Hunter.
With regard to Spain, there is concern that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of epidemic.
Over the last two days, over 900 newly infected people have always arrived in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening up coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia, to limit all nightlife and to prevent people from meeting in the big.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently pointed out an increased risk of disease in Catalonia, Aragonia, Basque and Madrid.
The model of electricity purchase from Dukovan will be discussed by the government
The government will discuss on Monday the model of electricity purchase from the planned new block of Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill assumes that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, all consumers will pay the difference through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the price on the market, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final electricity price for customers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for YES) and the energy company ČEZ have already stated that the more likely option is that people will save electricity thanks to the construction.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook on electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as has been demonstrated several times in the past.
The intention has already been criticised by environmental organisations.
"The purchase price can be both below the market price of power electricity and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact is broken down between customers according to the size of the fuse - at lower consumption or according to the consumption of electricity - at higher electricity consumption," said the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) in the material.
Havlíček said in May that he assumed that the wholesale price of electricity would grow and that people on the building of Dukovan would make a living.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns per year will be much less per family than people pay annually in electricity invoices to support so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatthour (MWh).
The material submitted shall not contain any draft amount, to be included in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, on which traders are now the most stocked, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) for MWh.
"In contrast to the purchase price and the market price of power electricity of 10 euros, an average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year could be charged to four-member households, which are normally equipped with electric appliances, including electric hobs and ovens, which do not use electricity for heating and heating of hot water - less than 100 CZK per year," wrote the MIT government.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The Coronavir pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be an expressively speculative issue," said the former CEO of the Energy Financial Group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law foresees that the purchase would be carried out by the MIT, or by a legally responsible person owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the State guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, including a repeated one, but not later than the end of the operation of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines as a power plant with nuclear reactor connected to an electricity system with installed capacity with a minimum electricity output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously said that the new dubovan block should have an output of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to the 10th expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The financing model of the new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The State should finance the facility in a cost-effective manner, with a 2% interest calculated in operation.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model, it also regrets the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should share 70 percent of the construction.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
The CEO of ČEZ Daniel Beneš said in May that the expected sum for building the block at current prices is approximately EUR 6 billion (approximately CZK 162 billion).
Contracts between the State and ČEZ on the construction of a new dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
Ministry of Local Development downloaded material on supporting tourism in the media for two billion
According to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns on holiday advertising in the Czech Republic in the media, on the internet and on billboards, the Office withdrawn from the commentary procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for YES) server ListaNews.cz said that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was pointed out on Friday by the server Zprava.cz.
The Ministry's plan justifies the fall in tourism because of the coronavirus.
During the Coronavirus crisis, the media and income drop were reported.
The proposal called for criticism of the opposition as well as representatives of tourism.
According to the proposal, which is now available on hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money to television, radio, press, internet, billboards or areas on railway stations via the State Tourism Support Agency CzechTourism.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given television.
Most of them would get Nova and Prima's private television.
Printed journals and weekly journals would receive 400 million and the same part would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would be private stations again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas on railway stations or in metro.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic should start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," said Dostálová without further details of the ListNews server.
The material criticized the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarová Adamová, media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) would benefit from advertising.
"I firmly believe that this spectacular contempt will get between the eyes in the autumn at the election," she wrote on twitter.
She rejects the fact that it is in fact about helping the media hit by the crisis.
"It may even be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she said on Friday.
According to her, the budget is two billion indicative.
"We're counting it, of course, it can be less or more.
It's working material," she said.
Initiativeally, saving tourism makes no sense to the media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in tourism, not a unnecessary advertising campaign," said the chairman of the initiative Tomáš Barčík.
If those two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should direct companies, not the media, write an initiative in an open letter to the government.
The broth of life, the cock of beer and death like the blade of grass
After death is the third album called And death is the blade of grass of Brno poet, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, May 24.
In Frič's discography it is the fifth item and, like in previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Frič's poetry, which is itself an excellent artist.
Frič, 1949, was, of course, influenced by the American beat generation, but this was inspired by his own personal experience and also by the very inner manifestations of faith.
However, he was far removed from the pursuits of an agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, unaggressive, completely tolerant.
I can think of in this connection Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček), the masters will apologize.
Frič's album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who always very sensitively accompanied him, whether he was a cellist Josef Klucze, or Honza Bartoň and Věztěslav Holata.
I would like to help myself - in the words of Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poems.
"They gave them proud and endless bitterness," Pruška writes, "over the condition of our world threatened by extinction.
The world, which is increasingly falling into obscurity of consumption vanity and fury, is increasingly moving away from what its soul was created from the mysteries of faith, humility and human proximity.
There was a lot of interest in those who knew that the values for which he was created were few, but who also knew that only because of general disinterest they could not be disowned.
Those poems reminded us that a person may have to lose everything expensive, but it is irrelevant how he will lose it.
If he sells himself to general bankruptcy, skeptically resists, silently shuts down, or stays in a calm and proud state of mind about what he believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamáček
The former prime minister and president of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid social democracy advisor.
The President of the Party and the Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hammock said it on Prima Partie's TV show today.
On Friday, Paroubek informed the server ListaNews.cz.
"We write a text from time to time, he sends me some material sometimes, and I read it," said Hamáček today.
He added, however, that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the ČSSD does not have the resources to waste them for similar purposes.
"Sometimes I read his opinion, there's a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS Member Jana Černoch, the Minister said that many ODS members are still "uncoveredly listening to the views of Václav Klaus".
He thinks it's okay because it's an experienced politician and a former party president, which is the Paroubek case.
The fact that the media are making this an affair has marked this season as a sign of cucumber.
Server ListNews.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of Hamáčkov's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth position of the candidate party in the mouth region was directed by former president of the local cell Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and acted as vice-chairman of his party LEV 21.
Hamáček said today that the candidate's composition will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, he's a kick in the ass, lamenting Sweden's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American barber who has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis by two years younger, and last year he beat him to the meeting of the NCAA University Association.
"We had a battle a year ago, then he won and I was the second, then we switched.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," Nilsen describes, which won by the performance of 5.95 meters.
But since then, Duplantis has fired a steep shot up and is now alone in the highest pole spheres.
In just 20 years he became a world record player, this February 8th in Toruni overcame a bar of 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow he added a centimetre.
"He jumped six meters in his 18th year of high school," remembers his Nilsen peer for World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he had grown up from a boy in a man, all his potential and talents would be tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record," he says.
Even though Nilsen's record of success is thinner than the one Duplantis is proud of, he has similar goals.
In February this year, he improved his inner personal record to 5.93 m. Last August, he won a gold medal at the Panama Games in Lima, and in 2017 he made his way to the US World Championship, where he finished 13.
The closest milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"Definitely, it is my priority to get on a professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name for yourself," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events such as the Olympic Games, the World Cup or the Panameric Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are being postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other stickers time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere battle for silver?
"Everybody's trying to catch him, but I don't think it's gonna be possible anytime soon," Nilsen thinks.
"This boy's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile ahead of everyone else in practice."
And by the time Tokyo 2021 starts, he's gonna want to raise it up.
The woman has spent hundreds of thousands of years on a disability pension that can't be her son.
She's going to have a trial.
The money received by a 33 - year - old man as a disability pension is intended primarily to improve the quality of his life.
For embezzlement, a woman may be in prison for up to eight years.
Because of ill health, the trial of a sick man of lawlessness was removed, and his mother was appointed as a guardian, who was to manage, among other things, his son’s money.
"The woman, from mid-November 2013 to this January, used part of her son's disability pension funds for her needs, and she took it for 440 thousand crowns," said police spokesperson Dana Ladman, saying that the accused woman was a liability to defend the victim's interests as a guardian.
A woman, according to the court order, set up an account for her son, but his pension was sent to her account.
"After paying the costs of staying in a health facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and running a household," she is charged.
That he couldn't use his son's money for his own sake, the woman admitted it.
However, she argued that she had helped her parents pay for their family expenses.
"We had problems with our income to keep the household going.
We've never bought anything superior.
It was always for things the son would approve of buying.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, claims scientists after finding instruments
Findings from the cave of Chiquihuite in Zacatecas, Mexico, include 1930 instruments from limestone, including a fine blade that could have been used to cut meat, and pointy objects that could have served as piles of spears or spears.
Scientists found that the oldest of the instruments came from between 33,000 and 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said the archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the lead author of one of the two studies that were published on this topic in the magazine Nature.
The youngest tools are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the people of the cave Chiquihuite, located at a high altitude, lived for 20,000 years.
So far the widely recognized theory spoke about the fact that the first representatives of Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from the area of Russia today to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archeological evidence, including the unique tip of spears used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this clover culture has subsequently spread to a large part of North America.
But in recent decades, this model has been discovered by several ancient settlements between two and three thousand years older.
In a second study published in the magazine Nature, 42 different locations throughout North America prove human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to North America's mainland before they were supposed to.
Some of them could have made it to America by boat.
"It is clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovian culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn from the University of Alberta, Canada.
So far, the interest in tickets is met by an optimistic scenario, claims the sellers.
Prices are gradually reduced
Flight sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Although the interest is still about half of last summer, demand increases by up to 20 percent every week.
The development after the crisis thus fills the most optimistic scenarios according to the sellers.
Flights prices are gradually reduced.
The most sought-after destinations are mainly South European countries, according to retailers.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are leading.
At Lotuška.cz portal, flights to Split, Croatia, are the most sold.
Other countries are then the UK's most sought-after, but it was one of the most difficult destinations ever.
The average flight price is also reduced.
At Lotuška.cz, around 6250 crowns moved around mid-month, 3000 crowns less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to the increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices are falling to some European places, such as Spain or Italy, by about a fifth in the last few weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets with a much lower advance than before because they are concerned about the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to previous information Kiwi.com, the flight purchase time before the flight decreased by approximately 10 days a year.
"This confirms the future trend, when people will order tickets with much less time ahead, they will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Michal Šindelář, vice president for Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
The number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing with the growth of sales.
There are currently more than 60 regular routes at Prague airport.
It's about half of the destinations against last summer's season.
The big finale tonight!
Follow the arrowr battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC has reached the big finale.
It will introduce an experienced 49-year-old Scottish darter Gary Anderson and a surprise tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson took out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in a spreadsheet.
However, James Wade was also able to deal with him, and in the quarterfinals he fought with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home a world-class one.
"Flying Scots" was almost in the semifinals when he faced Michael Smith.
But at the last moment he escaped the tomb from the shovel, in extension he dominated and after the result 18:16 he won the place in the finale of the tournament, which he mastered already in 2018 when in an amazing battle he defeated Mensur Suljovich 21:19.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
Belgian talent enjoys the tournament and just maybe knowing that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on a absolutely fantastic wave.
The 16-year-old arrowper first surprisingly eliminated the world's six-year-old Nathan Aspinall, and in a dramatic battle they pushed Jo Cullen, and in the quarter-finals he also conquered Adrian Lewis.
The big check was semifinal.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the introductory, but in the calm playing Belgian then gained an excellent series lead, which he then held more or less easily to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, putting the occasional uncertainty on the doubles.
Coronavir cases have come at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus in the Czech Republic was first discovered, 15 212 people have been infected with it.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 have died.
At present, 5 254 people are sick.
It's based on the data on the health department's website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times two hundred each.
Maxim was 281 cases Friday.
On Thursday, 235 were tested positive, 246 earlier and 206 on Tuesday.
The first working day of this week was 169 infected.
From Covid-19, 9 590 people have been cured in the Czech Republic, i.e. 63 percent of all infected people.
Most of the time, the disease had a mild course.
According to recent reports from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with Coronavir, the condition of 19 of whom is considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
The most infected people in the last seven days still show Karvinia, almost 59.
Followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infected to 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people in the Czech Republic, new measures against the spread of coronavir have been in place since Saturday.
People must wear dresses at internal mass events over 100 people, such as cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these actions will be reduced from the present thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have proven to be infected with the new coronavir has already crossed the 16 million line.
It was reported by Johns Hopkins University of America, which is following the development of a pandemic globally.
According to this source, the balance of victims who died with Covid-19 disease is close to 645,000.
The latest million infected came to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million border fell on 22 July.
In recent days, the United States has already registered over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where almost 1.4 million people have been infected by the authorities.
The infected are now increasing at a record rate.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases have arrived worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily balance since the start of the pandemic.
These developments can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in the populous states, such as the US, Brazil or India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases has grown in nearly 40 countries around the world in the past week.

Household air is up to five times worse than outdoors.
Health harms air fresheners and deodorant
Health threatens not only poor air quality in outdoor spaces but also at home.
The Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted the journal The Jerusalem Post, drew attention to this.
According to Abraham, who deserved the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, household pollution needs to be addressed right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the American Environment Agency (EPA), according to which domestic air quality is five times worse than outdoor air quality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die early every year because of poor air quality in their homes.
"It is because of the Coronavir epidemic, which has forced many to work from home, people must spend more hours in homes than before, so it is time to focus on household air quality," said Abraham.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one deals with the quality of the "home air".
The danger may be things with which a person normally comes into contact - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poison gas also gives out clothes that we regularly wear to the dry cleaners," Abraham said.
According to her, the most threatened are children, old household members, and people with breathing problems.
Otherwise, healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, irritability of the nasal passages, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
In long-term exposure to unhealthy substances, the internal organs and the central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all the pollutants come from indoor objects, the source may be the material from which the houses are built.

After all, 10 years later, Gott invited an ex-president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
