Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, total 29 percent
According to the first preliminary results, the strong coalition and the strong strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have brought about the Sunday early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly strong losses, where the position of President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaking.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Korean commander Jörg Haider is preparing a triumphant return to national policy.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the votes remains, but against the last 2006 elections, it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
The ÖVP was even worse off, which is losing almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both these great parties in Austrian post-war history and, in particular, of the populace-creating, literally catastrophic outcome.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP stepped out of the coalition, the people had a significant lead in the preference to SPÖ.
The voters, however, apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about the possible resignation of the President of the Party and the Vice-Chairman Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers consider that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Bureau of the Party.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path towards an increasingly likely exit from the electoral outcome, i.e. the renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - free (FPÖ) they obtained a preliminary 18 percent and an 11 percent of the votes - but at the same time social democrats expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999, when the populists agreed with the populists (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it cut off from the BZÖ) on a common government that even raised sanctions by the European Union.
Haider seems to be betting on this development, which has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna's national policy.
The Green Party came to Parliament, but it was easily lost and fell between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties clearly exceeded the four-percent limit and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations can cool down
If the problem with Czech scientists who were accused of collecting bugs in India could not be solved, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister said it in New York after a meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranáb Mukherji today.
"If this had not been resolved, then yes, there would have been a cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on the Czech initiative.
After the hearing, Mukherji said that executive power could hardly interfere with judicial matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švách, who was acquitted and fined, the central government may deal with the local government in Dardžiling, in whose jurisdiction the case falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji thought it best to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the sentence to be released, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also expressed his views during the meeting.
"He recommends appeals to the higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can enter the whole matter is to provide the condemned 'competent legal support', said the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that such help was already provided by the Indian party.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining with India the best relationships that have a long tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge it," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as the CTK said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a deep error of incarceration and indictment of these Czech scientists," he said.
Answers to the question of whether he was given a promise from the Indian party to deal with things have been avoided by the Minister.
"I've had quite a few promises," he said only.
The Czech Republic judges the fight for the seabed
It shall proceed to a wall electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he does not care about the continent, but about the small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and the adjacent seabed along with it.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuoso, who belongs to the 30-member team of UN Division on Ocean Affairs and Maritime Law.
His boss, director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, watches and sometimes complements the interpretation.
It's the work elation and enthusiasm that rule.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Here you can find oil, ore and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a cure for cancer.
A bottom larger than a mainland
Today, coastal states have begun to apply for new marine territories vehemently.
According to the UN Convention, they exercise their rights as agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, she has exclusive entitlement to all sources of continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly speaking, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is the natural continuation of the continent beneath the sea, is beyond the continental shelf.
It extends beyond the coastline, often beyond the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-effective surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three countries have succeeded so far," says Mikulka.
The world’s voice has recently seen the success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its underwater possessions.
However, he also gained New Zealand - the seabed that the commission granted him last week - is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profit that will flow from their use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, be priceless.
It shall submit its applications gradually to the other States.
They can do so until ten years after they ratified the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins with a convention declared "a common heritage of mankind".
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this field is granted by the Convention established by an international institution.
"The seabed, however, is no Klondajk," says Director Mikulka in exaggeration, saying that "the individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime contracted".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the common organisation "Interaceanmetal".
In 1991, according to the Convention, as well as investors of a few other states, it acquired the status of a so-called "prevention investor".
He has the authority to benefit from the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The investor of the explored area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is fragmented, it's a kind of underwater replica of Tater.
"It can be mined on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic conglomerations containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another Ind Pakshi Rajan lawyer.
The Macedonian worker of the Rober Sandev division brings one such concretion to the show.
It reminds me of a small potato or, in a little fantasy, a fairy tale that according to legend brought the Golem back to life.
The German special deployment units were in the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in the resolution of the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, special forces were prepared, however, there was no deployment.
The public is gradually receiving further details of the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior, German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
According to the Ministry's statements, both the experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorism group of the German police force GSG9, the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as experts in logistics from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk).
However, according to a further announcement from the spokesmen of the two ministries on Monday afternoon, there was no need for German forces because the kidnappers had let their captives go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government, said to have accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for the on-site action.
"It didn't happen, fortunately," said one of the spokesmen of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight of their Egyptian guides in the south of Egypt on September 19th.
After their abduction in the desert region in the south of Egypt, they moved hostages to border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment as well as details of the exemption or possible payment of the ransom.
They're already saved in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of the hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin no information is available yet when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the letter "Bild" all five tourists should leave with special forces one of the Airbuses of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress had a $700 billion bailout dropped by a close majority.
The Dow Jones index has fallen heavily.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives rejected the government rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both sides, the majority has not been found for a programme that should ease the chaos of the financial markets.
Dramatic actions were desperately trying to convince the critics of a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called on a Member to express his consent, although, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It is difficult to obtain political recognition for avoiding something that has not happened at all," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the investor's concern that the state rescue package might fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index value was raised so that it would fall again steeply after the announcement of the crash of the package.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
For the programme to enter into force, the approval of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel agents record increasing numbers of reservations
Looks like winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in tourism:
According to one study, travel reservations for the next months increased significantly compared to the previous year - to the winter season by even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic growth, the desire of the Germans to travel unblemished.
For the winter season reservation, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Union (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey of the GfK market research institute, increased booking rates are available for autumn months.
In October 2007 the turnover was around eleven percent higher, according to the DRV’s observations.
These results are based on GfK numbers, which evaluates data on reservations from 1200 German travel agencies each month and interpolates them on the overall market.
This result included booking of tours that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the US is primarily requested, said DRV.
For these trips, the increase in reservations is about one third.
In addition, the Germans are especially desirable targets of Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic water.
First of all, organized tours are on course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
With regard to rising energy and food expenditure, there is a cost "for the client easier to count than for the individually organised holiday".
Laepple explained that money could save consumers, inter alia, by using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so when compared to the previous year, a higher turnover will again be recorded - although according to another study, the number of Germans taking a trip has fallen compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
An endlessly repeated pop, a beer made of butts and prominents from well-known designers.
First time in a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, TV hostess and wears a custom-made cut.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we are not even three minutes away from the beer meadow, and already photographers are throwing themselves at us and hbitfully filling the memory cards - I am flattered, for I am at Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you make friends.
It seems my cheap suit has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, and so my sense of comfort in costume was rather limited.
But right on arrival at Theresienwies, everything's better than it seemed.
Almost everyone's wearing women's costumes or leather pants; nobody's looking disgusted or embarrassingly hurt - everything's completely normal.
Strange looks at the banana stand in chocolate only harvest my apron.
One monk warns me that I mistook her: "On the left, you're free, in the middle of a virgin, on the right, widowed in the back."
I'm going to sneak the bow from the back to the left.
"All right," he says, "and he laughs.
Others do not deal so much with subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats with the inscription "It wire to get dressed!" and shove on the passing naked buttocks.
A young man with such flashing tendencies is called Bob, is from England and came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He looks "gorgous," with an extended "oh."
That's what he's telling me after he's relieved of his drunk husband.
Right next to one of those hydrants everyone thinks they're trash cans.
So Bob is one of the feared "Wildbieslers" in Bavaria, as they say in public to freely urinate people.
The rest of them don't have the luck of getting rid of alcohol like that.
Around eight o'clock, they're running around the area where Oktoberfest is held, with a lot of health care professionals who have to take care of poor drunkards.
Medical professionals always appear in flocks - in four they wear a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
They work like most beer meadow visitors: empty there, full back again.
Anyone who lies under the sail of this coffin of mercy can't be seen.
"They're the ones that can't go any further," one of the paramedics will call me in answer to my question and disappear in the crowd.
Police released the name of the accident victim
The name of a 33 - year - old woman who died in a hospital after she was hit by a car in Essex.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson from the Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, an 11-year-old male was arrested for suspicion of reckless driving.
He's been released on police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began to seek entry into the European Union, European powers wanted to penetrate deep into the Turkish clash.
On the eastern bank of Bospor, perhaps only 20 steps in Asia, one of the best sights of this failed imperial ambition is standing.
Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in a neo-renaissance style.
That's what the tourist guides will tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platforms with a tower on every corner of the front, looking at the indiscretion from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The entire structure is slowly falling apart.
But once you get inside the vault, you can no longer doubt the size of a business whose western gate the station was.
The station opened in August 1908 the German consortium of Anatolian-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which was involved in the game of the empires, intended to implement its ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad, and further into the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their colleges were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial forces proceeded from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And bad news came for Hydarpasha Station, too.
In 1917, he destroyed the munitions train's elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually dredging, and history has been around it.
However, today this gate to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - ACP - have created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I took a night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was to meet with one of the leading ACP experts on foreign policy, the Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a scorching ride on the tracks, which reminded the ancient rhythms of the famous documentary Night Post, I arrived at the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new town for the secular state, which wants to turn back on its otmanian past.
However, the ACP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
In the west, she raised suspicions, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the main ACP tent, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on developing suburbs, surrounded by half-built shopping houses and power stores, where middle managers in business suits - men and women - meet to make early morning shops.
Suat Kiniclioglu could be a central-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Saka, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
"The aim of the Party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its shoulder.
Today, they must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It must have done both.
"But I'm sure there will be a moment," I asked, "when might Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "didn't wish such a decision had to take place."
After that, he stressed what almost everyone I spoke to said almost from memory: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region are just as good for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, follow these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another most of the night's sleep, I thought of the two German men Herr Ritter and Herr Con who watched this building build 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, of course, in Turkish hands.
And when I waited in the harbor for the ferry back through Bospor, I remembered that those days, Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least at the time there were not many doubts that the continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Commemorative Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Nekrolog, 11.September) was in charge of Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district's music plan, he founded a year for this excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be up to 21 years old, but at the time Proteus sang his last song in 1979, there were a few of us almost 30 - we just refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape converter) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to go into any music that was presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either separately or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often stunning, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of the only man and enthusiasm for music, which remained completely unchanged all the time.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself"?
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His tactics technique was perfectly clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor motivating.
Wherever the music standard was, he always picked it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If there was supposed to be a conductor matching the knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the two decades when he conducted Guildford Philharamint from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "touched one or two soaked furnaces around the world."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25, 1946) says that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying at BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's author's note at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time completed his dissertation on the British Guáren industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it as a British Guáren industry publication in 1958.
He actually spent 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and summer 1952 at the Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and moved on to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend José Vicente Resina's "Flamenco and Life" exhibition because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was enticed by the simplicity and the strong charge with which the viewers are involved, and by the respect and consideration of the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of affection.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda will attack her bestseller for the second time.
In November, Honda will launch the second generation sales of Jazz.
If the predecessor of this one-space vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers even more spacious interiors.
This includes improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow for more fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the lines of the new Jazz are very similar from an aesthetic point of view, there have been many changes in this one-space vehicle.
For example, innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines should be mentioned.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we will notice is that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other producers.
Although Jazz is a less-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is a case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
In Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold since Honda Jazz was released.
The second market became an old continent with approximately half a million pieces sold in six years.
However, Honda aims to increase its sales in its category.
That is, while this Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Honda Jazz in 2007, estimates are made by 100,000 cars in 2009, which would increase by 17% in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects the sale of 2,000 units per year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Hona to significantly mitigate the decrease in sales in Spain.
In fact, the management of the car company expects the year to end with a total of 22,000 pieces sold, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share to 1,8 %, compared to 1,6 % last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda is relying on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid of a size of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
As far as markets are concerned, according to the Japanese producer, 50 % of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages are divided by the old continent and Japan.
The launch of the Honda Insight sale is expected in the first months of next year as soon as it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions have increased with the new Jazz.
Its length increased up to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and axlebase to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
By increasing dimensions, the interior space was enlarged as well.
This advantage was achieved by using a new platform, as well as by storing a fuel tank in the middle of a car that was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
The volume of luggage space - which has a double bottom system - has also increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of luggage space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are found with the 1.4 engine, as the volume of luggage space for Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement in addition to the external elements - such as the back LED lights or the possibility of equipping with a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an 80 degree angle to be opened compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
For the second generation of Honda Jazz, there are new engines.
At first, this small model will be offered with two gasoline engines of 1,2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that enables lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvement of the propulsion system at the same time as high torque to the full range of engine speeds.
The first 1.2 litre engine has 90 horsepower at 6,000 speeds with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 speeds.
This engine - which had a previous generation Jazz 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and an emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horses in the previous generation, the current engine will reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and an emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Car Bee" prevents collisions
This time Nissan was inspired by the development of accident-protection technologies in nature, specifically in bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the pattern of flying bees to prevent collisions.
Such is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in the prevention of precipitation technologies.
Engineers of the Centre for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robot developed in cooperation with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, Director-General of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Brand Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four areas of the safety shield of Nissan.
The robot has the task of strengthening the ability to prevent precipitation in vehicles of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the safety shield of Nissan.
But the most important are the folded bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions an angle greater than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
When the engineers created this visual function, they suggested what they called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles that are up to a distance of two meters in a 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends the signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a warning against the collision.
"When the obstacle is recorded, the robot mimics the bee movements and immediately changes the direction by turning the wheels to the right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If that were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobile Laboratory and the main engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards and diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction by which it is possible to rotate its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities like bees.
In addition to the acceleration and slowdown, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent a collision.
"The equipment only needs to process the information every few seconds and to be maintained according to this data.
It does not require storage of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we don't talk about a gig or a mega."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of precipitation, a technology where Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the goal and avoid obstacles on the road.
Enjoy your fear before you take a mortgage
It should be recognised that the U.S. Treasury, in addition to having sufficient capital to distribute the injections, has no lack of ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages at banks with a questionable solvency, it has created a popular-scientific game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
Or the "Hotel of Bad Credits"... or the wrong hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionists look gloomy to change one, two or three times whether it's the right time to ask for credit.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, even if not too detailed.
It's a site more suitable for young people than for the public.
And what happens when the game is over?
There will be a dream room inside the hotel.
At least something, because I don't want to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens up its MUFG capital
Morgan Stanley’s bank house reported that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest bank in Japan that would spend nine billion dollars to get 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report was accompanied by a significant fall in its exchange rate.
A week after they revealed their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's current shares at a uniform price of $25.25, representing a total value of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the book value of securities at 31 August.
The MUFG Bank invests another six billion dollars in the acquisition of conversionable securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average unit price of $29, i.e. 28% below his current rate.
Morgan Stanley's shares still lost 6.79% and reached 23.07 dollars around 17.00 Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to speed up the transition of Morgan Stanley to banking holding," explained John Mack, general manager of this American group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which would allow him to diversify his activities, but at the same time, it placed him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest aces in Wall Street to take a much more prudent approach than before.
The terms presented on Monday show, among other things, that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for approximately $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought," explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, "that our participation will consist solely of ordinary shares.
However, given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7 % less for Morgan Stanley's securities than their book value.
And the operation will result in a 20% reduction in the share profit.
The agreement assumes that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter are exchanged for a certain period at a price of 50 % exceeding the exchange price, i.e. around 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow him to take advantage of the investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the spokesperson of the group refused to provide further details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast about 15 %, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that since the end of August he "sensibly" reduced his balance.
The last few weeks have been difficult for the group, since its exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of default associated with the debt have increased sharply.
These costs took the opposite trend on Monday, but remained high, around 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" of the big Wall Street investment banks, announced after the failure of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's ransom, claimed $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quit.
Refounding a republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorn Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third party submitted a proposal for a new Constitution for a vote, modelled by his counterparts and friends.
And his mission is fulfilled, because 64% of the voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the referendum "yes".
"No" according to these results was 28 %, 7 % of the votes were invalid and 0,7 % of the voting tickets were empty.
In order to accept the Constitution's proposal, he had to win half the votes plus one.
Two surveys carried out at the east of the electoral rooms and the calculation of a non-governmental organization predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, with them situated between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa, after all, demanded the victory of his draft Constitution at night from Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won the whole line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil governorship headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quita.
They understand themselves that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from her Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the OEA observation mission, took place in peace, concerned a text on 444 points building up the "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The proposal of the Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over the economy by reserving it with the "planning of development" of a country that lives mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from the foreign currencies sent by its emigrants.
The proposal adopted by Correa, elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of State, which will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that it will use this competence and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution strengthens the principle of free health and education, which the President began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, the ban on the presence of foreign troops is also envisaged, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuador base as the starting point for US drug operations.
19 hostages were liberated in Chad
The Egyptian commander took 11 tourists and their eight - member companions into custody ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were brought to Egypt’s capital on Monday.
During the morning, the Egyptian commando liberated them in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, close to the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transferred without having the opportunity to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, a peripheral residential district of Cairo, to undergo medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers", said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoher Garrana at the airport.
Since its capture on September 19th during the safari in a vehicle with four-wheel drive at the foot of Mount Uanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five German and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border manager of Aegyptus, an organizer of safari.
A representative of the Egyptian security forces suggested that 30 members of the special forces, who approached the site on board two helicopters, set off on the trail during the night just before dawn.
"There was a gunfight, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said this source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the unit of "blossom" were sent to Sudan, where they received support from the German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is currently located, mentioned the role played by secret agents and components of Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of the people of our secret services, with special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that a ransom would be paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese army declared that during the patrol, the four-wheel drive had been detained, with the kidnappers on board, six of which were killed, including the Chad commander, and two were arrested.
The army claimed to have been linked to the rebel group in Darfur, the Liberation Movement of Sudan - Unit (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - Quiet majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate about the financing of culture is filled with headlines by newspapers and is the topic of the ongoing election campaign.
The better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will arise to wash the poor sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national memorial sites that starve?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that they are neglecting their monuments and their historical buildings?
That in Quebec, like Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore a mere chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organisations, in cooperation.
In Québek, a federation of companies for the history of Québek, at least 40,000 volunteers are seeking to be associated with 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy to spread history, preserve a pile of private archives and protect the archaeological remains for a few change.
Often these societies are watchdogs of our monuments, which are driven by hopelessness protesting when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers to old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When do we finally get to the grandstand for history and monuments?
Benelux government national bank of Fortis
The states of Benelux will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, the first to get into trouble in Europe due to the growing impact of the crisis in the US mortgage market, with a partial nationalisation: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institute, which also has capital participation in Hungary, by EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend was agreed at the highest level by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch Governments with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to be seen as precedents in the context of the crisis of international financial markets, which has spread over more than a year.
In the sense of the decision that was born on Sunday night, all three countries will redeem nearly half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets there.
The bank will sell with absolute certainty part of its capital shares, especially – mainly insurance – activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis bank shares began to drop rapidly last week, and in the second half of the week serious signs of crisis were already in the institute.
However, analysts agree that with their 85 000 employees, the bank is too big to let it go.
The company's securities fell only 12 percent on Friday, to a minimum of 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the total market value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the business leaders, this is unrealistic.
In fact, the company’s management blames for the fall of Fortis’ shares the uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday, the stock already increased slightly.
A new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to the bank's head on Friday.
The money institute was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer no one has applied yet.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
The bank's clients have not yet had a panic, and the branches have not been taken up by the attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also bought several leasing companies.
The fox in the hen house
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with the applicant on the basis of data on drug purchases.
Data protection experts are concerned that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of data on prescription of medicines in any case, subject to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the chicken fox," quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of a program designed to monitor prescriptions.
The insurance company shall make the insurance and the amounts paid in the event of insurance events dependent on the health of the persons concerned and, if the risk is assessed too large, shall not close the insurance with it.
They used to send the concerned to medical examination and the contract was concluded only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the pharmacies identification number, the customer can easily find out what drugs he bought in the last year and a half, from which the program is self-inflicted, what disease he's suffering from and what his condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large number of cholesterol-lowering medicines, this refers to the fact that he has virtually uncontrollably high levels of blood fats, which immediately puts him in a higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation, some of them also determine the risk factor, so that there is hardly any work left to the insurance company in addition to the paperwork, although small difficulties arise.
The disadvantages are that many medicines can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds are used against migraines or hot flushes, but are also effective against depression.
These represent, from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, a significant risk-increasing factor, while not the first-named difficulties.
In order to request and process the data, special companies were created which, before they could obtain the necessary information from the pharmacies, would ask the patient for permission.
They are already forcing the authorities to do so, even though they have not punished them for their negligence so far.
Some companies have already processed the results of laboratory tests that combine data on the medicines used, so that they can provide an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health condition.
More and more companies have access to the data, while checking their use will become more and more complex.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which will give the authorities the power to control also companies specialising in the provision of data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: that is why he has developed his programme so that the transfer of data is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the permission in question can hardly be denied, or the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with it.
So the hens are a little bit dependent on the fox's goodwill.
Global Marseilles menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are two leading trading partners, this topic has led, in addition to other major global problems, to the agenda of the ninth highest-level meeting.
There will also be a French-Indian summit today, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union acknowledges that India is a developing democratic power that should be given greater opportunity to speak on international issues, but the Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator on the issue of promoting the permanent membership of New Delhi in the United Nations Security Council.
This question was not even discussed at the Ninth Summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solan, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed to double trade turnover in five years, or to increase to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, it is not an excessively ambitious objective.
In this sign, from a legal point of view, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were brought together, so that air transport also got the green light into the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is in the EU's ninth place.
The Summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, respectively, has been condemned by both parties in all its forms and called for a rapid convening of the UN conference.
They also called for the conclusion of the Doha trade negotiations, although both have a large share of its failure to date.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed, as well as the need for a global agreement and a 50 % reduction of greenhouse gas production by 2050 at the climate conference next year.
Both parties would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and encourage the convening of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is now travelling to the French capital, where he is about to close a trade in the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that the mandate to build Indian nuclear reactors worth EUR 20 billion will be won by French companies.
According to agency reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Great participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishers will participate in the 60th edition of Buchmess, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair expects over seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171.790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to be seen, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
The Deputy Minister of Culture, Francesco Maria Giro, will represent the Italian Government at the inaugural ceremony in the Italian pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) at 264 square meters of exhibition space.
There will be a meeting with the press in the Buchmessa Structure Room in Hall 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of the publishing house in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books of foreign authors is still decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, especially in view of the literature for children and adults.
Found plane by Steve Fossetta, millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was found, a millionaire who disappeared September 3, 2007, while crossing the desert in Nevada.
The ruins were discovered on one of the high seas at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the area of Mammoth Lakes in Sieřr Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
Sheriff Madeira County, John Anderson, spread out the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are confident that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day that he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff thus specified that neither human remains were found in the plane nor in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Agency for Transport Safety (Ntsb) announced that a few hours after the diagnosis of the debris was sent a task force that finally identified the plane: it is exactly Bellancu 8kcab, missing from September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal items were found with one pair near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Air Force Administration, cash and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has won a place in history thanks to a long collection of primes.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of flying alone.
Three years later, he traveled around the world on a plane without landing.
Many of his records include years at a height of 15,445 meters, above the Andes, even with a copilot.
Glk, a commercial you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk of the "compassionate" jeeps of the star's house, using which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a vortex of news into this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional processing that the unexpected and unconventional communication will be accompanied by the launch of Suv Glk and will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will also launch an unofficial mode of communication thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for the automotive brand.
The project of maxi posters, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan business class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of a car in stereoscopic vision and with special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, you will see a new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, if you look at the picture, you will feel that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elmina8 technology, the new Glk will be enlightened at different moments in all its small things, so that it will be reassembled in a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical area of car communication with this ad.
Is he going to be able to raise the interest of future customers in this way? We will see.
Now we know who the Italian hooligans are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been watching Nazionale azzurra for years and which has never, in fact, made excessive problems.
She never even met her opponent fans.
Group orientation is right.
The founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Terst e Udine.
In Sofia they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colored flags on which the cities of origin appear: they were removed on Saturday night so that they would not be recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
They found true Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levsky.
Figc made available to Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all in name, i.e. easy to control.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasle, no one who would be forbidden to attend the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had earlier offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and no match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the riot.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, don't even walk into one stadium anymore.
For luck.
But now there is a fear of simulation: that means that more than one hundred and fifty will be added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who behave in this way", they confirm from Viminal.
So, "well-opened eyes, especially because of the national game in Leča."
In Puglia, there is a small core of supporters.
Osservatorio will meet tomorrow, on Tuesday Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, it is a secret service that deals with problems in stadiums.
"The Congregation Leaders of the Fuhrer and a tight arm during Mameli's Anthem?
This is the idea of Domenic Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way) which is the director of Viminálské Osservatoria (acquired a place that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a florist in Terst, where the core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - supplied by the Osservatorian One - crimes are attributed to the country in which they happened.
So far, this group has remained within limits, and now let's take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistling at Mameli's anthem: it's not even a crime, but if you don't mind, it's indecent..."
