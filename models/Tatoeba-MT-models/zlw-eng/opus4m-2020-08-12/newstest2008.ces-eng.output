Inflation in Europe has jumped for food
Accelerating inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
The November price increase in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 percent in October, annual inflation was registered 3.1 percent, as announced by the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union.
The official forecast was only 3%, said Bloomberg.
Contrary to the US, UK and Canadian issuance banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate, with a reduction in the price of raw materials and falling unemployment leading to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation below 2%, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must discourage inflation so that it doesn't have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation was 3.3 percent of the 15-year-old record, rising from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent in Spain.
Inflation in the euro area has sprung upwards due to rising food and energy prices.
The wheat term prices have increased by 88 percent, and the soya rate has reached its highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and milk products.
The price of oil on the world market this year has risen by 52 percent, and last month it has already cost one barrel of black gold almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will fall from 2.1 percent to 2.5 in 2008, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the level of 12 months of inflation in the next 3-4 months will continue to be around 3 percent, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to double its interest rates in 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement increased significantly after a long period of stagnation to the beginning of December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of Socialists the Gallupus Institute has never measured such low - 13% support.
In the case of certain voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the voters of the opposition - would be more than two-thirds (71 %) of the aid compared to the fifth support of the MFA.
According to a survey below the threshold for entry into Parliament, MDF and the SZDZS are two percent support for the entire population.
Among certain voters of the party there are supporters of both camps by one percent more.
The view of the public on the economy has worsened even given the previous minimum - the ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be clearly very bad, so high - 41%, while according to the next 46%, the situation is quite bad.
Families are assessing the change in their material situation after spring and summer more promising prospects now more pessimistic.
As for next year, more of the population is expected with further deterioration and only a tenth with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of the respondents, most of all of the Gallupa Institute's current surveys, judged that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
Ference Gyurcsány believes or believes very much 13 percent, while Viktor Orbán has a 38 percent share of supporters.
The Prime Minister doesn't believe 54 percent, the President of the Fidesz movement 27 percent.
One of the indicators for the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without changing the government.
While after last October's riots, the government and the Prime Minister considered it desirable 35 percent, at present only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) see the solution only in the launch of the new elections.
For the sake of interest in the referendum, it is clear that 60 percent of the respondents replied to the question concerning their possible participation, that they would certainly come to the referendum and that another 20 percent would probably come.
For comparison, the "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly only be attended by 55 percent and the other 15 percent considered their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be doubtless on the basis of the current intentions.
The school would say no to 74, doctor's fees 79 and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only within people who certainly promise to participate, the introduction of a school fee, doctor fees and hospital fees would reject 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive one is Auchan, nearly a fifth of which turned Tesco on
The hypermarkets in the Budaörsian trade triangle maintained last year, with an average of 16% increase in the price level, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article of the Journal of Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of the Napi Gazdaság daily in the Budaörsian Trade Triangle rose by an average of 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets there was an increase of over a thousand forints in the price.
Since prices in the supermarkets "flyed out" in December last year, percentage of them did not show such a drastic increase due to the previous high base.
However, it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that what they could have bought last year would not be worth even ten thousand forints.
The consumer basket of the Daily Economy in the investigated hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003 there was a consumer basket of 6 800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but they very much undercut the crusades of breasts, nuts and also poppy.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to those of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a pound of bread even for 139 forints.
Competition did not go below 200 forints with the product price.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of a two litre Coca Coke in a return bottle was below 200 forints, so there was also an advance product of only 257 forints.
This year, however, according to Napi Gazdaság Auchan's consumer basket, it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the consumer basket prices of Napi Gazdaság increased by 15 percent compared to the prices of Cora's Christmas last year, while Tesco and Auchan increased by approximately 18 percent.
When compared to last year's highest and this year's lowest value of the consumer basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest was 21 percent.
In forints, the increase was an average of 1 480.
The average price increase last year was 1 206 forints, with prices being affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has been disrupted by the trade, the trading houses have clearly not been able to decide how large the price margins are to be established for each product, as they have not been able to predict the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of the product in question poorly, he may lose significant profit due to the price margin adjusted to the volume of circulation.)
Due to VAT, last year the price increase in the consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság showed so extremely that the price of the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than in 2006, while for the cheapest the price difference of all 844 forints everywhere was made.
This year there was no extreme difference, the most expensive basket now cost 1 630 forints more than last year, and also the cheapest one to turn 1 284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase appeared, in less than 20 months, the daily consumption in hypermarkets more than 30 percent.
(This is, inter alia, not entirely confirmed by the Central Statistical Office's data: it measured, in the case of several basic foods, an increase in prices exceeding 30 per cent within 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
However, in the latter case, according to the consumer basket of the Daily Economy, this seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, which is quite expensive in the last year, showed price growth in terms of the basis and, in the worst case, less than 10 percent.
The flour suppliers seem to be taking stronger positions than egg suppliers, and they have managed to enforce drastic price increases in international chains as well.
Hypermarkets in a business golden triangle don't complain, they're still reporting on a good year.
In our experience, most customers in three visited shops no longer care about prices.
They're buying everything, they're taking durable food on pay.
On Wednesday morning, in all three supermarkets, there were long queues at the cash registers, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, in the country, turnover is lower, many international chains complain to research firms that sales are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, it is saved on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infections have been registered in hospitals due mainly to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overload of personnel stopping diseases do not help, says the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places, it also saves on disinfectants.
A recent MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who got into the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
Similar infections occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after that he had to come back with MRSA infection and due to the bacteria found in his system, there was also one important operation that could not be performed.
By this December, 1 094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the Nesocomialis Surveillance National System, as reported by Karolina Böröczová, the head of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens of the disease have been registered in hospitals with certainty, others are not known.
Almost two-thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxaciline, resistant to gold staphylococcus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) has a third of the people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. carotid inflammation, tonsilitis, skin infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered excessively or inappropriately, they develop from a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics of bacteria, which is very resistant to antibiotics and which is rapidly spreading in inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, if the immune system is temporarily or permanently functioning poorly in patients with a weakened body, low body weight or in patients in years, it can cause serious hospital infections, such as early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the hospital’s chief physician, there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, and similar infections are part of daily practice in hospitals.
"The infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the cause of the disease is not investigated."
It resists antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the treating staff are treated in rubber gloves and in a mask and to treat them we have the necessary antibiotics," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined whether MRSA is present in their system, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and conditions in domestic hospitals are not favourable to prevent the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröczová.
As this infection is symptomatic in hospitals and homes for seniors, hospitals received should check and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
This also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these examinations.
The most common cases are revealed when a patient suffers from a noticeable MRSA infection, said the chief of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strong recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or that a microbiological examination is carried out to avoid drug resistance, but even the hospital does not comply with it in all cases.
The collection of microbiological samples is even rarer in the basic, or outpatient treatment of patients, said Karolina Böröczová.
Save on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most often spread among patients through medical personnel.
This is why it plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, but also in hospitals there are serious shortcomings.
MRSA is transmitted by both tissue infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients in the conditions of domestic hospitals.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close together, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz said, we can also see that there are few caregivers in hospitals that are in a negative material situation, saving up on disinfectants, and patients are very low, thus increasing the chances of developing infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are proven to be less or further spread of the cause of the disease can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA is a huge expense for health insurance companies and is therefore being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has drawn up a prevention programme for MRSA and a reduction in its incidence.
The programme appears to be successful, according to published data, showing an infection of MRSA in England decreasing trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistent pathogens (including MRSA), or hospital infections caused by these agents, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident wasn't drunk.
The official expert report in the case of police captain XXII, which caused the fatal accident, is finished.
It can be ruled out that the police captain XXII, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday who resigned from his post, would be driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, was informed by the spokesperson of Attila Morvai's Supreme State Office on Friday after the expert review of the case was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation, which had already stated that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The then director of the Police Directorate XXII of the district struck down on Tuesday in Lajos Kossutha Street in XXII. circuit with his own personal car at the turn of a 55-year-old man who entered before him when crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The latter fact that the pedestrian went outside the zebra, in fact according to the rules of road traffic is not easing the circumstances, the turning car must therefore take precedence.)
After moving to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these events, the District Police Director resigned from office and applied for a transfer to retirement, as reported by the police because he was so shaken by the case.
In the case, the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been working with state officials conducting investigations from the outset.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks totalling EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed in Budapest by the Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for Hungarian budget financing for transport and environment projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund, with the parties already concluding a loan contract of EUR 100 million, and the contract now signed relates to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also serves to finance projects related to education.
The EIB approved EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, the use of the remaining EUR 150 million may take place later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the Parties have signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which will primarily be used by the budget for the Debrecín University's research and development project.
There was also a speech at the meeting about the 4th metro route.
The Parties agree that, once Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the financing of the subway, it will return to whether and how the original Treaty should be modified.
According to János Veres, this can happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary since 1990.
The interest on loans provided by the EIB with an 8-year waiting period and without a commitment commission shall be linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is overwhelming - the attention of the whole of Europe turns to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys on the ever-inexpensive, but fast-tracking EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European target for the purchase of real estate is no doubt Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seashore.
The most part of the mountains are the Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the seashore and Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balčik.
According to the analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, investors and the central part of the country will be interested sooner or later - for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabro, Elena, Triavna - and more and more interested people are also shopping in the vicinity of the completely cheap city of Rue.
Sofie's capital is also a promise of attractive possibilities, business and office space promises the highest return.
Bulgaria is best placed to turn into one of Europe’s most attractive golf paradises, becoming next to the summer and winter seasons sought for the destination of the journeys in the next two seasons.
Predictive investors are already buying in large quantities, such as around Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers come from England, but also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, there are traditionally many Russian customers in the Black Sea and in the ski paradises.
Foreign buyers climb into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers buy either refurbished property worth 50-100 thousand euros or lost old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then refurbished.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, and it is important for them to be close to the big city, shops and usually a local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of the cottage (Bulgaria was among the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of rising value in the medium or long term.
Real estate treatment in the capital is continuous, as demand is getting stronger.
Although the lowest real estate prices in the European Union are in Bulgaria, they have grown by 21 percent annually over the last five years.
The rise in real estate prices is significantly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian six percent
According to the information of the Minister for the Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor will be closed on Tuesday, and after the Wednesday official opening, the international conference on the climate regime will continue after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Travel Map, which addresses the efforts following the reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, they are being debated with a storm between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it now does not wish to discuss the exact numbers, although they tend to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020, given the 1990 situation.
The next big question of the conference is whether developed countries will, in addition to reducing emissions, also take on the provision of both material and technological assistance to the countries that are referred to it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member management board, probably under the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the United Nations - we can read in Piac és Profit.
Hungarian six percent
The Minister for the Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in efforts to global climate protection and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, irrespective of the success of the adoption of the 'post-2012 agreement', and is prepared to commit to up to 30 % reduction in the event that other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments corresponding to their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had a reduction target of 5.2 per cent, with 8 per cent committed to the then 15 EU Member States.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will fulfill. - is recalled in the Ministry of the Environment press release.
Bali is a great deal because an international agreement on long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would not be until 2012 with certainty. In this case, the commitments to reduce the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed up by a new emissions reduction system, the need for which also the UN International Climate Change Scientific Council, the IPCC, which is the Nobel Peace Prize bearer, pointed out in its latest report.
This would lead to a delay in emissions and an inevitable increase in Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversibly consequences.
The British army is recruiting on YouTube
British military units publish video-sharing servers from events in Iraq and Afghanistan popularizing themselves.
First, YouTube liked the British Air Force (RAF): Special Forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, announced by the BBC.
Recordings, made by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Command Command of the Kandahar combat operation and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
More than 75,000 people have already looked at the "channel" in this form on the Internet.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the UK Department of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original intention to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they are also good to become familiar to the general public with the real goal of the presence of the army abroad.
"Promotion published in this form compared to traditional television recruitment commercials is almost nothing," said the BBC defence expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it also has a certain political message in it, as the special form confirms the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government."
The Americans made the game
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully prepared, censored recordings, amateur videos also appear on the server, including the death of soldiers: in a bit hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers talk about losses, but do not show a bloody form of combat.
In fact, many of the videos from the fighting sites in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during the sharp deployment, have already been released by the British army.
Americans are recruiting a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can through a more or less faithful simulation get directly into the skin of the soldiers.
The Ministry will have Christmas with raffle and peacocks
Mónika Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, seems not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, where she will say goodbye to the Pageanas and Coffee in 2007.
At some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, and elsewhere they will conjure the officials of the Christmas atmosphere with raffle and toast.
A party, a Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - so enjoy the power.
The state authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defence will host the most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year, but it is not expected by its employees.
At the holidays of orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, during the missionary Christmas guests of the family of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but they will also hold a reception for journalists.
The resort devotes 25 million to the atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will throw themselves out of the hives compared to the other ministries.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4 320 000 forints, and of the six hundred employees of the Ministry is expected to be around three hundred fifty guests.
Resort will stick to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but it will also come to various performances and will also draw raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4 700 000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Justice Council (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the program.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than 400 invited.
One department of NFÜ seems to be invited to another Christmas party: there will be a tender company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
To this end, they rented the building of the Vígszínház theatre.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we were unable to reach the relevant person.
There's no need for a suit.
The OIT building was not only hosted by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which instead of Christmas held on December 7th the dance of St. Lucie.
However, the OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party began with a health minister, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the [origo] portal at the ball, no mandatory evening dress or suit was required at all.
Puritan's party is going to be prepared by the health, labor and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and a celebration for employees for 400 000 forints in its own building.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth is not even officially inviting her coworkers to a Christmas party, but to a final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests will receive only coffee and peacocks according to the press release, so only 350 000 forints will be enough for the party.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply drink in the aule of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting at which 436 workers are expected in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party she devotes 2,500 forints to the guest - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and toasts.
Since he is Minister János Veres, the workers of PM Christmas have been celebrating in a similar way every year.
The atmosphere of the party will, however, be lacking, the officiality amplifies not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time of the event.
The farm centre is held on January 20th by the New Year's reception, and Ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place at the Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the Municipal Orchards, and according to the Ministry's announcement, 1,000 forints per person are allocated to 100 guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short health minister and end with a small hospitality.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not host Christmas parties at all, the [origo] portal has been communicated by the relevant press department.
They couldn't tell the award of Christmas celebrations by the Ministry of the Environment in the press department.
In any case, 400 people were invited to a party at the Museum of Arts.
Going to a giant strike
The League of Unions and the National Union of Workers' Councils (MOS) will establish their strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's time limitless strike.
A protest public meeting is held on Saturday, on Monday - the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - work will be stopped.
The action will certainly cause a serious interruption of transport, as the railway transport will almost completely stop and the employees of the Budapest Transport Undertaking (BKV) will strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League will meet together with the National Union of Workers Councils with details jointly organized Monday strikes.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which will coordinate Monday's action.
A protest public meeting is held on Saturday, and the union joining the strike will stop working indefinitely if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the termination of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not accept the Health Insurance Act in the end, the unions will immediately withdraw the challenge to strike.
However, if legislation is voted, strike committees will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to the Parliament's meeting on Monday, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will not be voted until late evening or, if necessary, late night hours.
Due to the early strike on Monday, serious traffic interruptions can be expected: work on the railway will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning part of Budapest's public transport can be stopped and more than half of Volán's companies can be stopped.
At the same time, half of the runway will also be closed in many places in the country.
A number of trade unions and civil organizations joined the challenge, whose list is kept up to date on the site of the League.
Some organizations have been advising a strike for an indefinite period, others have declared temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV) and the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, while more and more people were travelling on the railway at the beginning of Christmas holidays.
According to the previous reports, from the beginning of operation to 13 hours will strike at BKV, from 7 to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, the four-hour strike will be organised by the Union Union of Workers in the Energy Industry of LIGA, to the 2-, respectively, 2-8-hour termination of work called on the Union of Teachers and the Democratic Union of Teachers.
The Union of Hungarian physicians will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Union of Workers in Health and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), which belongs to the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), organizes a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements laid down by the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for a reform of health insurance and submit a new concept to the public.
The second requirement is that a new way of calculating pensions is introduced gradually from the next year.
Thirdly, the possibility of inclusion in the scheme before 2010 is ensured for early retirement for the relevant fields of employment.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) falling under the trade union Liga does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning railway branches and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarszágért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Institute of Political Capital, increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole area in several respects.
The company's "attention to risk" writes: in the context of the Hungarian Guard's activities, the greatest political risk is that "violent ethnic tensions between the Roma and the non-Roma people of Hungary may occur in the short term".
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to lead to such an action - adds the research institute.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the biggest negligences of Hungarian political leaders: "The public debate on the Roma issue has been left by representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict."
This deepens the problem, makes it impossible for normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - evaluates the institute.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard according to the research institute, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media, "to a large extent the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards faith in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which have been getting more and more publicity and vehemence since the autumn of 2006, is that several organizations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which are called "national Home Army associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while they openly proclaim - even armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the case of natural disasters, invasion of the country, disruption of order), in addition to pointing out the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
He further notes: all this is happening in a way that seeks to wrap up all sorts of political efforts built on the resistance of society to politics and parties in civilian clothing.
The emphasising of civilization and form of society, therefore, in the case of such groups, is not only a way to avoid legal pitfalls in judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a factor in increasing risk from the point of view of neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, Hungary's City has been pointing out as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring states, and the ultranationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries want to apologize to their own anti-Hungary policy by referring to the formation of Hungarian Guards.
All of this can affect the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so that the political risks to the area as a whole have increased.
As he writes, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the foundation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Romani riots that broke out in one of the Sofian districts (Crassy Poljana).
She used this BNU to set up a guard, with the aim of the organization being "national domestic".
In the past 17 years, according to her, there was a "Gypsy Terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained inactive and indifferent, similar to the Political Capital Institute.
It adds that the initiative triggered a turbulent discussion by the Bulgarian public.
As he goes on to say, increasing the risk of ethnic conflicts signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Romani organizations that they will create their own cities as a sign of resistance.
As the Hungarian Guard’s current activity shows similarities to the Bulgarian National Guard’s activity, it is not excluded that even the Hungarian Roma will respond to a similar threat by setting up their own home defence, we can read in the warning of the risks developed by the Political Capital Institute.
At the press office's request, Attila Juhász, research director of the Institute of Political Capital: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, the risk analysis is published each year and, if it finds out something that could affect the change in risk, it informs the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The holidays aren't open everywhere
In Hungary, the days are well-established by law and it has become common practice to move working days around the holidays, which is expected less times next year.
There are no uniform holidays in the European Union or in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and national holidays and days of rest at work.
The days of work are usually related to church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is off work - for the New Year so that people can rest after New Year's Eve.
In the course of the year, we have 11 free holidays in total.
The national festival is the 15th of March celebrating the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, May 1st, work, November 1st and 2nd, we remember dead relatives and friends.
Besides, it's two days of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend, it has become a practice to shift the working day if we only work one day before or after a free holiday.
However, the price for extended weekends is that before Saturdays we remain in the workplace and in school.
When we work on the day immediately preceding or following the festival, the Minister of Labour has been working for many years in a special decree.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and workers employed by them, to public employees and to persons in the public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or, in view of their intended use, also operate on business days.
This year there will be a change in the working order just around the end of the year: life in the country will almost stop as soon as 24 December, because most people will, according to their experience, work ahead in advance between Christmas and New Year's Eve or take advantage of the holiday they have saved.
The next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around the holidays of work so that the workers can stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, 26 April, will be a working day so that it can be, on the contrary, Friday, May 2nd.
The next move is related to the 23rd of October: on Saturday 18th of October, instead of Friday 24th.
The end of the year, however, will be able to take place completely in the sign of holidays next year, because from December 24th they will have almost nonstop holidays everywhere, even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six discouraging little things to piss off your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, innocent lies that we will hardly notice again: all of this "torns" the everyday days at the workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these little unpleasantnesses or put on gloves and unclear situations that others can anger, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague told you.
That you missed a meeting for that?
In a better case, he regrets it and tries to correct it, or he calls the marketing department and says he forgot to deliver the message (this is less common solutions).
The most common thing is a one-time apology.
Before there's any awkward apology, it's good to think about what you could do to prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues, and consciously try to prevent it.
Do you borrow something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than reaching for some writing, office supplies, or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on your desk yesterday, but he's gone by morning?
Or on the table of one of your colleagues, did you discover your pen, which you thought was lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they will rightly be angry at you for digging into their affairs.
Do not take the envelopes or sticky papers out of your office, because it may be uncomfortable if you run out of time, and you will need them immediately.
The rumors about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the rumors.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don't put your messages (housewives) on everyone's nose about the private lives of your colleagues!
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, don't abuse his trust!
Lock up what you have heard, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know about his affairs.
You report your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and appeal to severe headaches, you report your absence because you are not well, or think that today you would rather rest, thinking that your work, urgent tasks and work that have a certain deadline will have to be done for you by someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day or that something can happen that will require you to stay at home, report it so that your colleagues and managers will not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Scratching, hinning, telephoning
Have you dived into a job that will take you away from the humbling of your colleague?
Did you accidentally witness a phone call that would be better off not hearing at all?
Do not disturb your coworkers by scratching, singing, by talking loudly (innit above your head), by stabbing, by always clapping, by loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disturbing even when they are not being taken into a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you accusing others of mistakes?
If something is not in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame yourself for your forgetfulness to others!
Do not refer to any chaos in the office and noisy colleagues!
Recognize if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and correct the damage!
Ask how you could make things right, correct negligence!
Do you feel too at home in your office?
sweatpants and parrots: comfortable clothes at home, of course not suitable for the office!
Do not wear your clothes for leisure, even if your profession allows!
Don't be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in your usual dress - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When a person wants to please, he stops being interesting.
A connection in the usual morning traffic.
A special tune will be heard from the radio: the sound of violins to which electronic effects are connected.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes pace and the previous tone coloring is added bass, then the female choir joins as a real jewel.
There's a song at the Mr2 station called Wings of Love.
Domestic music life hasn't spoiled us for a long time with high-quality electronic pop.
But suddenly the traffic looks quite different because you're listening to the new album of Zagara.
The revelation of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions from the home digital underground, slowly changes the overall image, and although it is again in the fashion of garage rock with its beating into the guitar, even home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Five Churches and he also played in Yonderboi's band until finally - perhaps because two dubs do not fit into one bar - he published his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to penetrate until he was called to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ference Töröka's film "Szezon".
Its formation, played in the beginnings of smaller clubs, recognized the wider audience after their first album of 2002 included the 50 most important homemade albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as the only domestic entity determining developments that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt "in the course", although, of course, no one has asked them if they are satisfied with this sticker.
The band responded as it should: made a new, better album.
Now released an album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the name itself tries to create a connection with the initial flights in the Five Churches.
This is one verse from the composition of the old band Balázs Zságer.
A reference to the ethernic, flying would be in place, but next to the ethereal breath of this music now appeared - in line with the spirit, trend of the time - a louder guitar, influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, presented his album at the Millenaris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station Mr2 Petőfi, playing recently from morning till evening popular music, we began to find the rocking melodies of Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("underground Divas").
So everything's fine.
The Hvg.hu portal interviewed Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question of how much remains what you play with the marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: Definition of peripheral music doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two different caste of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternatives and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it can only be created for sale, which makes it commercial.
But even a good pop song can come from an honest inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude is also working, as it is adopted, independently of the language and state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in their 20s, but also older ones.
They are much more closely monitoring the changes in light music that take place around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where, and in what number your music is listening to?
B. Zs.: Of course, there is a good feeling that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we've never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born for purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen more at concerts where mutual influence already exists, but it is only hidden in inconspicuous changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that when one wants to suit the audience, it ceases to be interesting from that moment on.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He's working solo, and he's built his career rather from us west.
B. Zs.: We don't actually go his way, regardless of how our music sometimes tries to explain itself.
We are more of a team player who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it evolve.
At first, of course, we could not avoid our work being similar to Yonderboie's songs, for several of us separated from his band and went the other way.
hvg.hu: In the toplist of the station Mr2 Petőfi the composition Wings of Love came first.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, did you consciously open yourself to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We didn't plan to write a hit to sell the record.
There's more to the song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel.
Then came the idea to build this choir from the soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So we put together this six-member choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judith Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized into Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this exactly how you intended the song, or did the girls transform something into it?
B.Zs.: The composition had long existed in an instrumental version, then when the material was gathered on the board, we thought that something else would be needed for this song.
The herring of chords led to a singing party join him.
That very day, I sang him a melody later learned by the girls.
This whole thing worked out almost for the first time and it was so spontaneous.
I remember how it came to come to life, but of course, it took a diva to do that.
It wouldn't work that hard with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the board and at the concert it seemed like there were girls in the background.
They have no solo (except Judy Jay), they do not have their own role, they sing together and they are not louder than music, so music does not just accompany their singing.
They were standing in the back of the stage, too.
On purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
On the contrary, not wanting to divide solo roles is intentional.
Even this song is about us forgetting our egos, where we belong, where we belong, and just let those wings, the wings of love rise.
I wanted this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born to feel the others.
Hvg.hu: Which was the most work with?
B.Zs.: In fact, during the composition of music, even with one, heavier pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work the groove for a long time, then everything slowly found a place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That's still changing with the concert, even by the fact that I've already released the record.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Sam.
Cheating broker risked billions of undervalue
Deceptive embezzlement.
This is how the French bank giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Commercial Bank, refers to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel.
She lost almost five billion euros because of him.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to deal with his colleagues and, moreover, certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all large banking houses, the early crisis in the US mortgage market was recognised.
"He is mentally weaker," said his superiors, who sent him to the police.
However, according to Kerviel’s statement made by the French media, such as Le Monde, he was a man who had a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer he managed to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He sensed the occasion as early as the beginning of the year.
In February news began to appear that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or to those who have had problems with repayment in the past, will have problems.
But it had no impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he made the right bet.
At the end of the year, his profit went up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I made my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he didn't keep anything to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits to falsifying the records so that it doesn't come to light.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though his business became interested in Eurex.
The risk was profit.
Was he afraid he'd come after him?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to gradually develop into his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became a separate broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he'd never make as much money as anyone else.
"At my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal developments," Kerviel described to investigators.
But shortly after the start, the first great success came.
Allianz's stock earned EUR half a billion in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you.
"It's like a snowball," he told the cops.
But the bosses said they knew everything, or rather they suspected.
"As long as I made money, they kept their eyes closed."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend at mid-January, he wanted to destroy it.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I only chose four days for the past year.
A broker who doesn't have a vacation is a broker who doesn't want anyone looking at his records," Kerviel closed.
The Czech Republic has a chance to raise 365 billion
Yesterday, representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes, from which the Czech Republic can obtain EUR 14 billion in the coming years (approximately CZK 365 billion).
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels from 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go to traffic.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed next year with the amount of CZK 90.8 billion.
The Business and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative business.
Companies should be able to raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research as well as for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
In the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful in newly adopted countries.
The 20-year sentence for President Nicaragua has been confirmed by a court of law
On Thursday, a court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed a 20-year sentence for the former president of Arnold Aleman, who was sentenced in 2003 for fraud of 100 million dollars (almost CZK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 comes back behind bars, according to AP, it is not clear at this moment.
According to the President of the Board of Appeal, Ileana Pérez will now depend on the prison officials whether they let Alman serve his punishment at home or send him to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign businesses in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts were actually his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that was founded by Aleman to finance his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget unique?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
Last year, he passed through the support of the ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote on government distrust, nothing dramatic has happened this time.
The House of Deputies has approved this traditionally ignored, even though the most influential, law has calmly been passed.
It's a paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether it pleases or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is hidden behind the power rivalry of the government with the opposition.
That's why he pays much more attention to the media.
The question of politicians is much more interesting to the public than sharp numbers.
State budgets in past social democratic governments suffered three setbacks, which he cannot resolve for 2008 at once:
The first one is a high share of the mandatory, so-called authoritarian expenditure, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which last year was approved by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of malpractice first.
The third limit is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the deficits in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the state budget deficit.
He's in public and relatively under control.
The time bomb is, however, a deficit in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to taxes, fees and loans from banks, would obtain additional resources to invest, often headlessly issue bonds by which they disproportionately indebted their city halls.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by selling mass shares of energy and other grids that they received from the state from privatisation.
Now they no longer have this source.
If we just stick to the official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going on for several years, like the rest of the world, in the growth phase, constantly boasting the ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances right.
Instead, however, the state was increasingly indebted.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
It is a huge shame, which is mainly falling on past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have, in recent years, completely wasted themselves into gigantic dimensions.
Even though some of the populist spending approved this year before the elections has been cancelled, if the retirement limit and pension reform do not soon be shifted, then any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever rules it will be just the office.
It can be said with a small exaggeration that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing the majority of the paid money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolutionary one, but it can only suspend the repression of normal expenditure by mandate expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if past governments failed to manage what they could in the last ten years.
If we do not really want to see that ruling politicians become mere officials, then we must be patient and allow this not too strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and charges, peace of mind to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will allow a gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

The banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
Thus, more than $100 billion will enter the monetary markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the bank is auctioning interest rates for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion into the auction, and the next 24 will make the European and Swiss central banks available.
This is the first time after the attacks of 11 September that the national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This step is intended to address the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumał from the Economic Outlook Group advisory company in his report.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," said Baugał in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion because of outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions of losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what else can follow when they have decided on this procedure," said the chief economist ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend auctions to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with possible effects on the economic growth of the whole world.
Thus, the central banks decided that the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to lend money on the interbank market, could not be reduced.
This meant that banks were still concerned about mutual lending, even though the US, Canada and Britain central banks had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that central banks will contribute to the recovery of the crisis because they do not solve the fundamental problem, and that is the fall in the US real estate market.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is designed to most harm developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again commented on the issue of global warming.
Critics have now come to an end to the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not the green planet, he said that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mixture of government representatives and NGOs, but also a fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is just a fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that her theme was very important to him and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book appears in German translation, because, as he said, "I often only meet the cartoons of my opinions".
Now, then, the interested ones can read his unfailing attitudes.
Klaus recalled that he was not an climatologist, but, in his opinion, he had sufficient assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also a national economy.
The main conclusions of the book are that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no common view of the warming of the planet that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, as a person with totalitarian experience, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
He repeatedly explained on the questions of those present that he was not against the "reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
Driver's license didn't change 600 000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and did not change the old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that people can apply for an exchange so the authorities can still issue them a new card by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers would set off on the road without valid authorisation.
According to the authorities, the I.D. hasn't been exchanged mainly by those who don't want to drive anymore.
While the municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of a driver's license, the authorities in the metropolis are being flooded with applications and the interest in the exchange of the licence has increased this week.
The magistrate takes about 2,000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour waiting in the queues.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver's license.
Issuing a new card takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request an issue within a reduced period of five days.
In that case, the driver will pay 500 crowns.
Since January, motorists who fail to make the mandatory exchange of the licence by the end of the year and leave on the road without a valid driver's license will be threatened with a fine.
The wrongdoer will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But a cop can deal with a misdemeanor with a deal.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine shall be set at CZK 2500.
According to previous information, a fine could have been received from the city hall and a person who wasn't going anywhere.
He was supposed to pay 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had previously called on the authorities to be gentle and to impose a maximum thousand-dollar fine.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karl Hanzelka is not threatened with tens of thousands of fines.
According to him, the driver's license is a document for which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It's not a identity card that every person has to have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
Just take it or send it by post to the competent municipal authority.
At the end of the year, they will cease to apply licences issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, motorists must gradually replace other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it's about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court of First Instance reduced the penalties to detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are charged with criminal association with David Berdych's gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
With definitive effect, the Supreme Court of Prague decided to do so, thus reducing their sentences, one year and the other by two years.
Originally, it threatened the detectives of the Prague Department for the Fight against Organized Crime for 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's decision; it is possible only to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also accused in this case, but he is waiting for a first-line verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already received penalties in the sum of over 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the Regional Court recognised, in particular, the involvement in the robbery of 19 people, and today the Supreme Court dealt with the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have refused since the beginning of the investigation that this is a case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, provided information to criminals from police sources, covered individual robbery and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang turned in 30 percent for Opava and Koňařík.
The prosecution is a crime of a gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robbery, which has often suffered serious harm to health, but also abuse of public authority and illicit armament.
During home searches, the police discovered illegally held pistols, steel-core missiles, laser sightings, and a machine gun.
The gang, according to the charges, came to tens of millions of crowns by robbery.
In addition to nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already recognised the guilty of another Berdych robbery and a number of other people.
Other men in Berdych's neighborhood are testifying in another court, some cases have not yet been remedied before the court.
The main presentation has so far avoided Tomáš Pít and Maroš Šulejov, who reside in Irish custody, where they are waiting for final decisions on their issue to prosecute to the Czech Republic.
Children's exchange account: 12 million
In exchange for children in the hospital, the lawyer of damaged families Igor Veleba wants to pay 12 million crowns, plus court expenses.
For each of the mothers of three million, for the father of two million and for the children of a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for every parent.
Ondrej hospital’s attorney has therefore substantially disagreed with Veleba’s proposal.
"We reject this request, it is very high," said Dostál after today's meeting.
"But in order to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has had to draw up.
We'll find out if it's even worth it.
But we remain in the view that it will be in the statistic for everyone," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns in every month she didn't raise her biological daughter.
He served Veleb as the basis for the negotiation of a compensation expert opinion prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motol.
Parents of children according to psychiatry and psychiatry experts suffered psychological injury and stress in different degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they were faced with regret that the replacement of newborns was not prevented.
Women are more vulnerable to the news of trauma, and what is happening right now has summed up the contents of Veleb.
Veronica and Nikola exchanged nurses at the Třebíč obstetrics last December 9th.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermáková to Przybyslavice and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablonecov.
Hetman Vysočina Miloš gave each of the families CZK 100,000 in return for the expenses incurred by mistake of the Třebíč hospital, which the region is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are by law insured for liability for damage.
In the event of a mistake, they must reach the reserve fund, exceptionally they may apply for the assistance of the founder.
The courts have so far awarded people relatively low compensation, the sums were calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup Lost The Valash Kingdom
Bolek Soup lost a dispute over the brand of the Valash Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, for the first time the sign was used by the Wallachian King, but the project was built by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with an actor.
Soup wasn't part of the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and the client appeals.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolek Polivka," said the lawyer after the trial Polivk.
According to him, everyone in the kingdom of Valash remembers an actor and a comedian.
Harabis has the same opinion.
"There's been almost a decade of work behind us.
Getting money and making up events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and might have something to do with it.
They want to parasite on our work," he said.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the Wallachian king first used soup on his TV show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzo rich.
But at that time, it had nothing to do with the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From the original recession, the trade and lucrative business activity was established, followed by Harabiš, the establishment of the Valaš Kingdom.
In 1997 Poměvka agreed to indicate his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also stated that Harabiš had only used the bare idea that Poměvka had published in the manner of his business purpose.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka's Valaš Kingdom project certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabis and his team, who intensively devoted themselves to him.
The cooperation of the disputed parties continued today until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have begun to accumulating between Polivka and Harabiš, which culminated in the decomposition of the "King of Boleslav I. elected all the time".
The singer Jarmila Šulák took the lead in the kingdom as a mother’s queen.
In 2002, Poměvka brought an action against Harabis and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearly, Harabishim could bring in the planned worship for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal the details and timing yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like riding kings in Slovakia.
The King should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Soup can apply," Harabiš added.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VT: disappearing prejudice
In fact, I've never fantasized much Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of the sorting, the driving and also the production could be described as underaverage.
But there's now a successor to Peugeot 207 on the market, and it's much better.
And a combination called SW goes a little further, and I have no choice but to think.
When I was testing a classic hatchback Peugeot 207, I complained about, for example, the back seat space.
That's the end of the complaint, because the bodywork of the comms means that they won't even have a two-meter length in this direction.
Flight through the world
I'll cross the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself.
It's a pretty good design, where I have only one excuse for the poor central tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more designer invention here, since the car already looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The side line also improved significantly against the 206 model.
As far as the space is concerned, there is also a sense of a rise in the dimensions of the bodywork.
The lack of space above the head disappears in the compost.
Luggage lockers
So the main thing on this car is his bagel.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (including through the rear window) and as a decently stocky one.
The deaf spots are equipped with restraint rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
They don't interfere, they can be stretched out, and they can hold on to heavy objects.
But let's stop together over the volume.
This is according to the tables in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is rather against competition the average value.
Not against the best-selling car in the Czech Republic, Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation of the youngboleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is much behind 52 liters.
On a trip abroad or when loading the carriage, this value is critical.
But if I had to raise the positive, I still have to mention the floor straight after the backrests of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6 l ignition four-cylinder with a power output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old who drives a family hatchback should look like.
She's quiet, she's low-consumption, and she's mostly pulling.
If I compare it to a harmful similarity, which sometimes feels like she's got a stuffed rag in the exhaust, I can only be thrilled with it.
Pricelist hints
The price of the car is not folk.
However, we must bear in mind that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a ignition 14th for 329 900 CZK is still available.
Our aggregate costs from CZK 410 900, which is quite enough.
The Premium equipment tested will then add the equipment for another 80,000 CZK on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, electric rear window control...
The car just costs everything 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but you can count the supplemental equipment at Fabie's and you can get a lot like that.
So there's nothing left to do but decide for the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is failing
Children from Eastern European countries are increasing in British schools, which raises concerns about the further development of local education for local residents.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is still facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the indigenous population are becoming violent.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes are beginning to escalate between local residents and Slovak immigrants.
Fighting, bullying, and fighting amongst the pupils also became a part of the relationship between parents.
The situation went so far as to keep the police from holding a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old student with an iron pole.
Guilty defends the boy from insulting her with racist abuses.
The police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
Men's girls reportedly used racist notes to throw stones at him.
"When we went home, some boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he turned on us with apples and pears, and then he discovered his ass," the mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant incident for The Times.
Complaints are both sides.
One of the local residents even referred to disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere at British schools between local and immigrants is becoming tense.
There are 70 000 Slovaks registered in Britain who have come here to work.
About 30,000 Slovak students then attend British schools.
Cuba the prettiest island of the Caribbean
For visitors, he really is an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled if you choose correctly.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea you will find it in full and even richer detail.
Only on one island you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
As Spanish, Cuba used to be the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that a human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a storehouse and a translation centre of the treasures that the Spanish in America robbed and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel grew up in the late 1920s.
He had it built by one of the bosses of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially for prohibitions) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses were built, and large boulevards were driven by cars, which belonged to the iconic symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojmiar he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio left their signatures to the stars of showbusiness and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls in Bodeguita in Havana.
At the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, they mix you a cocktail as you wish.
And those cult cars from the '50s still drive around Havana because once imported gills and violets in that salty and wet breeze have been rotted.
Even though Havana, especially its oldest part, is greatly degraded, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere around there.
Other places are also turning into beauty, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much money, its development is green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguin and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another taste, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by train drivers.
The cane of large plantations was tied to sugarmakers on narrow tracks by steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been restored for many decades, so there are working machines, whose peers are only in museums elsewhere.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not miss.
And so, about Varader, or Havana, you don't have to write much down.
Perhaps just to remind you that there is a museum in Hemingway, mentioned above, and who likes this writer should not miss a visit.
Valley of Vinales One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the valley of Vinales in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows out of limestone.
Mogotos, limestones, and rocks are steeply lifted from the bottom of the valley and fertile soils have been caught in their cavitys, so that even the windy rocks are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet with its final form if you visit any of the Havana cigars.
Maybe it's interesting for someone to know that Major Zeman's show was in Chile.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth brought him a trade of slaves and sugar.
Richness has become a beauty and exhibition of a small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, markedly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountains of Escambray, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road that connected the region to the rest of the country.
She isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing was done, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If you have more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, it is worth to look at interesting places nearby, such as Playa Ancón beach, or the valley of the Confections.
In the evening it is necessary to visit Casa de la Música, who lives after dark and the music in it is quiet at dawn.
Baracoa
A town in the east of Cuba is called the most beautiful on the island.
Of course, that is what affects the path itself.
The two roads that run there from Guantánama must cross high and divided mountains and pass through nature, which the human activity has hardly noticed.
The east island of Cuba has registered UNESCO thanks to its unbroken nature on the world heritage list.
They make the best chocolates in the church have the Columbus Cross (in fact formed about a hundred years after Columbus' cruise) and from the hillside where the former castle stands and today's Hotel El Castillo, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestro mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobre, about the santeria, the African religions that confess the descendants of the former slaves, there are many pages to describe.
But as they say, it's better to see one day.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, the Americans say
Few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan according to the United States.
According to the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should draw a specific plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place according to the idea, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, by the representatives of the countries that have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, eight participating States are discussing further plans and coordination of allies today.
While the United States, through the Minister of Defense Robert Gates, has called on NATO units to become more active this week, the United Kingdom sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
"Afghanistan's development is tangible, but military power can only be part of a solution.
The next one is to allow the residents to initiate further economic and security development themselves," said the BBC British Defence Minister Des Browne.
Ninety percent
According to U.S. military records, the activity of Afghan insurgents has been the highest in the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, in the southern Helmand province by even 60 percent.
NATO countries have approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of which are in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached the same limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
In particular, they ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
"We will have to seriously think about the specific goals for the next few years and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I'm not happy about what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is little," Reuters De Hoop told Reuters De Hoop at the end of three-day interviews with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There have also been disputes among the participating countries over the past few months about whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticised for passivity.
"Germans have quite a number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and combat claims on them are not as high as on us in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan valets revealed: The Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in the material, supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into counterattack and printed a picture of the British unit during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The state debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
There is more than 84.000 crowns of government debt in each Czech Republic.
The total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152,8 billion thanks to the improved development of the state budget management.
The Czech Republic's government debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
In nine months this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
From June, however, it decreased by CZK 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed today its state debt data at the beginning of October.
There is more than 84.000 crowns in debt to each Czech Republic.
Over the whole of last year, the state indebted itself by more than CZK 111 billion.
"For now, due to a lower deficit for next year, it seems that we could only overcome the limit of a trillion crowns in 2009.
The debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns next year," said iHNed.cz analyst Patria Finance David Marek.
Similarly, the analyst Next Finance Vladimír Pikora sees this: "To overcome one trillion we could get through the course of 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could shift to 2010.
But I do not anticipate this change," he said.
Debts are growing
The government debt forms central government debt and is mainly generated by the accumulation of government deficits.
The government debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
So far, internal debt has increased by CZK 38.5 billion to CZK 719.4 billion.
The foreign debt of the state has so far increased CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called commercialable sovereign debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the State debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt for the first to third quarter increased by 13 percent year-on-year, which is really a lot to how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly in bonds where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to deal with when there is a pension reform," Pikoro commented.
Better than expected
The 2007 financing and debt management strategy shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152,8 billion thanks to the improved development of the state budget management.
The amount is mainly the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the estimated CZK 91.3 billion.
In addition, it is planned maximum resources for the Czech consolidation agency of CZK 13,3 billion, a 10 billion pension reserve, the financing of government bonds for CZK 43 billion and loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to CZK 1,8 billion.
Today, a woman is due to appear at a court in Khartoum for giving her name to a teddy bear
The British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced by one Khartoum Tribunal on Thursday night to 15 days in prison and expelled, as her lawyer stated.
The British woman was accused of letting six to seven-year-olds give the teddy bear the name Mohammed, despite the fact that any representation of the prophet Islam is forbidden.
She was punished by a whip.
This four-year-old British teacher, acting at the Unity High School in the Sudan Khartoum, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, our story begins in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven - year - old students to select a name for a class teddy bear.
"Eight names sound from the mouth of the children, among them Hasan, Abdulah and Mohammed," says the school director Robert Boulos.
After a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children will eventually be chosen as the most popular name by Mohammed.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very widespread first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a label: "My name is Mohammed".
The teddy bear himself had no label with this name, but it is difficult in the mere depiction of a prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' fellow Muslims, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret asking her children to vote for a name", according to him it is only "innocent error".
This is the view of many teachers who describe it as "very careful of their pupils" and add that "never in class talk about religion".
Recall that Mohammed’s first name is also the second most commonly given first name in the UK, with 14 different ways written in English.
This first name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way to honor the prophet (it is often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of that first name?
For example, is it possible to give them to a toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbian and Kosov Albanians ended up in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning 6th and at the same time the last round of interviews without able to overcome the different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on status", said European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during the press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area was "at stake" and called on Belgrade and Pristina to take care of their commitments to keep peace and were prepared for dialogue even after negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period", he added, "it is evident that the situation is tense".
Negotiations end on 10 December
The Negotiators of the Troika, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their last trip to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of a province of 90 percent of Albanian-speaking populations could appear in a clearer light on 10 December, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the UN, in August of this year, commissioned Troika with a new negotiation.
Americans and Europeans are counting on the talks to be concluded on 10 December.
On the other hand, the Russians, who have previously blocked Kosovo's independence in the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue after this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", said Bocan-Charchenko.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration of the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Priština declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," the president of the Kosovo Authority announced Fatmir Sejdius in a baden hotel where this "last chance" has taken place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of Kosovo's Albanians and future prime minister of the province, regretted.
However, he added that the plan of autonomy introduced by Belgrade "belongs to the past which led to murders and deportations".
"Domino effect"
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tadić believes that the compromise still comes and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the possible unilateral independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in an area which is still unstable due to the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"It does not mean anything to Serbia," he said, "it is impossible to compromise."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong solely to the Security Council in which its Russian ally has the right to veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"The only solution acceptable for Serbia is the Security Council", said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"This meeting lasted two years.
It must end as it began: in the seat of the Security Council."
He replied to the journalists Fatmir Sedjiu that "the final word on status will be the Kosovo parliament" and added that if an unilateral declaration of independence was made by Albanian-speaking residents, it would be "in agreement" with the West.
Bush made a deal with the Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland called out of his drive, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed on the immediate opening of negotiations with the intention to resolve 60 years of dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything in his power to help them conclude the peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end colonial activities, declared Bush and recalled the obligations for both sides of the "road map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, aim to "conclude a peace treaty that would solve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues".
This statement includes three questions which are at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future border of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees banished during the conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of today's state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor after the US president and stressed that the subsequent negotiations should be "total and thorough" and that it should touch all aspects of the solution, with the mention of "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things".
Mr Olmert then spoke to the tribunal, who expressed the view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it must be be assumed that it should be concluded in the course of 2008".
Bush defined the end of 2008 as the term for the implementation of his "visa of two states", Palestinian and Israeli, existing alongside each other.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has made a commitment to Bush in this sense before it has decided to take part in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries offering peace to Israel in exchange for leaving all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including Eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "the crucifixion in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", considers Prince Saud in an interview which he gave to an Arabic-speaking newspaper, which was secured by Saudi capital.
According to the D.A., the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the black chronicle, the official versions do not match what is said amongst people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the French State Police General Inspection (IGPN), a police car was driven on Sunday shortly after 5 p.m. by Louise-Michel in Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in intervention mode, but it was on patrol and passed at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, without the side lights on", explains the police source.
Kawasaki's green motorcycle, "unregistered, and therefore without the permission to ride on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men with no helmet, was driving "very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit the police car from the left after he didn't prefer the right," said one police officer.
The blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The condition of the car (broken front, shattered windscreen, broken bumpers) shows the shock.
The prosecutor of Pontois (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that IGPN had assigned the investigation of "the acts of involuntary killing and failure to provide assistance to persons at risk", which was taken into account by the director of the Départementale de la sété publique du Val-d'Oise (Director of the Regional Police Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by IGPN excludes the responsibility of police officers for the accident at this stage.
According to the official, three witnesses of the accident who were questioned on Sunday night confirmed "the police version, namely that the minimotor approached them quite quickly from the left".
Some kind of a mark, no doubt caused by the ground clipping yesterday, showed that both vehicles remained stuck until the police car was able to freeze.
The vehicles have been secured and passed through technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on both victims' bodies yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, at Villiers-le-Bel, there was a lot of talk among people about policemen leaving the scene without giving two young people first aid.
IGPN also had, in all caution, to rule out "any serious offence" at this point.
"It is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more research and with which to be very careful," noted the police source.
The "Libération" daily met with an eyewitness of those few moments following the accident.
One of his windows leads right to where the accident took place.
"We immediately, together with our cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, ran down to try to resurrect them," says this witness.
There was nothing we could do."
Then he saw "a limping, completely scared cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young and the fourth spoke on the phone."
In the face of rapidly growing tensions and confidently present that the situation of young people is hopeless, the police were taken by car of colleagues who, in the meantime, arrived at the site.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the cops left."
They also massaged the heart, but in vain.
"Don't let anyone claim that the police authorities didn't rush the young people to help.
These young men were given first aid.
Fire department arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
The tension in Pakistan is growing
On Monday, Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations since the declaration of emergency by General Musharraf, two days before.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against emergency measures were injured by tear gas grenades that, according to witnesses, used orderly forces.
The last nominees responded with stones, causing several police officers to get hurt.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and injured lawyers.
A few were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, attorneys of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced a demonstration, due to a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were overrun by roadblocks on Monday morning in order to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement gained the support of religious parties grouped in the politically strong alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "encouraged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the extraordinary state, and trash to those who took an oath before the Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise doesn't apply."
The Pakistani Supreme Court is a direct target of an extraordinary measure announced on Saturday night.
In the next few days, he was asked to comment on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf in the indirect presidential election that took place on 6 October.
The President of the Court Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
"All we witness is unlawful, unconstitutional, and against the judgments of the Supreme Court," said the official in The News.
Parviz Musharraf's promise to surrender the leadership of the army and become a civilian president, "not valid" after the introduction of a state of emergency, was announced by Tariq Azeem's Deputy Minister of Information on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform until November 15th, when his first presidential mandate ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Otherwise, the Pakistani government also refuted the ongoing speculation in the country, according to which the deputy chief of the army was to order President Musharraf to house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancy is still an unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as poorly planned or expected to occur in an unexpected way.
More than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is currently unexpected, reveals studies conducted by the French Institute of National d'études demographiques (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, 40 years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which allowed birth control in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as poorly planned or expected to occur in an unexpected way.
The various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilisation, still show a 5% to 6% rate of failure, estimated Ined.
After all, the law of contraception allowed a better "fertility check", claims the Institute and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years of age came from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten are now well planned.
One couple of five has even a birth calculated to a month accurately and, if possible, in the spring, which is considered the most enjoyable annual period for the birth of a child.
Recognisable repair of the Space Station
Over seven hours of space work, astronaut Scott Parazynski and the members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed a remarkable repair of the torn solar panel necessary for the further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky climb into space, which collected records for the duration, distance from the residential modules, the speed at which it was planned and the degree of "feeling" that astronauts had spent on repairing.
The trouble appeared on Tuesday, while the astronauts from Discovery ship unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install a European and Japanese science laboratory (see box).
This module is a kind of landing pier for modules-laboratory.
These, however, need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to relocate the 17-half-ton electricity-producing module using solar panels already located on the ISS so as to anchor at its final location.
After she moved it, the crew began to break down the seventy-six meter solar panels of the module.
And there was one of the panels that were decomposing as a pulling accordion, as a result of the clipping of the cable, damaged on an area of almost one metre.
Decomposition has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who had originally performed the control output on the Discovery ship, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, added to the arm of the station, and made a repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (space pedestrian) of the American Aviation and Space Office (NASA).
High, strong, very skillful, has a very well-designed chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was entrusted by a doctor to "operate" the "poisoned" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed some "dams" to the damaged places.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker", who remained close to the compensatory chamber, and also from the inside, the other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, namely a mini-hockey wrapped with an insulating agent, to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "in the Kutilsk" produced by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely disassembled and then inventoryed his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts had half a day’s rest before today, when seven astronauts returned to Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares weaken
The EADS shares are being lost on the Paris Stock Exchange, after this company operating in the aviation and defence industry has announced that it will have to spend EUR 1,2 to 1.4 billion to face the delays of the A400M aircraft.
EADS has lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21.96.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 as a result of delays resulting from the slow progress towards the development of the A400M engine, which is a prerequisite for the start-up flight.
The price for reducing delays in the delivery of military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was calculated "to EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus", announced the parent undertaking of the European EADS designer.
Due to these costs, the EADS, next Thursday, will be forced to report a new profit forecast before deduction of interest and taxes (EBIT).
The Group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
It is recalled that the production results of the EADS in 2006 fell by 86 % in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380.
Initially, the group assumed that the first delivery of the A400M aircraft to the French army would be provided by the French army in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without a strain of expectation: the Russians mostly choose the party of President Putin, the United Russia.
Confirming so, after the end of a very little free election campaign, its desire to stability, or to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimír Putin will communicate to the voters a pre-recorded television message, but its content is kept secret.
He acts as the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin Party, who apparently celebrates the overwhelming victory.
When he accepted the ambassador of foreign states yesterday, the president left nothing out of him and satisfied himself with the next attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite subject during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, and we wish for an honest, transparent and open choice, an election without a slightest flaw in beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's far from true.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
The Communist leader Gennadi Zjuganov says that "it has never been so dirty as Yulcine."
Following the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former world champion in chess, Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, continues to be banned according to his lawyer.
"The Russians remain the mentality of homo sovietica"
Two far more open questions are addressed in the background of these parliamentary elections of simple expectations:
- "Who's going to become Putin's successor to the presidential office?
The official letter was published yesterday on the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates may present to the public until 23 December.
Vladimír Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot pursue a third mandate in a row.
However, there is no followers.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be the Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful party of the United Russia, who chooses the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the entire line in parliamentary elections as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians remain the mentality of homo sovietica, they do not feel the master of their fate," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Sankt-Petérburg takes note of the distant context: civil society has taken on, in this country Christians five centuries after Europe, a delay; the famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s "Putin followed the paternalist model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, the fact that this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by economic prosperity", says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today "voluntaryly give up personal responsibility" which they have shortly proved after the collapse of the USSR.
"What to think about?"
This phenomenon concerns all social layers, including the commercial world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of the total of 85 heads of the Russian regions) run by local U.S. candidates.
The new freedoms taken from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990 ’ s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Nor will the Russians vote for extremists in the name of stability.
The conclusion of Tamara Czedředěnko, a 45-year-old professor: "What to think about?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, depicting the 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are opening to the public.
The 47 million archive documents stored in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were accessible only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and by name, at the request of the former victim or his authorised persons.
Eleven states responsible for the management of archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Given that the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to explore "especially the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-route, CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, were opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are supposed to be homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
Registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants assembled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for practical purposes to find deported or forced work submitted to civilians, to bring them proof of their internation in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen constitutes only a limited contribution.
"These documents cannot be expected anything substantially new", said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin Technische Universität in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
Today, bilateral trade between Europe and India is already close to €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of a free trade agreement in 2008, announced by the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers have given the European Commission a green light to launch negotiations to sign the free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian States (Asean). The bilateral trade between Europe and India is now almost €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India, according to the European Commission, is the EU's ninth trading partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement will greatly adapt both economies" and "India will gain better access to the 450 million prosperous Europeans market", said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, specified the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants together will change "EUR 47 billion in goods" and "EUR 10 billion in services" this week, said Danièle Smadja, Head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade 'has not yet reached its full potential'. The EU and India will meet at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi on Friday, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England took note of its concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the Bank of England pointed out that it intends to mitigate current concerns about the deterioration of credit market conditions and announced a bid of 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5.75 %, an offer that was exceptionally valid for a long time.
"In order to ease the concerns that the conditions on the financial markets will be very adverse at the end of the year and give banks greater certainty in the way in which to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during the maintenance period, which will start on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation", she announced in communication.
The Bank states that £10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will thus be placed on the financial market on December 6th at 12.15 GMT until January 10th at the basic interest rate.
It seems that this is the first time that BOE is pumping cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
It normally lasts a week.
BOE adds in its communication that "it remains ready to take further measures to maintain inter-day interest rates" inter-bank loans at the same level with its base rate.
The inter-bank interest rate was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been set at 6.6%, the highest figure since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to the fee rates that have deterred banks from using this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the development of the pound rate vis-à-vis the euro, many preferred to opt for the sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank at lower rates and guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populare, Union for the People's Movements) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) are refusing to address the Socialist proposals (PS) for the purchase of capacity
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss on Thursday the individual paragraphs of the socialist proposal for a purchase capacity law, which is equivalent to the rejection of the text.
On the agenda, the text of the draft law came under the so-called socialist " nest" (a meeting initiated by the individual Members' Club) and contained a number of measures taken on Tuesday by the PS Presidency, including an increase in the employment premium by 50 %, a renewal of fluctuating TIPPs, a transport check or rent regulation.
Given that the UMP and NC voted against the various paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the sitting was concluded after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more vivid, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before the television performance by Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchase of the ability.
The head of the PS Jean-Marc Ayrault has announced that his club will re-submit these proposals in their fullness in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finance Act that the House will discuss next week.
A New Festival Is Born
As a result of many speculations about the fact that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is setting up a new festival, this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in cooperation with the Festival of the Republic of Britain organizer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a man who has inspired the current festival movement in America without too much credit," said Charlie Jones of the C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camper's destination.
The festival should take place from 8th to 10th August at a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the lead at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
From 2002 onwards, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, is also in charge of production, licensing and organizational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which has a capacity of up to 177 500 people today.
Charlie Jones of C3 refers to Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he has ever experienced and says that his company and the company Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and along with Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in central Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were dealing with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the city's current leadership, we got caught up in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
" Luckily, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn, and we are about to set up a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 resurrected Lollapalooza festival in the Chicago Grant Park, after they were excellent on the festival scene by organizing Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to 9.8M$ and 11,3M$.
Both of these festivals are taking place in a city environment.
"The European model of the Melvin Benna festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals are taking place in green areas in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine in a certain way both concepts in order to create the impression of a rural festival in Europe and in the city after America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Occasionally, Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastic about supporting the implementation of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last appointed person refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, however, claims that "they are favourable enough to allow investment in such an event and to welcome the festival that will, hopefully, have a long duration".
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to that of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will accommodate 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is just being put in the press.
"Vineland will have a rock breath, but there will be a variety of music to attract as much audience as possible," says Carlie Jones.
The C3 partners who received the Top Independent Promotion Award in the last year of the Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself is against it...
This persuasion mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult for the Governor to fall into claws?
"It must be careful, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer one that they will consider to be the best," he said.
Hunting for festivals
For now, however, the priority is the promotion of local film by Denise Turcottea.
The Oscar hunt has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether they are festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting québecké films, alerting them and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had good publicity at the 30th year of the Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He'll be introduced to the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month also Québec presented four short and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
At the end of the year, on the marathon stock market, expertly divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and the investors are already expecting me to have a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will occur.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December has a positive course on the stock exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to produce forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in current context, markets offer, at least in the short term, certain doubts".
These experts do not assume that the stock exchange has been moving in recent weeks, stating that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives to guarantees, especially fixed income affected by the effect of turnover on quality securities, both in long and in short sections".
That is why they believe that the stock exchange will have rather a calm course, not without volatility, "mostly because the impact of the likely fall in the rates of the Fed (Federal Reserve) is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of incentives for inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of BPI’s sale in Spain, agrees that there is no time for a bold statement that a marathon will occur.
"There is not much reason for joy," assures this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15 945.7 points.
Yet all experts have no such negative opinion.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end a year a little closer to 16,000 points by regrouping portfolios and traditional deposits on pension insurance that occur at this time each year.
However, this expert suggests that everything will be a little different this year because he believes that the marathon will occur earlier, in the second week of December after the extended weekend on the occasion of the Day of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
At the same time, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "that is why we could observe the reflection of the index, caused by US reports on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree with the selection of titles to ensure that Ibex is brought to the new top.
Intermoney solo confirms that "this year's turn is on strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, 'because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive'.
Federico Olcha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that growth will go hand in hand with banking and industry.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this marathon if it occurs.
"ACS has been regaining its position for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will go the same way," explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to the increase in sales during the Christmas season.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technologies will also do very well, even though they are not very represented on the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of decline in two cases.
The actual marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003 in the administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis caused by the cracking of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28,17 %, December recorded an increase of 6,68 %.
We will see if 2007 will be the fifth year of profit (for the time being, Ibex has increased by 8.36 % since January) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of the bank Popular will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Banka Popular has decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of 200, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Similarly, for the other Spanish entities, as the first group to decide to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 8.30 p.m. and open on Saturday from 10 to 8.30 p.m.
The BBVA, another group, which has also ensured several times that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet been decided on this step.
In the meantime, he intends to conclude an agreement with the union to cancel the opening period of 75% of his branches on Saturday in exchange for extending the opening hours by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be decisive in joining or not other actors in this initiative, which supports the opening hours of the business.
That's exactly the goal of the project that popular bank has set out.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, tradesmen and shops from selected streets, where opening of branches will take place.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, not to open new branches, but only to modify existing ones.
Therefore, the bank will modernize branches that it already has in business zones by adapting the profile of clients in individual streets.
This is accompanied by another concept of branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in brighter colors.
The commercial director of Ángel Rivera assures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a greater recruitment of staff, as it passes from six employees to a branch of eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with premises for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Banka Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
The branches were selected in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía and according to River it seems to have been a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specializing in immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also has a very long opening hours and is open even on Sundays and on holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, when a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients,' says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telephonica to sell their phones through external personnel.
Telecinco, for the first time on the stock market, doubled the value of her rival Antena 3
We did it."
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the end of the trade, stating that the television he was running doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Only one thing was spoiling his joy: 'What I'm sorry about is that it didn't happen because we would grow more, but because we fell less', he said.
And he stressed that thanks to the weak market, 'we've fallen less'.
Telecinco terminated trading by 2.54 % yesterday.
This profit has shifted their loss over the past part of the year to 15.66 %.
The market value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with Vocento (more than 13%) is EUR 4 488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52 % yesterday and fell by 40,5 % overall from January, has half the value of 2 193,46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies evaluated amounts to 3.571 billion for Sogecable, 2,518,53 million Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antena 3 is offered because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do on the same market, at what price and how we evaluate it in ratings."
Telecinco announced last week that this year he is counting on overcoming billions of gross advertising revenues becoming the first television channel, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publicespaña, a branch that provides advertising to the group.
If the forecasted data had actually been achieved, this television channel would have seen a 3.6% increase in advertising turnover this year compared to 965,4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while the net revenues of the television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on is the increased pay out for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange, which has been maintained until now: in 2006 this company, which is chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, has divided 100 % of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that even if it is early for decision-making, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always reported much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already increased the value of 33% Endemol".
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue in these moments.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profitability estimates of Telecinco in 2008 4 % and 2009 7 %.
This is because they explain that the anticipated revenue growth has stopped from 0,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and from 5.5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
The same company reduced the estimated profit of Antena 3, i.e. 4,5 % in 2008 and 7.5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
One.
Ibersecurities: recommends purchasing both titles mainly on the basis of increased income for dividends and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: evaluates Telecinco (amount) better than Antena 3 (maintain) because of its 'many advantages' and growth in trade.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends not overestimating them because they face 'similar threats' (a saturated market and a degraded economic environment).
Congress approved the transposition of MiFID valid from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that were concluded today by the vote of the Congress on amendments incorporated by the Senate in the bill, the government subject the public hearing of the new law, with a view to both coming into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of individual parties have agreed to negotiate and agree on the best standard for the protection of investors and for the detailed regulation of the activities of the entities needed for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID, which is governed by the Securities Trading Act, foresees the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial consultancy services to be provided to both specialised companies, natural or legal persons, and create a new type of financial services companies (ESIS), financial consultancy companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities brokerage agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of operations with financial instruments is expanding by connecting to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and orders internalisation systems that will compete with current stockbrokers.
Furthermore, the law obliges investment service companies to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and ways of dealing with the risk, and requires that all operations carried out to simplify surveillance by the CNMV be reported.
During the negotiations in the Congress Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among which the outstanding ones, for securitised receivables to be considered as a "complex" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what occurred in the US with high risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally set out the functions that can be held by bachelors in the field of economics and business management for 30 years after the royal decree was approved in 1977, which sets out the professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work abroad, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide services for product trading and customer acquisition for different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4,1 % in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistical Institute) recalled that the information provided by this provisional indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be known on 14 December of that year.
"The ISC will continue to be relatively high"
The second Vice-President and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes stated that the November ISC increase to 4.1% was "temporary", but also predicted that the price index would continue to be relatively "high" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in Congress' machine guns specified that "even if it is not a positive figure", Spain's inflation differential towards monetary union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month when the government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected a value of about 4%," said the Minister of Economy on the data presented today.
Virginia plans to make EUR 42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Since North Rock was put into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At that time, the Bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually decreased in two and a half months by the distrust of clients even though the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virginia, which replaces the name of the entity with the Virgin Money brand, needs to earn around a quarter of the income entered into the British banks in the next three years, so that it can obtain the remaining 18 billion pounds and reach the target of 30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom for its significant advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about €70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
This week, Banka Northern Rock marked the offer of a Virginia consortium, which consists of three other companies, as the one that prefers to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
This morning, the Civil Guard seized the current mayor of the city of Totana (the People's Party) for his alleged involvement in corruption practices in the construction that were discovered this week.
In addition, one of the city hall's secretaries and the local police chief were arrested.
In May this year, José Martínez Andrea replaced Juan Morales, a contemporary Member of the People's Republic and until then the mayor of the village, who, according to the investigative sources addressed by the TVs Cadena SER, could have been the 'head' of the whole company.
The police continue to monitor the city hall and construction committee buildings and no further arrests are excluded in the next hours.
In addition, a lawyer named Juan Morales, the chief suspect in corruption practices in construction, was accused of being discovered at the beginning of this week.
As reported yesterday by Caden SER, a lawyer of 'humane' Member Juan Morales, who was examined, was arrested when he left Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to the investigative sources, Morales' alleged commission collection is the subject of an investigation for its signature of a construction agreement with a Galician construction company, which has been reclassified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently being arrested.
Bono accepted the offer to lead the Toledan candidate PSOE and, if they win, the President of Congress
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapater to stand in the next general elections at the head of the candidate list of PSOE (Spain Workers' Party) in Toledo and, if the Socialists win the general election, he became President of the Congress.
So, at the press conference, the Secretary of the PSOE for José Blanco and Bono, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place at the federal headquarters of the party this afternoon.
The executive chief justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems," that this La Mancha politician will be a candidate for the Socialist Party to the President of Congress if the Socialists win in the next election.
As President of Congress, Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who published his decision on 15 November not to run for general elections and leave his active political career in order to combat climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister had constantly urged him to return to the top policy he had left two years ago.
He further stated that, like the citizens, he knew who would be the Deputy Minister of Economy, if PSOE won the election, his party wanted to announce "transparently" who would chair Congress.
If Bono acquires this function, he hopes to transform the House into a "house of respect and not a swearing or a scream" and to achieve that "it will become more and more like a citizen".
"Unfortunately, the only place in Madrid where Congress is unable to speak peacefully and peacefully seems to have interrupted the Prime Minister of the Senate on one occasion 26 times."
Similarly, he expressed praise at the address of the current President Manuel Marín and his "good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place so far that he did not shrink to what his opponents might consider "greatness".
Climate propaganda
As the climate change movement undergoes unmerciful persecution both of those who sceptically view its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles, it must demonstrate strong cohesion.
Moreover, having a leader in the movement, which is Prime Minister as Zapatero, believes that this fight is more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why the activities or inaction of his government have contributed significantly to Spain’s failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors this is happening, and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
Moreover, this forces him to explain to the Spanish as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take in order to delay climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by which people's habits will have to change, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But that's not the kind of explanation we've been able to get, and we're not even going to see it.
It's because it's necessary to sacrifice and pay.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, proposed by PSOE (Spain Workers' Party), seemed so risky for Zapater in terms of elections that he hastened to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so it doesn't cost anything, pure propaganda, passwords that lack any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, committees, committees, protocols and new posts.
And the covenants with the planet; this gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that he doesn't even speak, he doesn't charge, he doesn't ask for anything, but he is the decoration of the parties and he raises them up.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contracting party and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool down with a fan.
Mayor and Chief of Local Police Totana detained for suspicion of corruption practices in construction
As informed by the investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "people" of José Martínez Andrea, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one enterprising businessman, for suspected crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his apartment and transferred to the town hall, where he is now located together with a number of police officers, who have also come to the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Lands and Flats.
These three arrests were added to the six that occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid in an operation involving the retraining of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on the ground suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last election period, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are charged in a short trial in the court of the first instance of the city of Totana.
The first six arrests were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales are being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of the real estate office, registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the Autonomous Region.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and entrepreneur from Viga, was arrested in Niger (Pontevedra Province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the group and despite which bribes were transferred.
The investigation is carried out by a group of criminal offences in the construction of an operational central unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrest, also carried out eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to the arrested, based in Madrid, Vig, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid province) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana, in the area of a very famous owner of poultry meat products, which could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was entrusted with the status of the largest residential complex in the city of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company gained 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was reclassified, and its project was to double the settlement of a municipality with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Fernando el Católico square in Vigo, Hogartel, dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.
It happens, too.
One.
If you don't mind, we'll leave the Book of the Month aside and maybe we'll be attacked in the meantime by other awards and competitions.
I've got something in my head.
Guys, life is a change.
Of course you can come up with ideas.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA's report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers printed on November 18, the same day that Critic of Blackburn's book appeared there by chance:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokela.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted in his notes the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, a councillor responsible for philosophy, demanded on the pages of Helsingin Sanomat that the professors take a critical position on Plato and claimed that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory primary course of high school philosophy."

One colleague informs of the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into a criminal code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime at a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you steal plates in the store at a price below EUR 400, this is considered a mere offense (§ 623.1).
B. If you alienate up to 1 000 euros in the store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for withdrawal (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to take part in a fight than a compact shift.
Participation in the riot has a rate from three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be the rate from six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than the download of a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected films is more punishable than the provision of pornographic materials to juveniles (§ 186).
So if my colleague's not wrong, someone's hand is holding, and that's good.

My doctor is pushing one of his articles on strange research called "money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings that make a month's pay for employees depend on how much colleagues make.
The research was carried out at Bonn University using magnetic resonances on the tomographer and the results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of the group Views of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The greatest activation occurred when the research participant reacted correctly and his colleague was mistakenly."
The researchers observed that if both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one got double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know whether this conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been ferociously persecuting criminals from the Balkan War for eight years from the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the chief culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladič and former leader of the Bosnia Serb Radovan Karadžič, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which the title of the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin list" (2006), not listed in Spain), which at the pace of the detective thriller, from Belgrade to New York, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in the pursuit of escaped criminals and pressure on the respective states to pull the net.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which protects drivers in the event of an accident, is a significant expenditure that depends on different factors such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
It is even more difficult to choose a suitable car insurance than to choose a car model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we're talking about.
The car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured person.
This obligation shall take the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking shall receive an agreed amount of insurance for taking charge of the payment of the damage in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance to be determined taking into account different factors such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle that is insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the higher the probability of a crash, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both those aged 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, insurance companies came to the conclusion that married persons have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the journey and thus the probability that it will have an accident.
The increase in driving frequency increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when determining the price of insurance.
The driver must therefore carefully examine the situation in order to choose the insurance best suited to his insurance profile.
We will show the most important variables for the choice of one or the same type of insurance, which, in addition to satisfying the type of insurer, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 face different disadvantages, such as little experience in driving and short possession of a driving licence when they want to make an insurance claim at an affordable price.
Although the insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are even cheaper variants.
The most careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks with an insurance discount in order to obtain insurance cover for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
"The part of the payment of the insurance event provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the premium price, which will be the higher the lower the participation", explains Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is the insurance extended to other participants in the operation by insuring the client against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under twenty-five years old, try to be considerate and avoid accidents as much as possible, since it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate of the insurance company.
On the other hand, Malus is an increase in that basic rate.
"The bonus and the malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus", explains Noguera.
After exceeding the limit of twenty-five years it makes it easier for drivers to order insurance, as the client's risk index decreases due to their experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks with a discount.
"Young people are not usually able to take advantage of the experience gained in advance at the time of the accident and even in driving," says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most of the accidents are taking place in the second year of the procedure, when the "fear of the newcomer" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not have children yet, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered as a clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (which could be EUR 300) or a high bonus, extended to other participants in the operation, starting from the third year following the purchase of the vehicle.
"Its management is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount", notes Luis Noguera.
Pensions are recommended insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (EUR 150) or insurance extended to other participants if a high bonus has been reached.
It should be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a good reason for proper study of the insurance options that would suit us most given our personal situation.
Celtic tries to get a point on AC Milan, which means eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to gain a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the league "Champions", as it would mean the first for Italy and for the Scots it would decide the location.
The Italians have ten points, and they have already secured the fifth draw in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but he needs one more to make sure that he doesn't have a six-point chess player who will play with Benfika, who has four.
These two group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round ends, since AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where the 13th in the semifinal will first enter, in an attempt to advance to the finale, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and the indecisive result at Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be the most likely, although both teams will try to fight for victory, because the Italians will not want to tact on home soil and Celtic knows that after winning would be the first and would secure a better place in the eight-finals.
The Gordon Strachan team could even be enough to make a move if the Chessman doesn't win, but he can't count on it, because at the same number of nine points the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1) but won in the first direct match (2:0).
And so the AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening to the Scots who believe they will get to the semifinals for the second time in the reorganized Champions League just like they were defeated in the same match in the previous competition by a Kaká goal in the extension (1:0) after the state of 0:0 in the basic playing time.
Hoping to win the "rossoneri" will be a chess player worth winning for only if Celtic loses, both for progress to the eight-finals and for survival in UEFA.
Benfica, although last and unable to continue in the highest European competition, could, by one win, reach third place, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert on the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls group launched its first tour in Vancouver (Canada) before 20,000 viewers since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Geri Halliwell" shortly before they started their concert at GM Place in Vancouver, declared that the reconnection of their group was "great".
About 20,000 people bought tickets so that they could be present for a concert, which also included a video depicting the history of this group, which sparked a sensation in the late 1990s.
Return and the world tour take place at the same time as the new album, which is released in Spain by EMI, brings a selection of their main success stories, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets that their husband gave them "Posh Spice", a British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned it a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what she thinks of the show."
"Sports Spice", whose exit from the group in 1998 "because of conflicts between us", caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also showed its nervousness in meeting journalists two hours before the start of the performance.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion changed, and the view of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought, "Why not, so I'm glad I made a decision," said Chisholm about the reconnection of the group she dissolved herself nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time "things settled and we all love each other very much".
But a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls last came out together in 1998.
In the beginning, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver with a special Virginia Airlines.
An army nanny was expecting them on arrival at the airport.
Five have a total of 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), in San José (4 December) and in Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
Madrid will perform on 23 December.
Concerns of a new fight over gas between Russia and Ukraine
There is currently a dispute between Russia and Ukraine about the price of natural gas, thus increasing the risk of the Russian supply of this fuel to Western Europe being affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is channelled through Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raised gas prices to Ukraine, it would charge Russia higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between these two last year has reduced deliveries to the EU.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says he will have to charge Ukraine more, because he agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas he receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it might mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its deliveries from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," said Reuters, Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoli Kinach.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a crushing decline in exports to Western Europe, which has greatly increased prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas supply in the world, but much of it remains under-used.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian Republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The auditor said that the NHS Scottish Chambers must improve controls on criminal records for non-European employees.
A recommendation from the president of Robert Black's Supreme Audit Office came after the foreign doctor in Scotland was connected to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the amount of foreign personnel he employs.
But his report stressed that the other key controls were in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in personnel from countries outside the European Economic Area immediately after the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Eighteen-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hit Jeep in the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of being involved in attempted bombings in the UK.
NHS Chambers are expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission is using Disclosure Scotland for the control of criminal records, the Agency has no authority to obtain such information outside of Britain.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office states, among other things, that the Commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau directives, which help employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we found that some of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not performed regularly," she announced.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS in many cases coincides with its own policy of pre-employee checks, but he also added: "Our report warns on areas where the system could be improved to ensure that precise information about the amount of foreign personnel is available."
President of BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry, said that it is "very unlikely" that pre-employee controls would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employee controls in the Scottish NHS work well and it is not clear what additional value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would probably also be higher because the Commission had a problem identifying personnel with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the established control procedures of NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently recasting NHS foreign personnel policy and pre-employee control directives.
Nicola Sturgeon, Minister of Health, said, "I wanted to do this job immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish Government, in accordance with the health committees, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that the best practices appear in the updated directives on pre-employee controls of all personnel - including those of abroad - which it is planning to issue next month.
Joy Division took over the film prizes
Control, a biographical film about the late singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five awards for the British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Film Award.
The awards were also won by the star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until Curtis' role, director Anton Corbijn and side-play Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench has been appointed the best actress for the thriller of the scandal.
And the candy star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting a British film on the world stage.
The prizes were presented solemnly at the Roundhouse in London.
Control describes Curtis' journey to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost only £3 million.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for his iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two prizes - for the best director and for the best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning - because the film by Julien Temple about the singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for the best documentary.
He won a cookie for the best actor Viggo Mortensen as the driver of the Russian mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg's Eastern promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of hard guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for his extraordinary contribution to the British film.
This fifty - year - old, such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another episode of Indiana Jones, the Kingdom of Crystal skull.
Winstone said he was proud of this award, which is named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened a door for people like me," he added.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great actor of my time, I'm very honored."
Independent film awards, known as the Buffs, are awarded by a jury in which filmmakers, actors and organizers of the festival meet.
The supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people because of a terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it arrested 208 militants for their membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil installations as well as on spiritual and security forces.
The state's largest oil exporter reported that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have been campaigning against the monarchy, the allies of the United States, since 2003, since the invasion of Iraq.
A TV report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on oil equipment in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia builds a rapid response unit with a force of 35,000 members to defend the equipment from the failed al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal statement: 18 arrested were among the cells led by "missile expert" that slipped into the country.
She also stated that the militants were planning to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to try harder to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join the al-Qaida militants fighting the allied forces and the Shiite government supported by the U.S., which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaida militants believe that the authorities have coopt many clergy in Saudi Arabia to support royal families who rule the government.
The militants - supported by the challenges of Al-Qaeda leader Sauda Osama bin Laden - focused on the pro-Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past five months," said the State Television spokesperson of the Ministry.
The 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested to promote "Takfirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which promotes violence against Muslims marked as unbelievers and apostates.
There were also 32 people arrested for providing financial support to militants.
The climate in Venus is perhaps a view of the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the current European station show that the planet is even more similar to the Earth’s twin head than it had previously been thought.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size and orbiting along similar roads, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that in Venus, billions of years ago, conditions were similar to those on Earth and could have been inhabited.
But the scared greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower speed of rotation sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today there is a planet without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and ravage it with storms and winds of hurricane power.
The findings of the European Space Agency Venus Express probe, which has studied the planet for one year, offer a moderate view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of Oxford University physics, and one of Venus Express’s leaders, said: “It’s becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data enables us to build a scenario in which Venus began as well as Earth, perhaps even with the surrounding environment, billions of years ago."
Police have arrested "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was arrested yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
Police spokesperson said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480 000 pounds).
Still open.
Mitt Romney said it's not worthy for the presidential candidates to answer the snowman's questions.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates then agreed to the YouTube debate in which ordinary voters recorded their video questions and handed them over for broadcasts to candidates.
None of the questions sent on Wednesday 28 November were as comical as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate of the other party on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected many about the state of the Republican Party towards elections next year.
It is unclear how exactly the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips that were then shown to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the strongest Republican themes.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn the disc when they heard something reassuring: the speaker recorded the peaks of consent when the candidates spoke of a hard approach at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who made a move forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr Romney, accusing the former Governor of the State of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his house.
These two fought particularly harshly when asked whether any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (give illegal immigrants a normal status and citizenship option).
Bystanders like Duncan Hunter, California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, Congressman of Colorado, managed to throw theirs a little bit on this subject.
None of these two have a chance to be nominated, but they both stay in the game, perhaps because they started beating on the alarm because of immigration sooner and harder than others.
At least immigrants have about the same opinion on immigration: greater rigour at borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with concerns about poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the contradiction between Libertins and Christian Conservatives.
But the debate became very uncomfortable when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether the technology of the simulation heater should be considered torture.
One questioner asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Through it, Mr. Giuliani stumbled to the conclusion that even though the Bible was his favorite book, he did not believe literally the stories of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now opposed to all the assumptions in a recent survey in Iowa due to his long-term Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, thereby earning a laugh.
The fight remains extremely open.
Mr Huckbee's rise in Iowa is in the recent successes in raising money and the loud cheer of Ron Paul in the Wednesday debate.
These two have bounced from the bottom because the two wings of the party still can't agree on more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with the winning news of the American size on the lips, winking at both sides.
This time the side is split and the result is far from unequivocal.
Labourist Pains
Gordon Brown again found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
There don't seem to be any sales of orders, no bills in the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been sucked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would have been without discovering that for four years, some wealthy businessman masked the contributions of the ruling Labour Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party did not announce it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided the election and insulted the British intelligence by claiming that this decision had not been influenced by surveys, there was hope that it would ensure a robust and effective government.
Instead of the increasingly funny representative Prime Minister of Liberal Democrats, once feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unscrupulous rescue of the problem bank Northern Rock has shown weaknesses in driving and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to change the tax code combined companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed unimaginable administrative failures.
The three generals in retirement started a riot in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending because they claimed that being the commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are numerous gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary General of Labourists (and their former internal discipline guard) has resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is going straight to his end.
Despite that, governments can reach a turning point where they find a heavy government.
The people don't trust politicians and don't like them, but they usually shift their distrust when a new group takes over.
When it seems clear that some prime minister is likely to improve anything and may not be long in office, this is a shift away: the state administration becomes a hole, the ministers start making briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government becomes unfocused and defensive.
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, because he cannot take the position of a new broom compared to other political leaders.
Whatever he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the Financial Office are linked to decisions made by Mr Brown as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in Blair's troubles, such as a long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "money responsibilities", voters may feel that he was.
Yet Mr. Brown's difficulties are not as bad as they look.
The excesses aren't as terrible as the conservatives make them.
As for Mr. Bean, no one has died or been deluded.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and lightly brutal government.
The latest excitement about political gifts is a good example.
The Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity, says he did not wish for any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr Watt, who said he knew about Mr Abrahams' progress, but did not know that he was illegal, would certainly be questioned thoroughly; as did Jon Mendlesohn, the chief Labourist money collector who learned about the tricky gifts in October.
But so far, Mr Brown is not involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these freckles, even though the main part of the payments took place only after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister's done half the work so far.
He quickly condemned this violation by his own party, but diluted his decision-making by reaching for a proven instrument, a committee to investigate this matter - led by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter of police concern.
In addition, there are also other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a standing chairman of an independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been with none for six months, and moving forward with a real reform of the financing of the political parties.
This would require the Labourists who are in close contact with the Conservatives and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with the Unions - bitter pills for a dedicated party like Mr. Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to beat the victory is by inconspicuous integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the underprivileged mortgage crisis affect the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, naturally, the spine fins begin to swirl.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is out of control, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that credit card losses, if subprime mortgages were to infect other consumer credit options, could reach $99 billion.
The voltage signs are clear.
The number of inability to pay (with more than 30 days delay in payment) and depreciated accounts (accounts that the provider considers to be non-enforceable) is increasing.
The HSBC bank announced last month that it lost $1.4 billion in the US consumer credit market - also due to insolvent credit card loans.
But it is still early to panic.
The write-off accounts and the inability to pay are still few.
According to the Moody's evaluation agency, 3.89% of the insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost a whole percentage point below the average.
Deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in the 2005 US personal bankruptcy laws has led to a sharp decrease in the number of reported bankruptcy losses that make a large part of the credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore increase regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers have deteriorated.
The sector also has a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay each month of their debts.
And trust in credit-carded securities is firm, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup research firm predicts that the volumes of their 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct pathways to spread infection between subprime mortgage crises and the credit card market certainly exist: when they dry up property loans, consumers are more indebted to credit cards.
However, credit card publishers are looking at cash flow rather than the value of the holding items, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of the lenders.
They can even be beneficial for loan providers.
The motivation of consumers to pay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards shifts up to the list of priorities to be repaid.
Card issuers can also react faster and more flexibly to turbulent conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of a rapid change in the price of hand objects.
"It's not going to happen that one beautiful morning we just re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of subprime mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more realistic.
If the lower house prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch the dorsal fins.
British bankers admitted guilty in the Enron case
The three British bankers, who were to be tried for their roles in the fraud connected with the former financial leader of Enron Andrew Fastow, changed their statements on Wednesday and admitted guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally guilty of seven fraud charges, when they and Fastow were to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- getting rich on the account of their employers -- denied.
They were supposed to stand trial in January.
However, during the trial in front of U.S. county judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been on the front page for two years, which has lasted in the tendering procedure.
In the United States, their case is one of the unopened parts of an investigation initiated after the Enron crash in 2001.
The accusations against them in 2002 warned Mr Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the collapse of Enron.
The prosecution against bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Triangle" -- claims to have come to Houston in 2000 to design fraud together with Fastow and his former chief associate Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a partner branch of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was an architect of a lot of enronian fraud, which pushed Enron after a spiral towards a bankruptcy announcement.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its share in this branch zero, but our three British knew that it was of great value.
The company under Kopper's control bought a share of the bank in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminating bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for this company's share.
According to the prosecution, Fastow deceived Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its share in this Greenwich NatWest branch.
But the 20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers, according to the indictment, received 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others increased by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted guilt in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
The copier is in prison for three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
All three of the British were free to bail out $1 million that ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks had no longer been able to hide billions of debts or show failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has abolished thousands of jobs, over $60 billion of market value and over $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief worker Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the collapse of society.
Skilling is serving more than twenty-four years.
Judgments over Laye for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow Non-Solidarity
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel for nonstop years from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
Of course, for some of the Russian rich, these are small to return.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, deputy of Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer was sitting at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire's Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of spectacular consumption in mammoth's exhibition center on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers built their stalls, hoping that the newly-rich Russians would lure everything from the mahogany unloaded yachts to diamonds decorated with bulkheads to cars for which not even 50 Cents would be ashamed.
Mr. Firer carefully looked after the bright orange Porsche in the next stand.
"That's a nice car, but it's dimes and dimes against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is Russia's second largest private aircraft market."
On the waves of oil, money goes to the Russian capital as when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans got hugely rich and went to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a listener of the fourth year at Davis' centre of Russian and Euro-Asian studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi boomers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians become the most prominent of the world's spending.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their piece on this Klondik.
At a different location in Moscow this week, the conference of the luxury industry of Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of the LVMH Group, attracted the conference on how to sell expensive goods on markets such as the Russian one.
(The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has a list of the richest people of Forbes magazine of 53 billionaires with a total fortune of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the local Central Institute in the Center for Economic and Financial Research published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 "second-rate" millionaires in Russia whose assets total amount to $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the existing minima limit.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London jewelry store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly modified and men are every man's fortune."
As they walked in the evening dresses on Sunday evenings through the halls, 21 - year - old Evgenia Yumatova and five - year - old Světlana Turovecova called themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatov, who put herself in designer clothing like a veteran of red carpets, next door to which Joan Rivers looks like a house-maid.
The fair seemed to focus mainly on the fresh rich, brand-controlled Russian buyers who are willing to sit out for several hours in the road traffic so that they can walk through the warehouses that screechingly mix Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fishes, Mövennick ice cream, billiards custom-made, Dubai suites, Gund stuffers and draughts.
Members of a simple public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft before reproduction of Rembrandt's painting from hand-painted blue tiles of overlife size.
"Of course, the Russians care more about the gold."
And indeed, local vendors say that the Russians with old money (by Russian standards is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from the shiny log to the little-known markers of limited editions that would never show up at the shopping fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local bed manager for King Koil, said he sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, intertwined with gold threads, after $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, said that his company sold a clear orange Porsche for $170 000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, introduced luxury cars on request that he sold three bars to cars in the style of chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000.
He showed the reporter the car wheel designed for the Russian casino owner, which had the cover of the Swarov crystals so that it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich-skin bikes or portraits of his wife from cubic zirconia doesn't have to ride those bikes yet," said Mr.
"He's going to store them in his garage by 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean anything very exclusive at present, given the large increase in the prices of local properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already millionaires, at least on paper, when not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at the stand operated by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company raised four red phone booths of the British style stuffed with a column of counterfeit bills worth $1 million.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit bills for the Millionaires' Fair.
The detours stopped to throw money around, or to let their friends take a picture with a mobile phone, resting in the middle of a replacement wealth, or just stuff a pocket of a few million.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may have been caused by a corrupt operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the restaurant a little healthier and watched an ambulance arrive at the white New English house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
Soon, a patrol car joined.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the delivery of a medical examiner arrive," said Mr Livingston, the restaurant controller.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that a dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41 years old, an executive assistant to the head of Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Ms. Arroy's death, and they hope that the toxicology tests that may not be known for weeks will help solve the mysterious death that sent out a wave of sadness by leading the NYPD.
Ms. Arroy was the assistant police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious and hardworking," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr McCarthy said that Ms. Arroy was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former NYPD officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, leaving behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson of the U.S. Attorney General, Theodore J. Romankov, said the detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroy died of an unlicensed surgical operation.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at approximately three o'clock in the afternoon.
November and found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead on the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, reportedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't tell me if Miss Castro's authorities heard from her.
The investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as an office.
In the middle of Miss Castro's house, with a damaged pink bush in the front yard and a dalmatin barking in the back, no one answered
Next to the door that led to the basement, he throneed in an open garage blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillon" - which is a substance used as a substitute vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes were hanging on one side of the hooks.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York City Police Department after 25 years, Ms. Arroy provided him with invaluable help in biting through the hateful and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful with this or this,' he said.
"She was here every time I came, and she was here every time I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the Fed will lower interest rates leads to a stronger global stock market
The stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market hope that the Federal Bank would try to calm down the lending conditions by further reducing interest rates were strengthened by the reassuring statements of the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The storms jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in a row behind Ben Bernank, the head of the Fed, said that in response to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets, the managers must be "flexible and pragmatic".
As part of an obvious effort to calm down the irritable markets in the middle of signs of resurrecting credit effort, Mr Kohn said that recent riots "partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of markets by the end of September and October".
He further stated that if the increased instability persists, the possibility of further deterioration of the financial conditions of households and companies will be increased.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that the Fed is prepared to deliver additional fresh capital to the US markets, and perhaps further reductions in interest rates in order to stabilise credit conditions.
These comments also helped to calm Wall Street down in the middle of other bad news about the American economy when sales of flats in October showed record low numbers.
The effects of the financial faith were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns that it would cancel 650 jobs, 4% of its world workforce, in the context of cost reduction due to the severe losses caused by the failed bet on the provision of sub-prime housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these sites are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial index of Dow Jones grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13 289.40, while the more used index of S&P 500 strengthened by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6,306,2 with the value of the British blue-chips increasing by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions on the markets showed full strength after the European Central Bank's three-month cash packages were loaned to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, most since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release above-standard money into London's money markets increased, with the rate of three months of British interbank loans "Libor" rising after uninterrupted growth from 12 November to the maximum since the end of September - 6.59 percent.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as heavy as the other.
Who's gonna be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who holds on to this post at best in time borrowed, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision-making help, and since Hugh Morris, the chief manager of the English team, is starting to fill in applications for the national collector's post, though not necessarily full-time.
Whoever is not built in sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and not sport at all.
It is not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else will never get past the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of happiness rather than ability.
Not only in cricket is selection demanding and requires assessment, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if it is?
We could also ask the same question in other areas, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banjee, both smart young leaders with good education and an overview in the field, should be promoted to the committee - a place for just one.
Who's to say what level is right for crickets if he can't get a chance to drop or swim on the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a great influence on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
On the team, the cricketman must catch the captain's sight at the right time, if he's to take a Wicket, and the batter needs regular chances at starting positions, if he's ever gonna make an impression like a day-old cricketer.
It's more complicated to pick up the picker's point of view.
For example, last season was much better than James Anderson, whose place in the first test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as an artillery.
Anderson took 32 Wickets in first class at 33 runs on everyone.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same modest average, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hoped for the next.
If he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can be just a matter of opinion.
The choice can run or finish the career of both, or also may not have a great influence.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test, and in the first class served good performances, five Wicket and 40 holiday runs, but he was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketer, who is also, although in Australia he scored twice a hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one further discussion following today's training purely at Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's more experience than Bopar's youthful lushness.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkly and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in first class compared to six Bopar, which is, at the age of twenty-two, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
However Shah made in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Test on Lord's, his home field in Middlesex, just ten runs, together with the immediate rejection of the collectors when Vaughan wanted to capture him again for the next game, his firing seems to have taken off something from the elite that was in Mumbai so obvious.
In contrast, the Essex universe has a joie de vivre in its bones.
He's not scared of anything on the cricket field, and his behavior outside the field symbolizes a recently-turned car with four-wheel drive on the exhibition day of the automotive sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He got off with minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he pulled was his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his fellow player who watched it from a distance, to ask him arousedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, with its medium-speed slide pitches on the local playgrounds that seem to suit him, giving away effectively and firing confidently and skillfully.
It's one thing to choose the right person, to choose the right time is another.
Maybe it's the real art of choice.
Personally, I am inclined to give Bopara a chance now, which I do not want to say that Shah will not excel if, as the cilon tea tickets suggest, he will be the one playing here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria yesterday began to arrive in Baghdad and pour out refugees who ran out of money or expired visas, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even came back to fight the armed men who drove them out of their homes.
Mansurian bus station was before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convoy about a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned on private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaisi, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read about in the paper about because of what happened in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, having in mind the Shiite militia of the militant spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the mostly Sunni region of Amaría, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew the Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow the Iraqis to work there.
His Shiite neighbors in Amarii called him to say that the local Home Office with the support of the U.S. military helped to push al-Qaida out of her positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was banished from his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"The day before yesterday, several friends called and told me that they were starting a militia against al-Qaeda in Sleikhu and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said the 60-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many talked about the attraction of calming in the capital after strengthening the American military presence and the growth of local "group of prejudiced citizens", which defends their quarter with weapons in the arms of the U.S. military.
But more talked about the fact that they were forced to return by obstructions around visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a fifty-year-old father of three children, voiced suspicions shared among refugees that Núri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visa of refugees and thus forced them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people escaped from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq," said the Sunni retired.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the weakening of violence is that the Sunnis were pushed out of the Shiite regions and vice versa, which in many places reduces tension.
There are concerns that the sudden influx of refugees is reinvigorating sectarian tensions and leading to a further struggle.
Small Sarah, good education
Germany’s smallest federal country plays a leading role in vocational education, and even excels at the international focus of its universities.
In only one educational area, Sarah is concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"A man who does not come from Sarah yesterday, I explained yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan in Sarah appears on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal country.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in monitoring the education of the Kolín Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place in the Sarah educational system.
Colleges have traditionally worked closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a reasonably high share of foreign students, which amounts to 15.6%.
After all, an above average number of Sarah's children are admitted to college - many of them, even without a high school.
"The professional education system is being used in Sarah," says Axel Plünnecke, IW educational expert.
More than five youths are authorised to study at a vocational school, Sarah is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich possibilities in Sarah to combine practical and academic education.
The possibility of studying two fields is the second best in Germany with regard to the population.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of graduates in engineering has fallen by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering.
"After the first study of Pisa, we carried out several reforms at general education schools," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to learn as soon as possible, the last year of maternity school is free - a model that takes over other federal countries.
If the results of the pupils improve significantly, future comparative studies will show up.
In the implementation of the Pisa study in 2003, the proportion of risk pupils decreased from 29% to 20%.
However, Sarah did not improve as much as other Lands.
Bavarians can count better.
And to disappoint Sarah, Pisa's studies do not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise Sarah could score in this area.
The language of neighbors is mandatory in high schools - although the inhabitants of Sarah are not French.
Chávez moves the clock
The clocks in Venezuela go differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will have the hours shifted back in this South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, in the meantime, Chávez becomes a ridiculous figure.
According to the New Testament against World Time, Venezuela’s official letter reported that the clocks would be reduced by a minus four and a half hours.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chávez, the US enemy, justified his decision, among other things, by forcing the United States to divide time zones throughout the hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday, that he was interrupting relations with neighboring Colombia because of the case with hostages.
This left-wing nationalist said that as long as he was the conservative Alvaro Uribe president of Colombia, he would not have any relations with either the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this because of my self-esteem," said Chávez, who is promoting the reform of the constitution on which the citizens of this oil country must vote in the Sunday referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
Uribe's decision to take away Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with the Marxist rebels to release the hostages.
Uribe, by his decision, spit in the face of Venezuela, criticized Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone has triggered a stir: "Por quono te callas" (Why aren't you quiet?) - that's the phrase that has already been downloaded from the Internet by more than half a million people.
It was spoken by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at the recent Ibero-American summit, was so upset by the loud remarks of this leftist populist that he silenced him in this way.
Germany is facing a lower paycheck in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are at risk of real wage reductions despite a strong downturn this year.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, employed people can actually expect lower wages in 2007 than in last year.
"The blame is borne by a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy," said Bild Gustav Horn from the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Macroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
A new burden on employees may also be waiting in the area of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that for the new year the planned reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency would no longer be allowed to fall into such difficulties as to require loans or contributions from the Federal Youth, quoted by the newspapers of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was published that the price explosion of food and petroleum products has driven inflation to its highest level over the past 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3 % in the year-on-year comparison.
Venus is a hell of a twin Earth
Throughout her life, the enemy atmosphere is more similar to Venus Earth than was previously assumed. The European Space Probe Venus Express on Venus has seen phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and winds on the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have known that Venus is flashing.
Now the Venus Express European probe brought proof - it caught electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at an altitude of approximately 56 kilometers, wrote in the science magazine Nature Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to the known theory of the formation of the primary matter on Earth, life could have been created by lightnings. The storms allegedly caused reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the fundamental stones of life.
It was not so in Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"Venus may be a hell of a twin Earth, but he is a twin," said Russel.
Why Venus, which is so much like the Earth's matter and size, began to develop completely differently, is the fundamental issue of the mission of Esa.
Since no probe has been sent since the early 1990s exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in the research of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which brought together several articles of the magazine Nature, did not stress only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more similar to the Earth than it was previously assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known winds on the North Pole, scientists found a vortex in the South Pole, which spins much faster.
This phenomenon resembles the air currents on the northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Instituto di Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system is almost the same as the Earth, and with an average of 12,100 km, it is almost the same size.
This planet, called Jitranka or Evening Lady, will orbit the sun in almost 225 days.
One day, on Venus, it takes 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble the surface temperature of 460 °C and pressure of 92 bar Earth, scientists are based on the fact that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
But on Earth it remained in the oceans, while on Venus it disappeared into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonate on Earth, in Venus, it forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's encounter with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands the termination of party disputes for the admission of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellor's Office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and calls on the Great Coalition to end the dispute around the admission of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not, on the outside, present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler said to the economic newspapers Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights are universal to me," said Köhler.
Although the Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not prevent the Merkels from defending themselves when they were accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not abandon the traditional politics of the United China.
China also knows," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disagreement with the admission of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained about, among other things, the "presiding" foreign politics of the coalition.
Following the admission of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellorial Office, German-China relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but it also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of foreign ministers of both countries, according to SPIEgel magazine.
The Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jibao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that accepting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jibao stressed China's position.
Words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions that are also in China, is attempting to separate itself from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrests in France
Street fights with police, gunfights, burnt-out cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar riots that broke out in France.
We must do everything possible to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow in violence on the street, and calls on the Federal Minister of the Interior.
The barricades were on fire, the rioters fired shotguns at the police. After serious youth riots in France, the Federal Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful not to create such social tensions as will break out in violence.
We have to take this seriously," said Neue Presse in Hanover.
Not every young person is able to cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The Federal Government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to eliminate the problems, said Schäuble.
Which does not mean just the integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we have recorded our first success."
But caution is still in place.
At the same time Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs were not comparable to those of France.
In recent nights, youths and police in the northern suburbs of Paris have been doing hard street fighting.
Even in Toulouse, there were cars and public buildings burning.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were requested by the President of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imilar effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should still be done.
The Colate pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the rate of unemployment is "averagely high".
In particular, more study opportunities must be provided.
The wheel stressed: "We must give youthful hope."
However, the head of the Turkish municipality added that, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Moreover, many youths from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
The wheel urged, "But we must be careful."
We need to allow juveniles to start working and getting educated quickly.
Meanwhile, the night remained in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel mostly calm.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorised authorities reported three arrests and several burnt-out trash cans and cars.
Since yesterday, around 1,000 order forces have been deployed.
The police will intervene as long as necessary after a visit to the suburbs of the Home Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In riots in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, the riots of Toulouse took over.
A car accident caused the accident of Sunday, in which two youths lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the U.S. Attorney's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of juveniles.
In Angela's "Cloud" realm
The Chancellor's remote output documents that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we cannot expect anything more from it alone.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her inconvenient, indifferently sounding and content poor speech at the general debate of the Federal Parliament, we must say: not here - not in this country, which she should, after all, manage.
The regret that she was focusing too much on foreign policy was answered by Angela Merkel once with a very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, which shows that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are up to.
She visibly showed everyone in the Federal Assembly how much she deserved that regret.
Merkel wasn't even really interested, let alone a feeling for problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Cloud" presented herself: a politician who excels over others who flee into foreign politics and also expresses only nebulously.
For example, climate protection: it praises itself without ceasing the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
By the way, such self-praise - so much indiscriminateness would have been forgiven by the CDU president two years ago.
She is now limited to false phrases that could increase her popularity amongst people.
With this approach, it damages its pragmatists, who do not need flattery, because they solve problems.
But in Angela's "Cloud" realm, internal political problems are marginal issues.
Child poverty and concern for low-wage people?
She's got a few side sentences on these issues.
It's worth noting how often Merkels talk when it comes to child support.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning in order to manage to make at least a partial statement.
As soon as things get too specific, they stumble like a total stranger.
Assault Division
In the case of the favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, the debate of Republican presidential candidates for Youtube has set off in a lot of debate - and they must now both be afraid of an outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already shown on the first topic.
Mitt Romney is throwing at his opponent Rudy Guiliani that he made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani responds quickly with sharp remorse: "I believe his own house was just one such refuge," he answers and tells former governor Massachusetts that he privately employed immigrants without any documents.
As the Republican base does not yet have a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates at CNN to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, Internet-based users and via Youtube, the videos sent only serve as such clues to the key topic.
"We have enabled Hitler to seize power with this very policy of isolationism," John McCain throws his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one who advocates the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
The Vietnamese veteran McCain does not spare Romney with his remorse for refusing to condemn a torture method called "Waterboarding" in which the heating is simulated.
The reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are important topics of the campaign.
The audience will burst in applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
That's where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains confoundedly and asks a party base and television audience to forgive him for having been a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
The Musharraf first reigns in a civilian
A day after his resignation from the position of Chief Army Commander, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf took a presidential oath.
This ends in eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's president, Parvíz Musharraf, took a presidential oath on Thursday, and it remains in the presidential office for the next five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
The Musharraf swore to honor the constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office as Chief Military Commander to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, making him subject to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup, the former general ruled for the first time as the civilian head of state.
By resigning from the position of Chief Commander of Armed Forces, Musharraf met one of the main requirements of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional state declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to the Chief U.S. Attorney, Malik Muhammad Qayyum will cancel Musharraf's state of emergency soon after his oath, thus fulfilling other Western requirements.
The Supreme Court of the country, which, following the announcement of the emergency at the beginning of November, occupied him with inclined lawyers, rejected all objections to the disputed re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the attack on a military convoy in the North Waziristan tribal area, and four others were injured.
The spokesman of the army said that the bomb exploded on the road near the Afghanistan border.
Father's Crautock Returns
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia Group took over again at the concert in Berlin with their electronic synthesizers.
The Revival will also include Live 1974, cut from the most successful period of the band.
They were already far more famous abroad.
The announced sensation lies in the performance of the three settlers, who at first look like they were enjoying dinner.
Everyone's got boxes, cables, and buttons in front of them.
Thirty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sitting in the middle.
On his left, there's a 70-year-old Michael Roth who's got a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Three-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who concentrates on synthesizers, is from the perspective of viewers on the right.
Everyone makes noises, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by a failure, they form a traditional composition.
Seems like it doesn't bother the masters of the musicians.
Among the lovers of Krautrock, the band Harmonia was reviving a lot of excitement.
One thing is worth noticing. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of a collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not enough to have a painful lack of this band for twenty-three years.
But why couldn't a German celebrate his still living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when you're in a musical style, the mistakenly called Krautrock, in England and America, they value more than in their own country.
In 2003, when the music business granted the Can Echo Prize to the remaining members of the cologne group for life, the hall was full of questionable views of German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! for their speech, they no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Roth later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers, he sat with them on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and idolatry abroad is one thing.
By remembering Harmonia, we overestimate memory, this trio existed for just two years, and at that time it did not have the same influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius have played with an artist named Conrad Schnitzler before under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the basement of the Berlin theatre Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for a phonograph company run by the churches.
Roth briefly helped with the group Kraftwerk, but he won a reputation as a guitarist with the band Neu!, which at the time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, Roth followed the musicians of Cluster to exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, the ruins of the 16th century, lived as members of the commune who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius could still trot as a nanny.
It was more of a life in such a Spitwegian artistic being.
The name for the given art is reportedly derived from the name of Harmonia Ottenstein's choir, whose badge was allegedly found in the trash can.
Many of this has been preserved by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music by Harmonie" and the following was called "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Collecting plants wasn't just about getting to know each other.
Now released by the CD "Live 1974" was said to have been cut from a record small, barely 50-member scene during the concert in Griessem.
That time, Rother expressed his wish that the members of Harmonia would hang out and exercise on occasion.
For Roedlio and Moebia, it was a completely rude request.
In 1975, the band announced its breakup.
Roth ended up in the esoteric realm, and his future was insured with the album "Smoking Heart".
Cluster's band came to life again in the '80s, and since then, it's been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griesemer.
His recording company Grönland took the aim of Krautrock to look after as an original German contribution to live music.
The Neu! Band was then considered Roedeli's solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
The present will be Brit, Julian Cope, the old punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also participate.
So we drew the overall range of the impact of Krautrock on future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group will fill Harmonia.
Brian En's message, accompanied by the most extraordinary sounds in the hall, is: "The unique true music, it belongs to the future."
There are paintings in which the producer and Harmonia are in the agricultural seat.
The creation of the legend also contributes to the screening of other black and white photographs on which a set of devices are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are once again employed by improvisation.
Not by sticking microphones to the organ and drums, so that they can come out of the tools that have never been heard of self-made tones.
Electronic music looks like electronic music today.
Three in the troublemaker technique.
There is no change in the congregation of the House of World Cultures.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds and sings emphatically "Aaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find roots rather than in blues at music universities (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in flight from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever in this place shouts "'68!", is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia is not going to let herself get out of peace now.
Even the most obvious is carefully considered on the stage.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This question of man either loses his nerve or allows him to experience passing moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
With the introduction of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, there were two films about the Balkans War.
But neither of them is convincing.
The model films either place too much emphasis on action and shooting, or are too touching.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere can stop him at The Hunting Party.
The good news is first: the war criminals Karadzi and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the gloomy background of the Bosen War, actor Richard Gere will appear.
We have recently lost sight of this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he has played many lovely, unspeakable roles in cool women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences on Buddhism forever, people will want another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become a prey (Why must the names of the films be so long and confusing these days?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically who Gere could have become if the fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has his best years behind him, but still retains a remarkable charm as a ruin like the monument.
But despite this trump, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the cinemas this week, is just a continuation of the endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who saves a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, and one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is laudable that the Serbs are not introduced as the cause of all evil, this TV film is changing too soon in shooting and action.
There's going to be something very similar from the film called the Cobra 11 series, without the freeway, but with the war.
The film The Hunting Party can be clearly examined why the Balkan War has not been able to make a really good film.
The story of three American war reporters who pretend to be a " fox", a Serbian top war criminal, would perhaps become a new "Apocalypse" at a different time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (here both Richard Shepard).
For both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is not capable of, but their way becomes the way to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the depraved and sentimental cynic presented at the beginning.
On the contrary, he will also be prescribed a romantic affair with a later-murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The film The Hunting Party can be finally depreciated after what NATO, the CIA, and all the world's criminals have failed in the last five years: to catch criminals and to leave him with just revenge against the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court of the Hague.
This film has a deep human message.
It condemns the fact that Karadzi and Mladić are still at large, and suspicions of Americans and French (they are exceptionally united here) that they do not commit themselves sufficiently intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But the good and the evil are so similar sometimes, the women come to our minds the famous poem of Brecht.
In it it is a wooden mask of the Asian demon on the writer's work desk: "With compassion I look at the onslaught veins on the forehead, noting: how hard it is to be evil."
In movies such as The Hunting Party, they perform exactly the kind of sudden heads that suggest how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited only to the subject of the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it was written in these newspapers that all Hollywood films about Iraq were major failures.
One thing to add: No good film about South Africa has ever been made before.
Almost always applies: When a star wanders through a crisis area or walks through a minefield, a film like Rangoon and Patricia Arquette, a break-up border with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprio will be created.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, they had to go decades before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's list.
Many films seem to have to mature - films that are now considered to be classic works of Vietnamese - "The deer hunter", "Apocalypse" or "The lead vest" - were in no case celebrated as masterpieces at that time.
But maybe today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Writers have no ability to tell good stories without fault.
"Being or not being" or "Big dictator" became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know in a terrible way how the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to create a sarcastically measured artistic view as Lawrence Norfolk's novelist.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and "Balkan War", he said: "The likeness is only that some things never change.
The big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps criticism for renouncing the Olympics
The resignation of the mayor from the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg has come upon a violent criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to fight further for the organisation of games by the water.
But Von Beust encourages realism in the estimate of chances.
The head of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described this decision 'in terms of business as unfortunate' on Wednesday.
No other project has been as motivated in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sportingly political enthusiasm to such an extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but he created a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed at the center of his earlier statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are unrealistic at least until 2028.
"No, Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on the Olympic candidacy", said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that, at the beginning of December, the Sports Union will decide on the candidate for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich.
"This preference to us means that we have no realistic chance with a time plan of 2028."
Yet this dream is not over, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) called von Beust’s statements regrettable.
It seems that Hamburg does not want to apply to the organisation of the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to destroy our chances by calling our plans buried in this early phase," said President HSB, Günter Ploss.
The waiver would be contrary to the statement by the head of the Senate at the general meeting of the General German Higher Education Union.
Von Beust did not announce the Hamburg candidacy at the University in 2015 as a substitute for the organisation of the Olympic Games.
Only in the last week did the Hamburg University Sports Union nominee for a candidate city.
The faction of the SPD in the Hamburg Senate pointed out that it was wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of Klein Grassbrook was braked by the Senate for years because he bet on organizing the Olympics and excluding the construction of apartments," said SPD Members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While SPD for Klein Grasbrook was still planning the Olympics, with the fact that the whole area will later be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic Factor".
Negotiations for the 2012 Olympic Summer Games sparked great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
But Hamburg crashed in Leipzig.
Those aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever combines the terms Sweden and wooden boxes is not thinking about Andy Warhol, but about Ikea.
Is it?
The wooden crates currently produced in Sweden are dumping dark shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of his list of ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" in Stockholm are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo Boxes" of 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm comes with the result of disillusionment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 donated the Museum of Moderna Museet to his former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - like most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type, which are in circulation on the international art market.
Previous events are a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes that were based on the red-blue design of the Brillo soap boxes.
The exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from Brillo factory.
It wasn't the works of art, it was their designs, just the pieces of art.
Warhol apparently gave a permit in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo boxes in Sweden, but they are not exposed in Moderna Museet.
The then witnesses now speak of fifteen crates, which were rightfully entered into the art and auction history as originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 approximately a hundred crates were produced and displayed in Sweden, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmo for the exhibition in St Petersburg only in 1990.
By then, Warhol had been dead three years.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museet, examined, in addition to six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and, after being painted with basic paint and trimmed, were painted with a brush with oil white.
On the other hand, the structure of the copies from 1990 revealed that the paint was applied directly to the plywood plate without the previous basic paint - in addition, it is an acrylic and not an oil paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo boxing list," Lars Nittve heard: "If Andy Warhol Art Authorization Board in New York does not conclude otherwise, Moderna Museet will have to classify six crates from his exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies".
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these "key charges" that were filed in the case of soap powder boxes.
However, the organization still remains in unrelenting silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had been established in a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The insurgent commander Antonio Trillanes, who was extorting the president of manipulation and corruption in the election, told the hotel reporters that he refused to be held responsible for the bloodshed.
Soldiers dedicated to the government had previously attacked with tear gas on the hotel.
A few hours before that, about two dozen soldiers were fortified in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were in court due to a failed coup attempt in 2003, including the Trillanes.
He took advantage of the negotiations to flee with his about 30 sympathizers.
The military officers who were supposed to be guarding him apparently ran over to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and requested the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government's loyal units have closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president has called an emergency session of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the act of soldiers.
"People have had enough," said Triallnes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite unit Scout Rangers, said that in a short time, other troops will join the march.
Government critics called for a major demonstration to take place against the president on Friday.
For months now, her government has been accused of corruption.
In 2003, the Manil financial region became the main scene of the rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroy.
Because the rebels were refused to join the army, the rebellion broke down after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, the Philippines has tried to overthrow a democratically elected government at least seven times.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatel
The United Internet has secured more than 20% of its share in the Versatel telecommunications company.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share was EUR 14,46.
They say that the company now owns 20,05 % of the share capital.
Before that, they were speculating about taking over.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its share in Versatel.
United Internet announced that by this step it was trying to speed up the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its share of this Düsseldorf network operator by an additional 5 % to 15,1 %, the input assumptions appeared on Wednesday.
The financial market is said to hold shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, the United Internet at Drillisch, a provider of mobile telecommunications networks, had almost a 10% stake.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch gave EUR 106.4 million of new shares worth EUR 17.4 million to sell.
Of these 5.15 million shares he bought the United Internet for EUR 31.4 million.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the area of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," explained the spokesperson of the United Internet.
In order to take over the competitive company Freenet, the companies together established a joint venture of SMEs.
On Thursday, the United Internet announced that both companies will, for the time being, be satisfied with a share of more than 10 % and will not exercise their right to take over another 18.49 % of the company.
It is considered that companies are keeping all options open so far, especially the possibility to further increase their share in Freenet AG.
The discussions between the United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were completed in mid-November.
This long-lasting and difficult-to-transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had a mobile network of 2.9 million contractual customers at the end of the third quarter and 1.27 million customers with a complete or DSL connection.
Holding United Internet and Drillische still held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
Now it was agreed that Drillisch would receive approximately another 4%.
The right to buy 18,49 % of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
