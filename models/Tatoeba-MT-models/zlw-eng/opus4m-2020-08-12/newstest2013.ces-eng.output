The Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policy of the necessity of fighting electoral fraud.
Brennan's centre, however, calls such a myth that electoral fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who will die after lightning intervention.
In fact, in the last ten years, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the USA.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, they are responsible for the organisation of federal elections by individual states in the US.
And in this spirit, the majority of US governments have been declaring new laws since 2009 that make the election process difficult or more difficult.
This phenomenon has seen a boom after the November 2010 elections, with 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries.
As a result, for 2011 alone, 180 proposals were submitted to the Act restricting electoral law in 41 countries.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws restrict the periods for elections in advance, invalidate the right to register on the electoral list on the election day, and withdraw the right to vote for citizens with registration in the criminal register.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required the voters to present a photo ID card.
The first country to introduce this request was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indian law was confirmed by the Supreme Court of the USA in 2008.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this procedure to other countries.
Over the past two years, they have supported the proposals of such laws in 34 states to force voters to present their identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens do not own, i.e. 21 million people of the age to vote, any identity card issued by the government of their state.
Furthermore, it has no such identity card for about five million new voters in 2012.
Moreover, it often costs more than $100 to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young, minority and low-income people.
25% African-Americans, 15% under $35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, are known to be attached to democratic candidates, are not entitled in several states to use their identity card with photos issued by their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs, who choose more Republican candidates, to use the cards issued by these clubs in elections.
By 2004, there was no State requirement for proof of citizenship at the elections.
Arizona introduced the first such request.
Since 2011, some twelve countries have adopted laws that lay down the obligation for voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at reducing the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It is necessary to note that two of the three Hispanics prefer a democratic party.
The Republican legislators in 2011 supported laws in eight states that cancel the voter registration on the day of the election.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the general elections in 2004, campaigns for the registration of voters helped to register about 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 led to a 17% decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In another five states, Republican legislators adopted laws aimed at shortening the election period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of African-American voters voted ahead, although African-American voters in this country were only 13%.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They accounted for only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting ahead.
On the other hand, the white people who represented 76% of all voters were only 46% of the voters who voted ahead.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters opposed the approval of laws restricting the registration of voters.
The Democratic Governors have blocked several draft laws with their veto.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, the U.S. Attorney General even hit.
The damage was partly reduced.
For example, only 16 out of 34 countries have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
The new rules, however, will indisputably make the exercise of voting rights difficult in 2012.
The democratic critics speak first of all of the biases of the approved laws and consider them to be an obvious attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in the key states.
The 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states where these laws were approved represent 171 out of 270 votes in the electoral assembly necessary for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too soon to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is clear today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Revealing prostate cancer: completing examination or not?
The PSA test led, however, to poor results, which were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All of this has increased the hesitation of men who have already been so reluctant to go to the examination at all.
Letting yourself be examined or not?
We've asked for the opinion of two experts.
The studies conducted in the USA showed a high level of contamination between the different groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and to make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a difference in mortality among patients who had undergone the examination and those who had not.
This study has also shown after 12 years that those who fail to study have a 30% to 40% higher risk of metastases.
So I recommend an examination from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more vulnerable groups.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is exposed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and those that are insensitive.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not to treat necessarily prostate cancer, which has no impact on life in the long term, and to focus in these cases rather on active disease surveillance.
Today, a number of men diagnosed with cancer are not being treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten them.
Rather, we will propose active surveillance, and if disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
More and more often, and with greater precision, we set criteria that help in deciding which type of treatment and which one does not.
Still, I suggest you take the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether or not it is appropriate to have an examination.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement created a tool that allows to assess for and against in connection with the PSA examination.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, it seems the best means of reducing the risk of disease adopting principles of healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided if everyone ate healthyly and moved sufficiently.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would be at least 50%," underlines André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian cancer research company.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the disease caused the cancer to inherit.
Some percentage is also completely unexplained.
The fight against smoking remains a priority for the Canadian cancer research society, even if the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers still in Quebec today," says spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the smoker has stopped smoking, the risk of death on cancer is halved.
Weight
Body weight and obesity are, according to SCC, another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity for life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrition
That organisation also recommends reducing the consumption of red meat.
If consumed too high, it may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid the same colds for which the same applies.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to cancer," says the report.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet reached clear conclusions.
Vitamin E studies are, according to the SCC, conflicting.
Although one of them believes that the risk of prostate cancer will be reduced, other studies are rather talking about an increase in prostate cancer.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu further insists on the importance of talking about his family fears and precedents with his doctor.
"To do an examination doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs boson examined
Notice of the likely discovery of Higgs' boson triggered a legitimate start last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
Furthermore, it is the last particle, the existence of which predicts the standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of the mass - which has not yet been observed empirically.
But there is no 100% certainty among physics that it is Higgs' boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to Higgs' boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the major physical congress in Kyoto rather confirm it, but there are still no data available to ensure absolute certainty.
But let's assume it's Higgs' boson, because the risk of error seems like a small one, and let's see what it's really about.
In this world, an unquestionable law applies, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and don't try too hard or you'll get hurt.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that there is also a similar law: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quart state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
It further divides the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obey Pauli’s principle.
And at the other end, there are bosons, evil anarchists, who appreciate nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by way of absolutely amazing), which is The Partial Adventure, in the Berkeley labs: the mesons that we leave here unnoticed, and the "powerful particles" that spreads great natural forces with which Higgs' boson is probably related in some way.
It is necessary to say, however, that these bosons are not as exotic animals as you might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: photon, or "part of light", which is the "bearer" of electromagnetic force.
When particles with electric charge accelerate or change their direction, they "interrupt" with this electromagnetic field in this particular place, just like a pebble thrown into the pond.
This "interference" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - i.e. one of the bosons, "bearers of power".
A more stable field
It's also with Higgs' boson, only with the difference that "interrupt" is a different field, Higgs' field to appear this boson.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; very high energy values must be achieved to excitation, just like the frozen surface of the pond, which is only short of a very large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as an accelerant in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with favorable volumes is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - so that such energy can be developed.
The analogy with electromagnetic field is once again useful to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
With the electromagnetic field, they don't react to all the particles or all the materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - for example, a piece of paper will never keep itself on the refrigerator.
And yet, with Higgs field, they don't react with all the particles: those they do have a certain mass, while others (such as photons, let's look at it) don't have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks what all these researches are for, what "will they bring us"?
From a scientific point of view, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to subject themselves to any inconsistencies between observations and forecasts of MS.
In addition, few physicists literally wish to find them because the slightest difference could open the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model has so far huge shortcomings, it does not bring any clarification of gravity (see!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of space matter (repeat!).
However, CERN has not yet discovered such a contradiction.
Responses
The responses of this research to Mr. and Mrs. Novák's daily life can only be predicted very difficult, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be no such thing.
See, in the early 1960 ’ s, the laser pioneers in Bell’s labs had no idea of the revolution that would trigger their work.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physik Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous rays were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered such a "toy to the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, application may result from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle didn't plan it at first, now serves as a "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, that doesn't mean that activities around LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but that means that you never really know...
Palliative Care - The best way to get out of life...
Through his committee on dignified death, Quebec has recently been involved in a delicate question concerning the end of life.
The debate should be continued soon and at the same time the bill is being drafted.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to take a closer look at this issue.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterégie.
His prostate cancer provided him with a two-year delay.
"They've given me five years of life and it's already seven years," she says without emotion on her bed in the palliative care house of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he went the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its job: the great weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet himself or just eat himself.
He's looking back at a tastefully looking breakfast, and he agrees that we're gonna help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop by, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
Courage to ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," he says.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In the whole life, one learns that men urinate," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Going back to the baby stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some.
"Consistent on the abilities of which man" if he accepts the return, the psychologist claims.
In the opinion of a number of people involved in palliative care, the fundamental moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients entering their home with palliative care for Victor-Gadbois suffer all cancer.
Their prognosis is up to three months.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who take care of them do not provide so-called "medicine" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die of suffocation in full consciousness.
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I have no wish in my life," she says, and then she lets us put on a breathing device.
Yet, he is still looking forward to his son’s last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, provide body care with the help of nutrition.
That's how palliative care comes in if there's nothing else you can do.
To make death more comfortable.
One bed of palliative care in Québek accounts for 11,700 inhabitants.
That is very little if we realize that we will all die once.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, a touch of brandy or pepsi can be given to him, according to his taste.
Diabetic patients no longer have to watch their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
They were carrying Mr. X's beer last night, which later died last night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care Services.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois go days after days, but they don't resemble each other.
In addition to a 32 - year - old man who rejoices in his last encounter with his family, thoroughly based on pillows, while he drinks in his honor, a tragically - 36 - year - old man dies surrounded by his parents, his wife, and two young children after he has tried every opportunity to survive.
"For six months now, there are always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer up to 45 years old," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% come from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care, which is intended to alleviate suffering once the patient has reached the final stage of his life, whether it is at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the company for domestic palliative treatment of the Grand Montréal area, specialize more or less solely in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental inaccessibility of health care in Quebec that leads to a number of doctors specialising in palliative care fearing the adoption of the euthanasia law and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation with peaks in palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, where they show their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not sufficiently efficient to ensure access for all persons to quality palliative care before it is possible to agree to euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who had spent 14 days in the E.R. in severe pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
They are concerned that patients should not be asked to kill because of their lack of proper care.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists tend to their patients until the last moments, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
Hélène Richard's hope of survival was quite minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist I was done with treatment, she replied that she regretted stopping fighting, telling us.
And yet she told me it was over!
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who wish to die thank their physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when their palliative cunt team eased their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is certainly not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Grand Montréal Domestic Palliative Care Society, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that will put the patient to sleep until the moment of the end, either in impact or whether the sedatives are administered permanently.
We cannot pretend not to see this part of suffering.
A patient whose pain is not removed will be given an ever greater opportunity to access palliative sedatives.
The patients who are not sedated always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I want you to get rid of my pain."
The implementation of this report enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in Health.
Extensive Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Travel management officials, contractors in construction and public works, lobbyists in political parties and experts in the Italian mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafias mix.
This "branch" came very expensive tax payers, particularly between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has been torn apart since we took the essential measures," says ironicly Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebish MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
Thanks to this, a scandal broke out in 2011 on the basis of a consistent investigation into the embezzlement of funds in connection with the road construction contracts in Quebec, which was approved by the then liberal Quebian Prime Minister Jean Charest after a long delay.
The "Duchesneau Report" confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque funding of the parties and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the 2010 investigation," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport saved a billion dollars on contracts," when some people kept their instincts in check to gain a share of them!
Charbonneau's commission "has already brought two mayors to their resignation," she adds with the hope that she will succeed in "exposing the enigma of some people".
Permanent Unit for the Fight against Corruption, established in 2011
A permanent corruption unit established in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, policemen of the "Marteau type" who have since 2009 ensured that the Montreal "cartel of money pipelines" significantly mitigates inflating orders...
In recent weeks, several tours have been carried out and accused of fraud and corruption by several municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one suburban village.
The next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his duties as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He's suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito created a sensation by explaining to the Commission the "system" mechanism for obtaining public contracts.
He himself devoted 3% of the value of the contracts he obtained in Montréal to the mafia mediator, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal, for which he ran for mayor of Gérald Tremblay.
After 2000, he was generous to all parties and devoted more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (approximately €68 000) to the provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted that he organised an illegal fundraising for former liberal vice prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money pipelines the price of which he has increased
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surfrenant, a former traffic engineer, described him very closely before the commission: within ten years he received gifts from the construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with money pipelines for which he gave the prize.
Other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they had paid their fees for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through false multi-work.
The organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblay of blinding his eyes to the parallel budget that brought dirty money into his cash register.
On the basis of these revelations, Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, bringing Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Roueau was among the first Montreal MPs to give a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Praires district in the east of the island, since 2010, it has been argued against the sale of a municipal property purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the middle of a thriving real estate business.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
About the investigation that will finally start, he says that "he's pulling strings in an effort to understand the functioning of ant system to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
According to her, the process is "painful, but positive."
We are in a wound-cleaning phase, but it is necessary to set up a unit of investigation in Montréal and ensure that these dubious practices cannot return.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have alienated hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is especially worried about the role of "concerned MPs" unless they have gone into this mess!
He estimates that 70% of the funding of the election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and ironically adds: "I heard it's just a weak outburst of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100, but it does not suggest that the situation will be resolved: "Until electoral spending is strictly limited, dirty money from politics will not disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system of public procurement and funding of the parties: "We cannot fall any further; if we boldly focus on the substance of things, we can build again on firmer foundations and with greater control and compliance."
If this story has blackened the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends to all those who mock him to look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you and the PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals have gone into each other or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players came to us.
Every day, I get next to them.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier in the fights.
Things are going so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in the preparation at INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne I have always shifted by individual degrees.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
The reinforcements of this summer are used to playing games on a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for a game and wants to give the maximum performance.
And in addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele who played the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European trainers.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's gonna win more titles in Paris.
I had a calming conversation with him in January.
I've had a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How are you looking at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our lead.
But we're staying in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have made it very easy to advance to the eight-finals.
What's your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group in front of Port first, so we can play eight finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
In order for Paris to become a major European club, it must win titles and register in history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this happen.
And would it be a great failure not to win in the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We still missed him a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had the strength to win.
We had a great season.
We've raised 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think it's gonna work out this year.
Even though large teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux seek the title, I think we have weapons at our disposal to defeat them.
Do you think PSG media expect too much?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what's been invested here and what players we have.
That's completely acceptable.
It's a fact that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something in the papers that they blame us for, it's not very pleasant.
You ask what more people can ask of you.
Of course, it's not possible to win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In Liza of the Masters we proved we could play.
Look at Manchester City, which hasn't been through the second season in the eight-finals, and they've also invested large amounts!
Given the invested amounts, you might expect to have a head start before the other 15 points!
That insults the other clubs and the French leagues.
Lyon and Marseille Clubs, which did not do very well last season, have moved on to the next phase with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the 1st League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems that the PSG is relying on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovich in everything.
It's a good thing they say there's a Zlatan addiction.
That means that Ibrahimovich is very powerful and he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here to prove he's the star of the 1st League.
Wherever he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
On our team we respect man and player.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow together.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French representation?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I've been there, and I came out stronger.
Today I am also able to play good games in the representation.
And that's what I've hoped for since I joined the team.
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to the example of our appearance.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the national team?
He's got results for him.
We're in a good place at MS qualification.
Coach chooses strictly, he's close to the players and he can get excited about winning.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualified for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) from October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This game gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I did not experience such a struggle in my career.
With Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often the truth within these technologies, there is a clear political outlook here: the belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), represents both virtual money (although transferable to dollars, euro...), as well as a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows you to exchange files between pairs of partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin rate first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to $2, today it is at the border of about $10 (the course overview is shown on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, it is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this in its report on virtual finance, which was published in October.
Bitcoin calls it "the most successful virtual money", "competing dollar and euro" and "the likes of ordinary money".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money by being like "credits" used to advance a video game that you get with a game or that you can buy (and eventually even change back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority shall check and process individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the register of current accounts, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers are all nodes.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A file related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase lies in writing this new transaction into this book.
It is done by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers, whose resolution, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
This is a stage of file cutting; i.e. about transforming a huge set into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then will they "cut apart".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (good zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then be shown indelibly connected to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the print.
If the user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each has a different print.
A computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by 21 million, but it can be divided into 100 millionths, so the margin space is...
The difficulty of the task is also increasing with an increasing level of calculation.
The net has seen its rise and downfalls.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
"The used loophole does not affect the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a company for payments with real money that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players such as Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizman Institute in Israel have recently analyzed the book of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not encircled.
In November, "Obrowski discounts" were launched.
"30,000 dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who is involved in turning bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a teaching book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless pay phone, but uses Bitcoin to verify transactions that are cheaper thanks to it.
Moreover, the host manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up for traders where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just give an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, says Pierre Noizat, which ensures that he already has thousands of users.
The general movement is being challenged by hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin makes a move, it will take a while, but 2013 could be a decisive year," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
The French forces have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US troops should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside who were punished suffered the most harm because we thought they were terrorists.
And so have we, for we've lost 88 soldiers killed, and what about all those injuries and mutilations?
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often rural ones who refuse the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbekistans, Tajiks have joined them.
They now experience tolerance and often help from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I followed from the tops of mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, took place in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without attacking under the air escort helicopter.
The Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The conditions have changed considerably since their unstoppable procedure in 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the earth was in the blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their takeover of control of the country was then considered to be a kind of exemption, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these villagers, which was completely controlled by the Al-Qa'ida organization, but their situation has not improved in our time.
The former Mujahedini, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree in an effort to maintain women in a subordinate position.
The chief dignitaries of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became traders, took possession of the state land they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American subcontracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were never even in battle.
From what I've heard in the campaign, people want a government that thieves won't make.
Many young people want to leave as will those who have managed to benefit from American generosity: the escape of capital is significant.
The young is already tired of war and its associated ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they learned about the modern world and its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; there are currently 5 million people in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will need to be given a job, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to corruption of certain representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish series, which show the modern world, watch everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that will stand up to her be considered legitimate?
Some of the commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already restoring provincial militias that will be outside central power control.
Afghanistan, a high-level country with a strong influence on local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation along the lines of Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so that the Prime Minister's post, which had existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
His country, however, has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam is operational, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced but fruit and vegetables.
My priority is private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government infrastructure control would be necessary.
Rumor has it that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And that just gave the feeling that the Western states were here only to take hold of it.
Without energy for the treatment of iron ore or copper on the spot and without resources for the transport of raw materials over the mountains, however, no mining of minerals can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine Mes Aynak and have left international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist site to preserve the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of both imports and exports depend, to restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty foresees the continuation of common types of assistance: girls' and boys' lycea, French department at universities, French institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative to "get a heart and a soul" has been working in an effort to reconcile aid and military activities, in which the service of the "citizen-armament" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, has achieved, thanks to the countless French NGOs, a number of successes in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural renewal in dozens of mountain villages.
These work, involving many local workers, helped to dampen the rebellions: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of a productive area.
What memory will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often at an altitude of over 2,000 metres.
The embassy received dozens of written applications for minor agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Capisa.
In order for these farmers to be free from the insurrection led by foreign groups, they wish, in their words, to achieve little civil assistance to their benefit, which would be properly controlled and affect them directly.
Hard work at the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursi started another poker game.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the publication of the Constitution, which temporarily confers unrestricted powers on it, it has decided to play the vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all the others, that the Constitutional Assembly will approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted the assembly a further two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, which weakens the country's constitutional stability and leads to legal conjecture.
This new initiative has further strengthened the country's split-up.
From the point of view of the opposition, the President remains in his "autocracy deliria", continues to "break his word" and "walks the law".
However, its supporters ensure that it is a means to turn the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that forces the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text of the Egyptians to clarify an article after the article.
It is also a way for the President to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country is refuting protests.
As confirmed in the interview for American weekly Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially because this quickly organised vote puts the Egyptian people ahead of the ultimatum: "You will approve my text, or I will retain unlimited powers", which should otherwise be terminated after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special air yesterday, 85 Members of that constitutional assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most liberals were missing the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was declared, they banged the door, saying they had no chance to enforce their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their step.
In order to achieve the capacity, 11 substitutes were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles of the constitution have often been voted unanimously.
The commentators continued to suspend the fact that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... the hours for prayer, when some members of the committee held the view that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains in line with the version of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of the Sharia law are the main source of justice".
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped to replace the term "principle" with the term " Rule", which would allow for a more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for the rest of the Egyptian society.
"The hypocrisy," the liberals argue, who only see a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of Al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular on the question of the compliance of laws with the law of Sharia.
According to an expert in Egypt, Sophie Pompier, it is disturbing because "the people called to express are not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of theocracy."
The concerns of liberals are even more excite by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the existing one.
"For the time being, there has been no concrete religious consequence.
Egypt remains a framework citizen with this constitution.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulamic, but university workers, many of them studied in French schools," Alexis Bluet's mild concern, who is losing his job on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that "there may be a contradiction with the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to a religious dictionary.
There is, in particular, a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic Legal Science, note red.].
And in the future, there may be a question of the extent to which civil judges are competent to express themselves."
Yesterday's approved text is highly criticised, in addition to the religious pages, because of the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there is a significant restriction on the former regime.
Another disputed place: powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military representatives, the defence budget will not be verified by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, civil proceedings will not be prohibited in military courts, as requested by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
These associations speak of their doubts in connection with the text they believe to be directed against freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the President of Egypt was supposed to be performing on TV last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Then the leaders of the Head of State will manifest on Saturday.
In Israel there are sacred places, buds of the world and sea from saturated salt solution waiting for Ukrainian tourists
The promised earth combines the size of Bible truths, modern comfort and the integrity of nature.
AaF identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
To bow to the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God’s mercy will descend upon all who enter this “ spa. ”
And Galilee - instead of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming down the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers will pass through the Way of pain, or Jesus ’ Cross (Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fort of Antonia - Pretoria - where judgment took place, walks through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's tomb on Mount Golgota - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of anointing and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which they made a cross for Jesus' crucifixion.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - Wall of lamentation, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Business the way around the vertical
The ruins of Masada remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who engage in climbing can get to it with their own strength.
The others will take the cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous ski resort Hermon, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists from the foot of the hill take a shuttle bus.
The total length of mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, the pagan gods lived on top of the mountain.
Visit Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't all visit during one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judah Desert, and also some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth a visit.
In his exhibition, the impressionists and expressors of Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented in their canvass.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Bash Museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with mannequins of spa users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the unique private museum of Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance fee is free and the gifts are strictly rejected.
The fifth museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - talks about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the Museum - Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and you find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also presented.
Improving your health
The three major spa resorts of Israel are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea you can also bathe in the winter months, because the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees Fahrenheit and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe all year round.
The dead sea is, by the way, the most strange sea in the world, located at the lowest continental point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps the surface and the people who can't swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to treat yourself with saltwater - salty, and medicinal mud that can treat your dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes to cure your nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them was the famous sea road connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
Indeed, tourists love walking through narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press against the walls in the alley of "your" sign, your happiness will be favorably inclined.
In Jaffa you may meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even from other countries to get taken.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "receive" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
Carefully renovated theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: around 30% of the Russian population is speaking in this country.
It is better to take money with you not in euro, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now there is a dollar of about 3.8 shekels).
City transport is mainly by buses, but in Jerusalem there is a speed tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the lower town with the upper one.
It's basically an underground cableway.
Traveling all kinds of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday, according to the Jewish tradition.
From Friday evening until sundown on Saturday, it ceases to work in markets, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts a week of work.
In many cafés, restaurants and hotels you will only get kosher meals: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without scales and meals, which contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish mashed potatoes hummus, various kinds of sauces, balls made of ground cistern - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israel.
But there are a lot of fed cats who are graciés "walking according to their taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on roofs of parked cars.
Leading cats love populated places, and tasteful to go into every goodness.
Car rental will cost from 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost on average 30 shekels.
Numbers expressed
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Most of US citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to know the country and to rest.
The promised country was visited from January to October 2012 by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa waiver on 9 February 2011.
"Big and mighty" announces it to Moscow: emigrants save their money for their language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still discussing the Act on Compulsory Language Exams, there have already been frauds in the country selling "false" certificates
13 million foreign workers arrive every year in Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into force, according to which every working migrant will be obliged to pass an examination of the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal sectors, lifestyles and retail sales.
However, FMS promises that the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors in time.
However, the tests will consist not only of language knowledge but also of Russian history and the fundamentals of law.
Knowledge of the language will also have to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is not subject to even the people who succeeded in obtaining the certificate and obtaining the academic diploma of the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, convictions and protection of rights
The network of test points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of friendship between nations, Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres are already open in Russia today.
The initiative to support the implementation of the testing was supported by members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have been able to ask the question in the press many times: and what will that actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
Thus, first of all, it will be possible to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "slaved labor".
Many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers today, as explained by the chairman of the FMS Council of Russia in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights should be initiated before they leave.
Only the organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with the conviction of Sebelev - the future migrant is sentenced to clashes with dishonorable people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "show" to horrible, tight hostels in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, will suffer for months without food and documents and will work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their country, but when they arrive, they cheat them, they confiscate their passports, they do not pay the promised wages," confirms the head of the Tajik administration of the labour migration MS Tolib Šaripov.
Don't!
The less that many citizens of the Central Asian Republic, who intend to go to Russia for work, recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get into, but do not even have experience with the work in question.
Of course, it is not as much their fault as their misery: only very few Turks, Uzbekistans, Tajik can afford at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families also need to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, put on shoes and equipped for school.
As children grow up in a productive age, they must go to work on the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and less valuable."
It is true that with regard to the Law on Language Tests, human rights ombudsmen point to one important thing.
The testing will only be carried out for migrants who have a legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even be taking tests or getting any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live as they used to in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or not forbidden,
Many of the incoming workers claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police personnel know that we have basically false documents, without registration, and that's why there are cases of blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," he shared with journalists his experience with the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy a painting"
On the first day of validity of the Language Act, it was found that false documents were not only for migrants to register.
FMS employees have already confiscated several false certificates of completion of the language exam.
Counterfeiting documents are printed on an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get a free one: each of the migrants in the hope of facilitating the problem of passing tests, he paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times the amount of the official test: it's going to cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to protect the system from corruption, so that workers cannot simply buy documents, that is what both government officials and human rights defenders agree.
So far, the government can promise foreign workers who have failed tests for the first time the time needed for them to take the course of the basic Russian language.
Visitors who do not know Russian are expected to work in areas where active dealings with people are not required.
MVD (Ministry of Interior) does not bring an illegal arms market into circulation
The share of criminal offences using legally held weapons is very low
The Russian MVD submits a proposal to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is a reaction of government authorities to recent events: the instigation of shootings at weddings that were unsacrificed, and the massacre prepared by Moscow's attorney Dimitri Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the use of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which to obtain a gun license from 18 to 21 years old.
This idea is supported by the Head of the Committee on Security and the Fight against Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be presented to the State's pride in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "strengthening screws".
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - require the refusal of "inconceivable tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasili Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the BBC's Russian editor.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's statistics, 142 crimes were committed in six months of 2012 using firearms registered by the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of an open letter are convinced that tightening up civil weapons legislation will not make the perpetrators switch to the "black" market.
According to their words, any low-priced weapon can currently be found in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "Black" arms market is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years at the Department of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot sites that accept weapons orders
The first one - "Army or Military Way", means a weapon that was alienated during the battles in the Caucasus.
"The guns were also stolen by Russian officers and caucasians themselves," says the Lamb.
Another type of "black weapons" are the weapons of stolen criminals with the representatives of the security forces.
The Lamb explains that this includes the theft from police stores and weapons stolen directly from the employees of the authorities in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" gets sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It is proven that some fires were set on purpose - to cover the manka," says the former soldier.
Both Barance and arms manufacturers make their contribution.
"At present, private arms companies are being created that are not competitive on the international market and exclude weapons that supply to the black market, including Moscow," says this expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in painting, and a mafia was created that organized their smooth production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have added what is the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
In 2011, the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design prepared a report on this issue.
The experts discussed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, say researchers, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market "the guilt of official agents whose work is linked to weapons," says the report.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons are from armed conflicts, 14% of the weapons were stolen in their production, 5% are "black archaeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the arms stores who asked us not to mention his name is convinced that the weapons found in the black "archeology" excavations have no longer been bought - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers go straight to military warehouses for new shipments.
Over the Ensign, the interested party will buy a unit, such as a TT gun.
You order a gun with him and he'll sell it to you through the fence.
"He will take it to the city and sell it for 900 euros per piece with two containers," he says.
"The truth is that the police are in the picture, and that's why whenever a plan starts to burn in the light of the crime, they're going to make a check-up on illegal arms dealers," he adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The sellers most often find each other through their friends.
I was visiting websites and blogs until the guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the trial platform, where there would be a man who would lead me to "the end" where we would act together.
I learned the prize mainly there.
Military Rapporteur Viktor Baranec
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, a salesman tells a counselor.
The sellers are on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically, "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell him that the daughter had lost a tooth."
And now I'm going to get there through a person I'm sure of.
He also delivers them only to me because he knows I won't turn them in.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was working on a stand for publication on the subject.
The diagram did not change according to his words.
They gave him a photo album, "everything you thought of."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," remembers a soldier.
The buyer, according to the words of the Lamb, does not offer rabbits in a bag - you can try everything.
Me, a potential client, I'm just not buying - we're going to the woods with the seller and we're going to build a target.
"They'll give me the chance to shoot, and if I can convince myself that the gun is shooting well, we start to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Stock on the couch
The search engines will bring you to both the website and the group on "Contact" where you can buy a gun "for different purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings to do that.
"It's enough to have a set amount of money," says the advertising headline on the website "Buy a combat gun or a vending machine".
On this website, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And the sale to minors?
"Of course without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the recipe is preserved).
"I'll buy TT.Moscow" - concisely formulate the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently set up a massive network of web sites, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can rake a shovel.
People grunt like hungry fish on bait and then mine coal in Siberia.
Military rapporteur and senior military officer Viktor Baranec
I have heard of such diagrams:web pages are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make payment via the ATM.
"In response to this, the seller will send him a photograph and a description with instructions where the weapon is hidden," says Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranec confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can stay without a gun and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, you will pay, according to expert estimates, an amount of between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kisl's non-governmental organization, "Right to Arms" you'll get a gun from Makarov for between $100 and $300.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is dispatched from storage to long-term storage through storage facilities in the middle of the article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7% compared to the period January - October 2011, with 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of reported cases of theft and blackmail of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the U.S., fast food and supermarket workers strike
"McDonald" will go through up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In the last few days, a wave of protests against low wages has risen in Walmart hypermarkets and fast food chain restaurants such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn to wave nine or whether it is due to disappear soon.
The entire event is supported by unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in the modest salaries received by staff in Walmart and fast food systems, the aim of the protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their trade union organisations.
Currently, this economic sector is practically intact by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called 'black Friday', when the orgy of cheap sales hit America, millions of people were caught up, and in some cases they were accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart workers, who are working on 2.2 million people worldwide, have left their workplaces and have demonstrated together with the trade chain unions and left-wing activists of multinational companies, whose goods are intended for lower- and middle-class people.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-wage employees at Walmart stores only buy at their own place of work.
The availability and range of goods have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods so cheaply in part because few pay its employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or manual scanners.
The demonstrators on "black Friday" demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company increased sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee gets $9.5 per hour, but that does not correspond to the amount of expenditure, says the staff.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley show that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company spends on wages now.
If Walmart transfers the increase in wages to the consumer's shoulders fully, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend around $12.39 more than today.
Walmart’s lawyers point out that the protest only took place in nine countries and that it should not cause virtually no damage.
"Black Friday" lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, her cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on "black Friday".
Dan Fogelman’s representative stated in an interview for the left-handed Huffington Post website that the jobs left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all "further media sensations" organized by the trade unions.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their aim was not Walmart commercial homes (they are not very popular in this progressive city, and therefore they are almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't pay you sick and he doesn't pay you for your honest work!
Kirane Williams, member of the City Council in New York
At present, the minimum wage for work is in accordance with federal law and New York State regulations of $7.25 an hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wage, but only slightly, and on average, their staff in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
There's no lower wages in this expensive city.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
The "McDonald" employs almost a quarter of the American teenagers who work on the school counter for part-time and live with their parents.
Few people see their main source of living or plan to stay there for a long time.
I am currently constantly meeting with the "McDonald" workers who complain that they must live on this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, at the Wall Street Journal Forum, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
The protesters, who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday on "McDonalda" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks in fast food companies start receiving at least $15 an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also called for trade union organizations to be established in the sphere of rapid refreshments.
American laws prohibit the administration of preventing the establishment of trade union organizations and punishing activists of the trade union movement by bullying and firing.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
However, the introduction of a trade union organisation in fast food companies is also complex for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Disagree
On this day, loud protests were also held in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the event was at noon at the "McDonalda" meeting near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, especially a member of the town council of Kircane Williams, who said: "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't pay you sick and pays you for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as a candidate for the mayor of the city of Billa de Blasio, who said that "we must perform together in support of fast-food workers in order to achieve a fair reward for their work and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American sphere of fast refreshments.
But there were only a few hundred people in it, although far from all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark that will light the flame of the mass movement is unclear yet.
"So far, the brain can deceive on average"
Among the fans of modern virtual reality technology is a popular theme of extended reality; recently it means to perceive the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, Google presented a working model of this news at its annual conference, and in November it was announced that Microsoft also applied for the relevant patent.
The interview with the leader of an interactive 3D technology group in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadi shows that the glasses are already the past for the scientists of this company.
The perspective of handling virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces is drawn.
- Please tell us in a framework what your research group is doing.
- We're dealing with the interaction of man with machines, but at the same time we're trying to move the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has been stuck in the process of working with pixels on a flat screen, and at most sometimes it touches the screen with a finger.
We want to look back 5-10 years ahead and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone there is a very interesting control option using gestures.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Notwithstanding the fact that Kinect has transferred the interaction to a physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system accepts more data), but the output flow has not yet been separately.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more suitable form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It certainly cannot be considered as a panacea - there is a question of privacy, because we do not always want to inform others in our surroundings of our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, we had a project to control the equipment in public places in which we thought about gestures, but not about the squirming ones, just such squirming, short ones.
The gesture would not eat with a camera device, but with a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
So far, it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a bracelet.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get the users to adapt to what a machine can or cannot do at a given moment?
- That's not necessary, but it's mutual convergence.
In the near future, I think we will need to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors that provide a relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you are to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or anything else today?
- Basically, the current generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But it's not just the megapixel itself, it's like the matrix and the depth.
At the same time, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to designers of algorithms.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So the speed, the number of frames per second is also very important.
Human movement is quite dynamic and the current data flows of 30 images per second are frankly a little bit short, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with a adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, serial-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects the interaction of a person with a machine.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, I just don't need that much touch, but I need some extra images per second.
And it's not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- Three cameras are now being used in Kinect's system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of a reflected signal.
And the third camera -- it's actually a regular visual band sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or worsen it because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue system, to play with a curved camera location and see how it will help in determining a three-dimensional position.
- As I recall, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not present his glasses publicly.
Don't you think that when it comes to everyday use of extended reality technology through special glasses, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "transferable" form of the expansion of reality, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphones, projection display and around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in which there is their strength (only you see private things), and at the same time weakness - extended reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that widespread reality - that is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in interaction between man and machine.
I think supplementing the senses could be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is being used - using the other hand as a certain type of display.
He's excellent at recording compressions!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tangibleity to these "images in the air" - for example, interference with several directional ultrasonic rays at the defined point where the finger is located, causing a palpable feeling, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on the belly of your fingers.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive your brain?
So he thinks he can feel what he seems to feel at any given moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a person physically located in a very tight space to believe that he is walking through an open, practically infinite space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country tracks (not like clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If brain deception becomes a target, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so attractive for researchers - many things are at the very beginning.
Vkusovsky instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the "Petrohradian avant-garde" project, dedicated to citizens who are leading, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list, important figures of the art scene of St Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe, without reaching the turnout.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who's all dressed in red, who you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashion pubs and openings.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they're exposed, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - he is a prominent man of the St Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition to being a city person, his appearance on the streets makes people smile, it makes everyone feel better.
He recently took the bottle and became a petrohradian bottlemaker because he had matured into this complex role with his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you walking all over town in red and not yellow or, for example, in turquoise?
- I chose red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, imagemaker and the public.
Although in general, everything that differs a little bit from gray is aggressive and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at establishing an interview.
The whole history of my provocative actions is, above all, an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Culture House in Nevsky where my work was exposed.
I understand what my path is.
That's when a wave of free, unofficial artists crossed, and I couldn't understand the new, free types of artists.
I made friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gasonian ones who brought us to "Puškinské 10", and there were no other waves.
It lures me to the theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except the word.
- And it all came together in your art clinic... - It was important for me to be in the centre of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a place on Pushkinské 10, and there was a music-art club, a Bohemian club, a home of the St.
There were many born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how the Snura brought in with the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
The string and its friends sang light songs under the skirt, dressed in adjacent Shirts, among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, she became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galian times.
We gave them the Trachtěnberg, thus began his great career, basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboyedov" - that's the accent of Art Clinic.
This is where our working and regular guests left.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something else.
In 2000 the survey was organized in the press, a special price was "People in our city".
In the "The Artist of the Year" nomination, I was appointed to finish my peak.
In the new times according to the old rules, the work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In these years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular but not too cultural.
- Your works are characterized in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which the up-to-date and penetration are captured.
I'm going to have a program show called the Russian Museum in Clowns.
Clowns are timeless categories.
I used to be sociable today is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is rubbed, tragic.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
To save the world, for example, by totalitarian disguise in the order.
Today people meet according to their clothes, they focus on external mechanics, not the inner man.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing clothes.
We just saw you as a city bottlemaker, a cultural city should have a hero like that.
And who should I be if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At the moment, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There's a breakdown of cultures.
Previously, people used to hang out in the depths, and the gods loved one thing, simple people.
Everything's broken down on the microcommunity today, it's very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everyone.
Today, you need to think about who you're going to like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
And a few thousand viewers will come to Stas Mikhail!
- Fans come at him, there's a sexually involved social sphere.
And 300 people come to the cultural land, and 10,000 don't come, and the result is less management, less money, worse everything.
I've got fans, the main thing is, nobody's gonna fool them, and they're not gonna break what's going on.
When I was young, I painted these pictures that were hanging from one collector on the wall with Falk and Laryonov.
I started with paintings that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse concepts.
They say:Principal culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, it is from elsewhere.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for drawing paintings.
And I'm for this culture.
Cyril, what's the scarcity in Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an agent over culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
It was not so in all respects during the days of proper trials, the tsars may not have understood culture much, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St Petersburg who might be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because there are a need for great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right track.
It's thriving in tasteful today.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petierburk is?
- Petierburk - it is not the capital of culture, there is a culture much more in Moscow, there is the right land.
And on our eel, art is a mess.
We need cultural land, but there are writers today more than readers, that's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our case, the layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashionable matter, as was the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented by means of the grant of St.Pecierburg
To be born in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
The caravans of space corabs with Earthlings on board are on the way, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question arises: how do we keep our family at ease or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think it's a big choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, even if hypothetically.
"He is Venus and Mars," says a high-ranking scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better living conditions on Mars, the surface of Venus is at temperatures of 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
It's possible to live there at a high altitude or in Venus orbit... in space.
The question of reproduction in space began by scientists with flora.
It was already half a century ago that plant experiments were carried out.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then an insect was carried out into orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979 a quail egg was sent into space to check how the embryo develops in a weightless state.
At the output we get an absolute normal bird.
But then trouble begins.
"A major problem with this bird having to find support, must stand on its own feet and start to move," says the head of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they don't find support, the birds fall chaotically and make cauldrons.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds had a complete loss of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they just died in four days.
"We've had birds hatched twice, but then we refused, because it's simply impossible to work with them," comments Vladimir Syčev's failure to experiment with chickens in the universe.
The last "minarian" with the animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
But in the bio-satelite "Bion," there will be only beings of one sex.
There has been an experiment with rats who have already been broadcast into space.
In fact, they didn't discover anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such experiments must be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on earth, the offspring of the cosmic rats were born.
However, the problem of reproduction in space has not yet been approached.
It's a tough task.
Animals simply cannot realize their sexual instincts when losing their usual environment.
Man, unlike animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens rules abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkov's greatest danger was.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Cheek has left, and no one on Earth could say if she could last a flight to space.
Whether she can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"No one has answered this question yet," says Vachtang Vačnadze, a veteran of the missile-space sector.
In June 1964, more than a year after a flight to space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Téreškovová gave birth.
The father of the child was also a cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman, the cosmonaut of Světlana Savická, was born, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in an open universe.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who have been born after long years and are growing healthful offspring.
"It can also be dangerous during orbital years," says Spaceman-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valeri Poljakov.
Yet, mankind must inevitably seek new paths in the fields of biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
CPK hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in conditions of zero attraction, the cosmonauts adopt the habits they need to work in an open universe.
Water mimics weightlessness.
Although the water is comfortable for adults, but in a strange way, for young children it is a natural element.
Small ichtianders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the child is on average 9 months in the mother’s foetal water and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks will pass.
"That's very little to let the baby forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a swimming instructor.
In short - if a newborn child's condition is weightlessly more natural, then for women there is more natural inevitable gravity, an attractive force.
In the condition of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the pelvis, and the body’s ability to evict the fetus, are being depleted very quickly.
We can put that aside if the muscle stimulators work at birth.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother’s organism evicts the fetus.
"What's next?" asks Valeriy Poljakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the body is not affected by Earth’s attraction, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit cannot dress as an adult into a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be deprived of what he needs to develop himself unconditionally.
"If we go with you into an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be completely unadapted to the local environment," predicts the head of the Bioethics Board of IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So childbirth in space today is just a theoretical question.
But one day, there will be a time when it will become a reality and when the earth’s people will set out in their corabs on a far - removed planet that will become the home of their descendants born in space.
Head of the SAO: Control of the Svarcsystem failed by the fault of politicians
In connection with public procurement, the Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation, but is lagging in its application.
In an interview for Aktuálne.cz, the Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, says.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct for its application - that's what I think is missing," Kala comments.
Similar conclusions also suggest joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of malpractice, Petr Nečas refers to the so-called "svarc system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother the entrepreneur with his controls - is it prohibited or permitted?
"The law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits anything, neither the Prime Minister can prevent the office, which is obliged to go to control and enforce its duties," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the public procurement legislation in both countries.
What exactly was that about?
It's a parallel check we started about two years ago.
Simply put, the point is that European legislation regulates how to deal with public contracts, followed by individual national legislation and then also by practice itself.
We put all this together, and although the check is not yet completed, we have found very interesting differences - in general, legislation is also possible in our country "severeer and more perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to pursue the application of the law itself.
What can this project help you to do, what does it mean for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to tighten the laws, reduce and improve the limits if this does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price in order to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal conduct.
But by reducing the limit of procurement, we don't necessarily have to achieve that.
Maybe the system will be so full of paper that those who want to look for holes in the system will be able to draw on it much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You're talking about domestic problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it otherwise set?
As far as the authorities are concerned, like the SAO, the Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organized like us, also has a college, it only forms a little different way, but in principle both authorities act similarly.
The powers are also to a certain extent similar, but by the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, these Courts also have these at the level of individual Lands - in which the system differs slightly from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, presented by state resources.
Public funds, which are managed by our regions and municipalities, are controlled from the level of the Federal Accounting Courts.
As for the legislation there, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is referred to as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that it is better in everything.
Is it necessary, then, that they have better controllers?
I'm sure you don't, but I'm saying again, I don't like this kind of comparison.
But it must be said that even countries that we consider to be role models face a number of problems.
Otherwise, there wouldn't be any benefit to them to cooperate with our office, would there?
With regard to domestic legislation, what does the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean to your office, does it have any impact?
As the duration of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet shown in the control actions.
Because we're doing ex-post checks, there's a certain delay to be reckoned for.
So far, we are only observing this in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new "risk detection" tool, through which we have run almost 14 thousand public contracts, and we have analysed them - there, of course, these changes will manifest, because limits will change, conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted and so on.
So do you consider the approval of this law rather to be a benefit or a further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it is confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that it will "strengthen" the rules and it will not be possible to comply with them.
Already in the operation of the previous rules, controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the Regional Council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is the law worth tightening up in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to invade and abuse it, not punish those who commit formal error that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't go.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother the businessman with the controls of the so-called "svarc system" - and what does that mean?
Svarc System is prohibited or permitted?
After all, the law has to be set up in some way, and if it prohibits anything, neither the Prime Minister can prevent the office from acting, which is obliged to go in control and enforce its duties.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and we're going to allow it," but he can't say we're going to act like nothing.
There are rather strict rules in the Public Procurement Act, as is to be formally implemented - which is correct in order to protect the public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the best bidder is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct for its application - that is what I think is missing.
Roads are frozen, but mostly mobile
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
Most of the time, however, the roads are off-road, somewhere with caution.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region this morning the roads were on the road, but the places were frozen and also snowy.
Temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but during the day it is to be slightly warming up.
The snow in the region has stopped and in the lowlands lies only a weak layer.
There is about 30 cm of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
The places were also lower visibility due to fog, according to data from the traffic of regional roaders.
The R6 high-speed road and first-class communication are now accessible without restrictions in the region.
However, caution is needed on, for example, some bridges where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All roads of the second and third class, including mountain roads, are also on the road.
In some sections, however, the remains of the frozen snow and the place of the snow run are still lying.
Particularly in higher positions, more attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubicky and Královéhradecký Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of frosting, in higher locations and in the mountains there may be a snow layer on the roads, informing on its website the Directorate of Roads and Motorways.
Drivers are warned about freezing, especially in higher locations of the Pardubicky region.
The ice can be located near Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitav or High Myth, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically, roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav are treated.
The snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia, it is most often clear to half clear today without precipitation.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree of centigrade, blowing a weak wind.
Plzeňský kraj
Roads in the Pilsen Region are on the road this morning, but with increased caution and the ride needs to be adjusted by the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, the temperatures are moving between three and nine degrees below the freezing point.
After previous snowing and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
The driver must count on the fog, but the visibility will gradually improve.
It's coming from the traffic of regional road drivers.
The D5 motorway is almost unlimited, but increased caution is recommended by the communication administrators between 80 and 131 km.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
However, frozen sections can be found in southern Pilsen and Tachov.
Communication in the second and third classes is wet and warnings of frozen sections also apply in this case.
Drivers should be careful on less frequent roads in the area of Šumava.
Olomouc Region
With snow on the road they have to count the drivers heading to the highest positions of Olomouc region today.
After the chemical spray remained in the Red Mountain saddle and on the way to the Videlski Cross.
Road drivers drove snow into the terrain at night, in Šumperk according to the road managers snowed about three inches.
In other parts of the region, roads are mostly free of restrictions.
"The remains of snow lie in the highest positions in Sumperia.
With snow on the Red Mountain saddle, drivers have to count in the direction of Jeseník," said the Šumper Road Administration Dispatch today.
Their colleagues went to Jesenick to the ground at night, the journeys to and from the highest places are now bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, the roads are unlimited, but in Šternberg the drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the roads remained wet.
Ústecký kraj, Liberecky region
This morning, a road driver in the north of Bohemia reports several difficult places.
The mountain road from Telnice to Knínice to Ústeck is closed in addition to several places with snow invaded or with a refrigerator.
Temperatures also stay below zero in lower positions, so ice and snow are likely to stay on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operating complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of the refrigerator is reported by road users especially from the area of Štětí.
According to the meteorologists, the conditions were ideal for her at night - during the day of the rain and the rolling snow, at night bright and freezing.
The adverse conditions on the I/13 road on the border between the Ústecký and Liberec region are reported from the main moves.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice forced bent branches of trees, which, under the snowbed, bent to the ground.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think of the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we people like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we're more of a joke and we say that we're the only band in the world who can collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also hold a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a national fundraiser we've been planning for two years.
We decided to exploit the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
The day before 20 December from 21:00, 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will take place simultaneously.
They will end up around the time on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar will end.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, it was probably my idea, and then we came up with everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to gathering enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which we will give this world to our children someday.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support by buying at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap band, along with other artists, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called the "end of the world cancelled".
She's very popular on YouTube today, and she's going to sound at these benefit concerts as well?
Of course, in the complete conclusion, that is, if we all succeed and the end of the world does not come to an end...
It's being sung by all the performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems are also connected in a unique direct transmission to Czech Television.
The words for this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the video played by Tomáš Hanák, singing in it also Xindl X...
How did you get in touch with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are trying hard to involve them in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What's the gain from concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the barrier-free Studeo educational centre, which we have been carrying out for the sixth year with the Tap civil association in Jedlicko Institute.
The students of the Jedlicko Institute regularly attend and take part in activities of interest and pleasure.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers themselves, so we try to allow them to do so in this way.
As part of the construction of the Jedlicko Institute, a separate building will be created in the future to which we will move this project.
Several musical groups and artists will perform at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We tried to build a program that would address all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombostic events" for the future?
In May we will be performing at Prague Spring for the first time, so even here we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the USA, would like to connect it with the performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these paths in a logistic and organisational manner?
It's not as bad as it looks at first sight.
We have five members on the electric cart, her carts must travel in the luggage compartment, and we, of course, carry a large amount of cargo and boxes with tools...
However, so far it has always been done without any problems, ČSA and British Airways have been perfectly prepared for us that I have wondered how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, that was no problem.
Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare how the individual differences in barrier, public access to disabled people and the like.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than in our country, we have witnessed in Russia that everything is still in the east at the very beginning.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, it is still unusual for a person in an electric wheelchair to move himself in the city center.
It doesn't even apply to the obvious, as if you prefer the wheelchairs in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also civil associations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, do we still have to catch up with a more advanced country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In both London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to be actively involved in social life, but we are a bit ahead of that with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrier-free is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will things start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have strong will.
The Tap Band is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I joined the Jedlicko Institute as an educator, where I had many young people around me who were interested in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing saxophone, among other things, I've set up an interesting music band with my colleague.
And over time, as our moderator Lada Angelovich says, it's a little bit out of hand (Laughter).
But did popularity come in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped when we began to connect with famous singers and also actively work on promoting the band.
We realized that a job that can't be seen, basically, as if it didn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality tutors, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it up to The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something differently.
Showbusiness is overcrowded with things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in a way, everything new is accepted carefully and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that's natural...
But the regret is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop themselves, of course, provided that they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something goes wrong with people with disabilities, it's not just for them, it's for the whole company.
Did this success also help by being a strict boss, as many people have identified you?
When we want to do quality work, we need to be uncompromising about many things and require some discipline.
I mean, that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and a head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, go to the preparation and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, the enthusiasm will leave them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
Currently, the band The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave and come, it's impossible to stop.
Who has the will and the taste, always has the door open
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21:00
In Prague, Incheba arena, Brno Flueda and Ostrava will take place with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be connected by a telemost to sing the song of the band The Tap Tap "The End of the World Canceled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational centre STUDEO at the Jedlicko Institute in Prague in the volume of CZK 25 million
Entrance to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old have free entry tickets in the presale Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was adopted as a 20th member of this European Space Agency as a second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
However, Poland's journey to space began much earlier.
Flights to space were devoted to Polish enthusiasts before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I will remind you, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, which represented the ideas of his pioneering work The Entrance to Space.
The thoughts of a young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cool and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for Entering Space in France.
The remembered Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of cosmonautics and his contribution was appreciated even by the fact that one of the craters on the other side of the Moon was named on his behalf.
As early as 1925, a railway drone was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the design is unknown and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the run-in or the drive-by.
The information about this tribe is known only from the daily press.
Since 1933, missile missiles have begun to handle the Polish artillery.
The research was provided by the Cell of Armament Technology in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckieg.
It is clear from the preserved materials that research has reached the stage of practical trials.
However, the arrival of the German troops was interrupted.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by Rohoziński engineer, appeared in the professional press, and in the following year the works of Rocket - air torpedo and rocketbomb of the airman by Lewna-Krzywoblocký were published.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Temporary Advisory and Science Committee) coordinated all the work with all the projects of military use of rocket technology.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity its activity ended the start of the war.
Further work on space after the war in the Polish press appears due to the work of the Polish astronaut Society (Polish Astronautic Society).
For the first time, the company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the Problems magazine, in which four more extensive articles are devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a society that will deal with space.
By then, artificial satellite projects had already started and it was clear that space research was a prospective field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronaut Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International astronaut Federation (founded 1951) and already in autumn PTA has become a full member.
And in the following year, the first chairman of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became vice-president of the International astronaut Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has contributed significantly to the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Meteorary rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start occurred on 10 October 1958.
The rocket was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 the two-stage RM-2 rocket was launched in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development should already have been able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have access to up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, in 1962, further developments were suspended.
A successor to the first RM rocket was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and a starting weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (labelled Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed by the size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket there was a 0.4 litre, Meteor-1B of 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litre.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting mass of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is still necessary to mention the entry of Poland into COSPAR in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland was also involved in space research on Soviet artificial satellites under Interkosmos and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remkov.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The resolution triggered a live discussion in the public.
Of course, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberalised economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic bodies, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with one another.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and free, nothing limitless movement of private capital, along with unrestricted financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the price of work, (med) there is a price tension.
Under this term, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer tries to compete with the import of cheap goods by ‘impressing’ the competitor’s price in order to break down a greater market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, it means either translating production into foreign countries or cheap shopping or disappearing.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and hence the responsibility for unemployment generated by it, social expenditures of the state are necessarily growing.
The whole situation makes it clear that the masters of entrepreneurs are reluctant to pay taxes, thus replacing the economic and social damage they have done in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that no specific statistical data need to be provided.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create situations in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter a mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments give private capital a chance to their own people regardless of the social downfall.
This is reflected mainly in changes to the laws in force.
The objective is to force the economy's own population to adopt the price dictatorship of private capital in particular in the area of wages.
This is also the case with a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, both by limiting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
There have been public food outlets for poor people in the SRN for many years who cannot make use of their own work.
The number of these people is already going to millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common to see that well-employed people receive such a wage that they must be paid to existential minima.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Assembly.
The saving measures of virtually all southern EU countries undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people are under pressure from a catastrophic decline in social levels forced to emigrate as in the 19th century, or to live for hungry wages at the edge of society in the hope that one day private investment capital will arrive in the country.
But here's where to ask, but where to come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or Africans still work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim to be unable to participate capitalistly in their own economy, that the managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital insists on the view that the State must not interfere with the economy by controlling intervention.
Then we have to ask whether private capital is affecting, in fact, politics and the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the clear answer, isn't it?
Evidence is the existence of practically omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual advantages, the lawmaking, where practically everything is criminal but nothing criminal.
In the SRN there is a situation that the State Departments for a lack of funds award the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are inconsistencies with industry.
These draft laws are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people as Western constitutions say, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberalised democracy is now quickly getting into the situation, as Appianos describes in his work the crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar and Pompeia: "The state has been in complete decomposition for a long time and the authorities have been filled with violence.
For bribes, illegal possessions of favor and using stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption flowed without any barrier, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold voice" "Characterial people did not apply for the office at all, so once he was standing for eight months as a result of this coup without consuls." "It really started to talk about the only cure in a bad situation being self-government and the need to choose a energetic man." Appianos thought of Pompeia, but he became Caesar, who turned democracy into a permanent self-government.
Conclusion As in the antiquity, the current company is based on a reckless preference for its own benefit irrespective of its social interest.
Private capital is, by its very nature, no longer able to understand and implement the social benefits.
The result is now, just like then, the unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort to reform deeper.
We must therefore look for the causation of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As it stands, the demise of these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be regarded as a break with the expectation of the next round.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that present elites are completely ignoring in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing together with crimes against humanity, as we know them from both old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure of competition at both international and at European level, the Czech Government will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms, which will strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the society in favour of the state.
Israel: The chaos lab.
Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of reactions have emerged.
Some stand for Israel, argue its right to self-defense, and Palestinians match the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide of Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel match the role of the terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is in the periodic wave of killing the culprit and who the victims are, after all, the inhabitants of Israel today, including the self-righteous territories, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
This is what I want to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who, above all, has served 95 years of lasting tension (counting from Balfour's declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of the Middle East country.
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts some of them are derived from my own understanding of who virtually which group of people is the main driver of modern history events.
Human history is primarily a history of power struggle.
In every era, we can track down a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether they were always these personalities who completely autonomously guided their actions or whether someone behind their throne was directing their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one who could be considered the head of the octopus (if anyone is still standing over them, but I do not rule it out) - the Rothschields.
It doesn't say much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased in the 1990s to stop linking its name with the high-crime acts in which it stood and which always meant for them the consolidation of power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where the shares in the central bank are not being fought or preparing wars (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the central bank status of Rothschield Bank of America, began spending his own (understanding government) money during the Civil War and was murdered in the theatre in 1865.
JFK began to spend his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed, was murdered in 1963, Member Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for launching the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led from 1859 to 1871 to formulate the plan of the three world wars by the masonry of the highest, 33rd degree of dedication to Albert Pike.
The first war had the task of removing the great monarchist state units in Europe, the second one was to remove the colonial rule, especially the Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (this amount of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and do not consume so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than a prerequisite for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families headed by Rothschieldy is working is to create a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, so that the crisis does not repeat itself as the one that was triggered in 1907).
So, after they succeeded in murdering the Habs heir to the R-U throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to start World War I, they destroyed Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly, militaryly and economically unfounded, by surrendering Germany (there was no longer a need for war for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and then there was a fragmentation of Central European power, Austria Uhersko.
For the easier start of World War II, political bankers had let the political bankers create a lateral conflict by imposing a massive war reparation on Germany, creating a presupposition for radicalisation of the poor masses, and then just enough to give the Germans a strong enough culprit, the culprits of the culprit and the simple solutions offering the Leader and the creation of multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also played, the function of the fifth column, in the lighting of the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields encouraged the establishment of the Zionist movement, whose branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as the capital city (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks were taking place on both sides.
The second world war broke out, whether Hitler had ripped off the chain that was initially held by international bankers, or all he had done was difficult to estimate, in any event, the suffering of European Jews in concentrations created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, like the German War Reparations, the Second World War, the declaration of the State of Israel created the outbreak of the Third War.
If the international bankers manage to launch it, the Jewish nation, as in the latter, will be victims in the first line of battle, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country but also on an international scale (let's just assume how hard people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit, and who is the victim in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in the endless chain of violence, when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power at the beginning of all?
Here we need to distinguish the simple peoples of Israel from their leaders, because, as with us, international bankers are giving people a choice in elections exclusively to their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Netanyahu Hawk, is a typical example of a fascist, to international bankers of loyalty, a policy that does everything in its power to start a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in Shanghai's Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to grow into a global conflict and, given the control of Iran over the Górmuz Canal, which travels 20% of all world oil (the cruise corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to destroy the world economy.
In what light the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994 appear now: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in their image is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes it a totally controlled being.
"And forcing all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of her name.
That's what you need to understand: who has the sense to add the number of the beast.
This number marks a human being, and it's number six hundred and sixty-six."
Film Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, the crowd occupied the demonstrationist Islamic students of the American Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown shaman Mohammed Réza Páhlaví, who fled to the United States after the revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer a positive exit - it could not afford to throw the shawl overboard because it would substantially jeopardise the trust of allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the fiasco of trying to free the hostages by force.
The prisoners were finally released after 444 days after the negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their role at home caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debate in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's loss with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the history that brought America a minor victory.
Six employees fled from the embassy just before the embassy was taken.
After complicated peripeties, they ended up in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helping an extravagant cover story - they went to Canada's passports as members of the film crew, who watched the country's science fiction film location.
A combination of genres
A plan that an expert on "exfiltrace" by Tony Mendez required Hollywood cooperation.
To make the legend credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, there were press conferences, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been classified for a long time, the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of more genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, at the same time a "caper movie", a story of a successful piece of cake - an example of Danny's partner series.
In the film, moods are changing - on the one hand, the documentaryly conceived sequence from Tehran (the headline sequence shows the iconic contemporary photographs of events and the way in which the same situation was shown in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, light passages from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and mild exaggeration.
And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits are taking apart the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed his career restart in a remarkable way.
He became a respected director of the mocked actor and even his acting stopped being the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Affleck film that doesn't take place in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics of the director’s older films that promoted the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is also showing it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in reconstructing real events - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time mediates the emotions of confusion and unforeseeableness that occur when history is moved away from nowhere.
Affleck and his coworkers achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (false crew at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many stories in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not offer much in the film sense of exciting scenes.
He's been working quite successfully with it, sometimes he thinks something about reality - everything doesn't come out so elegantly there (the scene in which the imminent crisis at Tehran airport turns the phone call in America and the ranch chase seems to be far too far drawn to the hair).
But Arga’s weakness is the agitation resulting from the need to show too many stories in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood coworkers, but their characters would deserve more space and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film is kind of losing its dramatic move, it's a picture that can be watched with a mild interest, appreciated by the realization of even retro style evoking thrillery of the 70s.
It's hard to break.
As a reminder of a certain way of living history and proof of how exaggerated the ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The www.bankovnicharges.com server, which announces the most absurd bank fee annually, has now decided to launch a competition for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We were led by the last event where the EU is planning to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance rates for men and women is a recent decision.
So far, women have been favoured at life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory incorporation of biofuels into fuel, which, as a result of the damage to nature, also a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of hen cages, which made it very expensive this year.
The criticism had previously been faced with a de facto ban on the use of the term anointed butter or the elimination of classic light bulbs from the sale.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters
The EU's apparatus often decides under the pressure of either the commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic is now also a threat to its banks' demands).
The interests of the lobby were also in favour of the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and were not allowed to show "anomalous curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission has defended itself by harmonising the current divergent national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU standards on fruit and vegetables have already softened, despite the opposition of some states, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
The EU regulation last year may also be a candidate for winning the poll, according to which the balloons sold must be required to warn that children under 8 years of age must not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has referred here to American research, according to which balloons among toys are the leading cause of the death of children asphyxiated.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age when blowing into the pilgrimage frecks.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd - anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the topic to Greece and must instead speak about FYROM (Former Yugoslavia of Macedonia).
The Bank Fees Server.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, has nominated for a survey, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities, for example the EU Regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set maximum levels of food stocks that could be found in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the established volumes in preserved mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a high fine.
The survey organizers also took the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea and the idea of granting subsidies on request.
However, these ideas did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we do not have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said the Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he claimed that we had a lot of grain and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, he was to become full of warehouses, which he had to export.
The EU, according to Palas, was to pay us hundreds of millions of euros for the Czech Republic's move towards ports.
The European Commission finally came out of the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant subsidy was offered to the municipality’s Ministry for Local Development, led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), in particular they should have gone to write an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are an exception
While the regulation in the Member States is an easy target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, the more efficient functioning and development of the Union as a whole deserve recognition, according to a number of experts.
The more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, drawing on EU subsidies for projects that have no indication of an increase in European integration, but which Member States have forced in budget negotiations.
The emotions between the Czechs also drive the Czech Republic to fight for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products in Brussels, and they do not always succeed in this match.
After a six-year fight with the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs defended the designation of the Olomoucn shapes, but the domestic rum, the tradition of which dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed the native producers.
The names of rum can only be carried by products of cane distillate, not by sugar beet.
In the official list of EU registered products, the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parm hams have already found, for example, the Karlovy Vary biscuits, the mountainous and the spawning carp and the Žatek hops.
The EU trade mark can then also be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the burning pipes.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how do you think he wants to run for president?
It's not my business to be a senator or a president.
If it works in our country without a problem, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can't watch the last 20 years of the country breaking out, the thieves running around, people getting higher taxes, and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to figure out a way to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent non-participating officer, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but you went to the Castle early.
Aren't you going to turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to go to the castle fight according to the outcome in the Senate elections.
I later specified that if I were elected Senator, I would run for president.
My goal, however, is not a function, a function is a tool as I can make my visions happen.
That's why I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
But the problem is not only that as a nation we swear in pubs and on television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
This is accompanied by media that dehonest a person and confuses the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
I may have been claimed to be paying for journalists or counseling George Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You went to the fight for the Castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and returnable property over 20 million.
You have to change the law to do that.
As president, however, you do not have the authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How are you going to solve this?
When I lobbyed as a citizen to keep the guide business free, it was possible to enforce it.
The problem is politics - if someone comes up with a good left or right proposal, they reject it on purpose, and it stalls the citizens.
As an independent non-party, I have much more potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without the party's stamping and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country, on each side, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing man or a left-wing man?
From the Czech perspective, it seems to me that people rank me more to the left.
It's not important to me if it's a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any good solution publicly, even if it is proposed by the CRS or the ODS, and I will also be against the bad idea.
You make fun of someone saying you're a populist.
But you can't prove it by what you said?
When you're making a business plan in the company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, all you'll have is passwords.
And that's not enough politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, that you will manage to enforce criminal and material responsibilities?
I don't have a choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists, and the public, and trying to get them on their side, so that we can enforce it.
If I were elected president, it is not difficult to hold a television broadcast, where I ask the President of the Parliament to enact a substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell us why they don't want it.
If there is a strong personality that will name the vultures, you can press on the political scene.
Take the President's direct choice, that was due to public pressure.
As a matter of fact, I'm an amateur, not even a genius, not an intellectual.
I'm trying to find an ally for my opinions and visions.
I've only just started in politics, and I'm going to try and get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things myself, if it doesn't work out, I'll be done in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not gonna do anything in one person, so I've been going around a lot of people I know, see if they're running for Senate.
I went to Radim Jančura, who refused to do the job because of the amount of work.
So, at least I supported an investigative journalist named Jana Lorenc, who's been covering scams with light heating oils.
I ran for the fact that people are really unhappy, but now I'm in a hurry.
Sixty percent of the people did not make the election, and those who went were usually elected as representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
People have elected the Senate to enforce the changes difficult.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or chiefs.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven't considered it yet, because I don't have time to check every potential party's clear past, and I don't even have the money to do it.
I don't have the money for the presidential campaign. There's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
Private property, I'm guessing, is about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property for about 25 million, a ten million-dollar apartment, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, he was gallant to women and at the same time he fought against bad and bad.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have 60 million worth of property, and you don't have the campaign money?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it much.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million to campaign.
Do you want me to indebte myself?
I've already hit 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that I don't think I'm that interested in my program.
And I have no obligation to campaign to pay from my own.
The campaign costs will basically cover what kind of senator's salary I'm going to get.
But I wouldn't survive from it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just want to make money, I don't run.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd turn these activities down?
But that's not about the salary.
As promised, I've partially quenched my activities.
For example, the travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much did you, as a businessman, get used to taking a month?
Two hundred to four hundred, which I take further.
And if I were president, I would end my business.
You can find the full interview in the rights issue on Saturday.
The MVRDV architects show that real adventures do not take place only in the head - for example Spicenisse and recently built Mountain books - 2 images
"The building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic. Finally, there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, who is walking around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, the IT technician at the nearby big business, means, "Well, the house is nice."
But I ask what else we need a library for today.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
None of these old-style libraries are voluntarily going to any of these libraries today, are they?
Spickenisse, a settlement close to Rotterdam without its own jobs, which is not worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago a decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
However, the success of the educational offensive was not alarming.
And so the city councillors learned that there is only one way to become statistics masters: we must have a library!
Wines Maas from the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, a master of madly brave column charts and a builder of funny, often cynical buildings, accepted the thing with the usual calmness and appeared at the competition meeting in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the commission was still looking over and shrugging its shoulders, the brazen Maas put his gifts on himself by size and ended his activistically justified speech with the words "Dear Township!"
So this is my suggestion on the Mountain of Books in Spienisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain for EUR 30 million was finished.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town grey, which has not yet been able to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, for which you would rather expect a dairy, is thanks to it a little richer contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spickenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
Long Path to the Book
First impression: reading eldorado under a cheese hatch.
The lift rides through the massif of the mountain, but you will find real spatial and reading passions when you walk through topography.
On all sides, the glass interior is bright and clear, the floor made of a burnt convertible and the elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally standing shelvings with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is mostly inconvenient and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and moved the reader's space from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is skillfully used: in the middle there are offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and home technology headquarters.
The special comfort is black shelves for books, which are one wall covering, one window sill and another by railing the stairs.
Apparently, the structure and smell are foreign.
Even sworn architects and build engineers twist their heads over the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project leader in Spipikenisse, on a request from Standard magazine.
And so, one day on a French farm, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, it has been used as a base under the roots of a millimetre thread made of synthetic matter.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
The thin fabric lasts one, two seasons, and then it's ripe to be thrown into the bulky waste.
For the library, the curtain - for the first time in such a quantity - was pressed on the boards with a thickness of four centimeters.
The action of heat and pressure is the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) in dark, homogeneous and loadable material, which smells a little bit like a new car and a little bit like sports shoes.
Up 105 stairs, you get to the top.
At the end of almost 500 metres long travelling you will be rewarded not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and figs in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but especially about the proper humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You might not believe this, but this house is, despite many glass surfaces, a demonstration project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It heats up and cools with the Earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass hatch, the sun shines inside for a short time, even in sunny days.
The wide glued wooden ligament, which stands perpendicular to the glass facade, serves as a shattering and capture of a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be handled by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an early IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls Boekenberg "a long-awaited soul" Spicenisse.
Reason: Every citizen of the city was invited to open up a book from his personal fund a few weeks ago.
First, the optical gaps in the library, not yet fully equipped, now containing 70,000 pieces, were to be filled.
The concept has proven itself.
The police are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, everyone has a relationship with the new house now.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
The MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which is called the formation of an identity in a professional jargon.
Spikenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he may be.
That's finally the starting point for identity.
Shabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting on the adoption of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Stephen Szabo, Berlin is now balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first indicated that it would vote against the proposal for a Palestinian observation status in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, of course, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's going to support an American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
Germany also abstained during the insurrection in Libya in March 2011 when it came to the establishment of a no-fly zone.
That's what NATO finally enforced.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that he is changing his foreign policy right now, from a policy that was so-called the US-led to a German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still settling in, but they're on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy they have in France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It shows its readiness to take on national interests as well as positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to some extent different from those of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has a large outlet in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Gulf of Persia.
Therefore, it must be careful not to discourage the public, but the elites in Arab countries.
Anyway, that plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to add too much importance to it, it's not exactly a one-sided relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany harm its relations with the US when Germany abstained from voting in the case of both important decisions, for example when voting on Palestine?
I think that there is a great deal of understanding in Europe and even in the US for the German attitude.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as that of Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even benefit from some respect.
This indicates that it must be regarded as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., on the other hand, made it clear to the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal policy.
I think Obama's government may have a considerable understanding of the European position secretly.
But, as a result of the political situation there, this position cannot, of course, be held public.
I think the differences in opinion are not really as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very excited about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it not difficult for Germany to bring its close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other hand?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
They cannot therefore be part of a wider line and must instead move things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany because of its relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does it even want to take the lead?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, whenever Germany adopts a bigger role, anti-German moods arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable for all the neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now constantly falling, but the EU is currently failing to meet this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and they'll make it even more popular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this lies a label that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, he enjoys protection as long as they are not sued by actual brand owners.
And even then, it's not clear whether they're gonna live up to the law.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in violating protection rights in the Far East.
A new case lands on my desk every week.
Forgers will need a few extra letters to sign up for their brands.
For example, Gucci will become Lu-Gucci and instead Prada will have Prada-Kny registered.
In this way German companies are legally copied, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens up the agenda with the record of the Beijing Stamp Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had Zegna DF Puma protect its trademark. An artificial name that parasites also on the fashion house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several storehouses where counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different, and his mandate against the Chinese companies receiving from the stamp office a completely official right to use a label that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," an associated brand.
This word focuses on Bang Dakuan.
That means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's damaging business, we have to fight it," he calls on Pattloch.
"The mark will be diluted, the exclusive position will disappear, the image damage will be enormous."
The financial losses and judicial costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially in the case of expensive sample products.
According to information from the CLSA market research company, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the market that is growing fastest.
However, the deletion of doubtful records in the brand register can be difficult to achieve and it costs something.
The procedure can last for up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch talks about cases where the court rejected the action because the name of the infringement became a 'market reality' after a long period of time.
When the plaintiff has bad luck, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's the law of the jungle.
Known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of the Sana construction machinery, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer of pumps for the Putzmeister concrete mixture.
Therefore, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought the Volvo, originally used a blue logo that resembled the BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Lacoste's manufacturer of fashion goods lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the C.T.O.O. admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few employees and space.
But last year, it was reported that "the course of the work process returned from an emergency to normal".
For example, the number of pending objections proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
57 000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 complaints are still pending at the office.
It's expensive to do something about it.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million brand protection applications, almost a third more than 2010.
That's the record, and that means that China's ten-year-old is keeping a list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of valid brands - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were selected on the fees.
This simply means that every login on average costs 1280 Yuan, or 160 euros.
The dispute is multiple, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
The Germans have achieved the abolition of its illegal production of fake car parts.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would have forgotten that, since the surname cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanna Wentzler, Chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The stamp office of the CTMO also rejected the objection of the Munich company.
Although Freudenberg has achieved rights in two further instances, the opponents still fight in the dispute.
You have to be very careful.
Now the matter is being discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good ending and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says, "The management is extremely expensive and it costs us a lot of time, money, and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company's archive, they even had to review a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg in vain offered "a high six-digit amount in euro" to settle the dispute.
"That's what it means to us," says Wentzler.
Europe is threatened with danger from the Far East.
And that's in case the imitators get unprotected tags there.
For example, one Chinese producer wanted to apply in Germany to the term Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This area of business long ago gave up, yet managed to reverse registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international stamping rights. Foreigners should rather "anything worth protecting, even in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg, in the last act of its drama, is subject to the brand, then the counterparty will probably have to pay the licence fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed off the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS day: stabbing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Congregation - and in Swaziland, the orphans are happy to have died of AIDS.
A story of a connection that goes far more than 8,733 kilometers.
First there is a stabbing: cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's moccasins are looking for a tact on the dance floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly come up - urge, mothers and chase each other.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopfa almost lifts it from his textile shoes when he connects voices with wild gestures.
In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is trying a new song.
50 singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a researcher of human genetics to a householder.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every choir voice has a different text and in a very foreign language - a zulu spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in Swaziland.
Self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS eradication program, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of which 23.5 million lives in South Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland after their parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after their parents died of AIDS, Esitjeni found the Society of Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend a second grade school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, the patronage can be taken over.
Guarantees the child a school uniform and one hot meal a day at the Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means "teller of stories" or "one who praises" in the language of zulu.
No one can speak in this space with a liquid bantage, just singing.
For almost ten years now, the choir has been practicing songs in this soft talk and sometimes brings them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
At 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, there is a village of Esitjeni in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of Swaziland, which depends on the power of the voices of the German congregation.
Forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay or straw huts, many of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have been subjected to HIV.
In Esitjeni, you can see in the small amount of the whole of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy expected worldwide according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male foreskin, which is demonstrably reducing the risk of a disease by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carry a virus of weakened immunity, and there is no rare fact that they die in less than 30 years.
This village was discovered by the Congregation on a trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. First of all, members of Imbongi saw many children in the streets missing not only parental care, but clean everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school education, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
At first, it was a private deployment of individuals, which allowed for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him one warm meal a day.
However, a year later, a congregation of "Voices for Africa" has been established, which has since taken care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI includes syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The common viral SPI are HIV, human papillomavirus, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
The munitions and vultures are part of the parasite's SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
Roberta Kochan's Constitution is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in our population, but about 20 percent of the newly infected HIV population is this group.
Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, there are often human papillomaviruses among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to the Institute of Robert Koch, the number of syphilis infected with the disease in 2001 was more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than a year before.
What symptoms point to sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the area of genitals, difficulty in urination, discharge, abdominal pain, or blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and will therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
The risk of infections may reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
For sexual communicable agents can also be partially passed on by infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in case of frequent rotation of sexual partners.
In the event of early diagnosis, the majority of the SPI can be cured and the subsequent consequences prevented.
Thanks to the patronage, the charitable gifts and, last but not least, the rewards that the congregation earns by singing all over Germany, some money will be collected.
"We have already sent about EUR 200 000 to Esitjeni," says the chairman of the Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Domini, a confident woman who can enforce himself.
It also ensures that orphan children find shelters, such as some of their grandmothers.
Gogo, as in the language of the zulu, is called old women, they support the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, put a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children showed up every day in their uniforms at school.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" founded a sewing school, built two hens, and together with an American health organization made sure that many people in the village had had an HIV test.
Even though the disease in the whole country is so obvious, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because he has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, quite strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king of Mswati III, is known for its immodest lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life is also responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, but nobody uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
To support cultural exchange, the Imbongi congregation travels once every two, three years together in the south of Africa and sings songs full of grief, combat, confidence in the future and confidence of the black, which many in the southern tip of the Black Continent know from the apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the speech of blacks - such appreciation not only brings the mood and joy, but also has shed tears in many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children with a patronage.
Even though you can hardly find this village on the maps, there is more than a known valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," people say.
And if you go back to Heidelberg, which is 8,733 kilometers from here, to the ass-wrenching singers at the Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light is on here.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there was ice on planet Mercury.
The ice cover could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even though it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as is apparent from three studies published on Thursday by the specialist magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that an ice cover exists in the area of this planet, which lies in permanent shade.
It's supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even up to 20 meters strong.
This water apparently came from comets or perhaps even asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let's not put ice in the context of the existence of life on this planet, said the head of scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Fahrenheit.
However, findings could help us to clarify how water and other essential elements of life have entered other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix, undetected Earthmen, are involved in the exploration of the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, small windows to endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides Dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who is circling the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new concept of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, worse identifiable are the pink-colored "novorosenata" in the obstetric hall of the stars.
This area, where stars are formed - scientists call it unromantically W5 - discovered the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia in 6,500 light years.
This changing heat of dying stars has picked up the Spitzer NASA telescope.
The doodle ring consists of material that the star splattered during the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid nebula, which is 5400 light years away from Earth, new stars are formed from the gas and dust.
Photographs of the galaxy's "rolls" were taken by the NASA's Spitzer telescope.
Starship Pleiade, also called "Seven Sisters", is visible at night with the naked eye.
But thanks to the telescope, they'll be better off with paint.
The Helix nebula may appear like a red eye on this infrared image.
It is located within 700 light years from the constellations of the Waterman.
Her resemblance with the Earth's continent has led to this nebula's name North America.
The combination of a normal and infrared photograph is a source of extraordinary colouring.
This "baby" among the stars managed to eat in full beauty until the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: how they came into existence is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps these are the remains of Saturn's moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest pictures of the Hubble telescope: the vortex galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloration, become real works of art.
The take, published by the European Southern Observatory, depicts a few thousand light-years away from the Trifid nebula in the constellation Střelka.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, trikane), because the dark stripes of dust divide the burning heart of this star hospital into three parts.
In the constellation Hadonosh, astronomers photographed the foresight of the cosmic collision: in the distance of 400 million light years from Earth, the core of the two colliding galaxies is a woman, and there must inevitably be a collision.
This birth of the star was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical shortcuts can call it the South Winder.
The photograph from Hubble's telescope shows the cutting of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cefea.
This 1400 light years distant nebula consists of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual home dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It displays a ring from black holes, which is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC scientists 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to ever-increasing new growths.
Also, these star clouds, associated with Rosette's nebula, are still giving birth to new young stars, 5,000 light years away from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was only shortly after the Big Bang when there was mostly hydrogen in the whole universe.
Our views into the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo, he used it to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been growing ever greater - and the views they mediate are getting deeper and deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was 5 meters in diameter.
Large Binocular Telescope stands in Arizona.
It allows you to look into the universe using two mirrors, each of which is 8.4 meters in diameter.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet, its average is approximately 11 metres.
The disadvantage of the cheap construction method: the telescope is provided by a handlebar at a height angle, which reduces its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed at a height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high enhancement of the light flow.
Despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, this is equal to the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecib (Port Rico), scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any owner of the computer that will make it available its computing performance.
A look at the observer of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Andes of Chile.
Very Large Telescope stands here, and he's honoring his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned at the ESO's Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror has a full 42 meters and has to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be calculated first in 2018.
The two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of 10 meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks into the universe with the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea there is to be a new giant telescope - with a 30-meter mirror diameter.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
But the most significant impressions of the universe are from Hubble’s cosmic telescope.
From April 24, 1990, it has been giving us the pick-up of distant worlds.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching since March 2009 for extrasolar planets - especially those that are inhabited.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The picture documents the final preparations before launching the Kepler space telescope.
The space telescope of James Webb (JWST) will first be launched into space on board the Ariane rocket in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope is 6,5 meters in diameter.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe there's ice on the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messenger is circling this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have been showing for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004, and the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter daily and you will live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many will live to see the Bible’s age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Finding traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many will live to see the Bible’s age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Finding traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
I'm going to go up Talyš and we can call it wildly romantic.
The minibus runs along the road with many turns along densely wooded hills, predatory rivers and simple peasant buildings.
Everything's green and juicy, almost seems to be in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the outermost south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here lives the caucasian ethnic group of Talishes, of which it is not very well known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and live very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come here. It's not easy to come from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-speed.
The fairy tale wealth the country owes to the Naphthah in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the country.
But Pilate Fatulajevo (48) is convinced that Lerik has the right to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Eurovision Prize in May - and next year we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulajeva says.
She's the director of the longevity museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of almost eight dozen Talishes from the surrounding area who are a hundred years older. Fatulajeva shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
At 136, he still had a child.
However, the common star of this museum is the herd of the îirali Müslümov sheep, who was supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person with the documents was 122 years old, it seems that the age of Müslümov was extremely dubious.
"He was born in this area of 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulajeva.
This man was supposed to have been married three times and had 23 children.
So, at his age, was he wrong about a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, the gerontologist of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
"In some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, perhaps many people of high age live," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when the matrix is missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
However, the fact is that people around Lerik often experience the Bible’s age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why, then, do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijan’s guide to Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talishes.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatuljevo Museum believes that it is in nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of Talyshes, who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem to be credible from a Bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He's sitting on the ground with a butterscotch he's untiring.
Under one roof, there are eight people, including one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
There's two little kids jumping around.
The kitchen prepares tea for guests, which is served in typical abdominal "armada" glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are a perfect line, and under the scarf she hides long, dark blonde copies, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't look like it and it kept the color.
"I've never used shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough
She always ate what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was World War II.
But everything got better when Gejdar Aliyev took over the oar.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is done around the figure of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, does not know the limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then took over the oar of his son Ilham.
At least old people in Azerbaijan don't suffer from need.
Mirzayeva receives a pension of 230 manats each month (approximately the same amount in euros).
And perhaps the grayish son of Mirzayev may be right: "Old people enjoy great respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
If it's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The disintegrated demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the deep dissolution of the earth.
The future constitution based on the right of Sharia is being debated.
The President of Egypt did not spare a path.
We need to create a transition.
"And for our success, I am responsible, in front of people and in front of God," he said on national television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but above all to Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, so far hopelessly debated in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "godly state" on the Nile at the mercy of the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi said almost apologizing that he temporarily limited the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and extended his own to "save the revolution".
But what a 61 - year - old engineer who has the title of a doctor at the U.S. University in Southern California really wants to save, neither the Egyptians nor the world are clear about that.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
The 234 paragraphs, which were approved by the centenary Constitutional Assembly with the predominance of Islamists in the 15-hour nocturnal marathon, partly raise concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and one can fear that Islamists will use this vague wording and the related legal free space for a more stringent interpretation of the Sharia.
At the very least, this is explained by the new paragraph added: In all matters relating to the Sharia, we need to consult the university of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the whole of Sunni Islam.
It may not be, but it may mean that the cleric will exercise supervision of the legislation, which would bring about the actual withdrawal of the law.
There are many interpretations in the draft Constitution
The problem is also that civil jurisdiction of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubarak's governments to suppress the opposition.
After the dictatorship fell, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As it stands in the proposal, the state should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morale and values".
This is legally formulated in such a way that, through this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In an understandable language, it means nothing but censorship.
Moreover, no paragraph in writing defines the explicit equality of men and women.
Another paragraph prohibits the dishonoring or slandering of the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
However, it remains unclear what shame is and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally doubtful is the wording that is prohibited from "discriminate people".
In this case, is the cartoon of the President or a joke on the account of legal experts enough?
The issue of interpretation, like much more in this proposal, which Mursí will submit for signature and, in his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of popular vote.
"The revolution has returned"
For several weeks now, the opposition has been formed against the excesses of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it started to pay.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbahí, who placed third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize laureate and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed Baradej, stated that the proposal of the Constitution belongs "to a junkyard of history".
Through the service of short messages, Twitter accused Mursi's supporters that they wanted to do "outside democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said the opposition member Jasir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished," the Egyptian media quoted opposition policy of Chalid Ali.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood has declared naturalism, but with caution not on Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile outside Cairo University.
She was attended by many women who were covered up and supporters of the Salaphis who called, "The people demand the law of God."
They asked Mursi: "Put the earth clean!" and assured them: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over Tahrir’s symbolic square, where everything began, would probably trigger a state of civil war.
Mursi's supporters obviously didn't want to take any chances.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the opposers and supporters of the draft constitution had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now it's time to let the people at the polls decide which direction the country should go.
Indeed, most are considered in favour of the proposal of Islamists.
"The word 'human rights' doesn't happen once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, enrolls Háfize Abu Sa'du.
Eighty-four-year-old human rights defender and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court for Mubarak.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For that he was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution, the words 'human rights' are not even once,' he complains in an interview for 'Welt am Sonntag'.
Mursi's power expansion to all three power forces in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"In fact, instead of strengthening civil society, the president really cancelled it," Sa'da complains.
However, without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned and international community watching the match of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could get back at him.
The demonstrator at Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
The most stinking fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the mystery of the country's success be associated with a local appetite for an extremely smelly fish?
Take some overripe cheese.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let it lie down for a week.
That's how you get the sense of paralyzing the smell of a cancer, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and in the air there is a ubiquitous smell.
Cancer is a salted trout acidified in water for up to one year - depending on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and gets cold, the Norwegians are beginning to meet here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, as to how to say it best, the most captivating food.
"You will eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of water," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rafisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat little dice of fish and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer Aquatite rather than Cancer," says Havard.
A drink can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's a similar piece of sushi that was on the long way by bus.
Cancer is a product of a very different time when poverty was in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators, fish were soaked in airtight barrels with water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses were no doubt dulled with alcohol.
Before only one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for a job, most of which emigrated to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of which are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings and a large-scale care system.
Residents of Sweden, an old rival, who was even richer than Norway a few days ago, flow into the country for work.
The cancer is seen as something important, indispensable, even though a relatively stinking part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 dollars) a piece.
Norway often does not get into global reports - and it seems that this is what most people do.
The name Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with reluctance.
Instead, the shooting is called "the 22nd July event".
Norms can only find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Under the present wealth of Norway lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who, with his long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes, represents a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We're, as you say, considerate people.
Her English, as well as the English of most of the people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don't show off, we don't like showtime.
Norway is very careful about its oil wealth - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to a global financial meltdown was throwing money they didn't have, the Norwegians had strings tightly tightened on their body.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eating a coffin," he adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in front of something to eat - I've had enough of the cancer.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else, and it's beautifully juicy.
But tonight is the stinking fish again.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where the cancer is served for dinner and where the guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They have a connection to a live television broadcast in which the host is surrounded by a butterfly plate with a coffin.
It's like a Eurovision singing competition.
"What's your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
Applause and laughter are echoed.
A man will fall out of a chair, possibly made of water.
Or maybe fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As the emerging Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant from the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is blocked even in the best of times, steel barriers were built, closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent those arriving from getting into work, but to prevent those protesting in access to Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sword and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a challenging challenge.
At the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has done well economically, but the country is in the clutches of the drug war, which has already been estimated to have been the victim of 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said President Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the US president, President Pen Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state, Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital city.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him well.
Citizens assign him the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new motorways Pena Nieto had built. These motorways are a huge improvement compared to the holes and bumpy roads that used to be here.
Boards with its name also hang on the walls of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with the topic of climate change.
"We expect a real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a State Member on the side of President Pen Niet, the Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope for the interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country so necessarily needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI side was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Mr Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, many are expected to be inside the Enriqua Pena Nieta.
And he refuses to express his opposition characterizing a new president as a man without substantial content.
He's a very straightforward man, very interested in having an excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great statesman, and he's a man who listens.
But on the other hand, this is not an impression that many people have from their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Stuck under the motorway overpasses in many places, it reminds us of the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help manage drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, especially the violence against women.
Only in the last two years have the bodies of dozens of murdered women been dumped in empty places next to a huge landfill.
At a time when Pena Nieto was governor, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, the critics of Pena Nieta say that he failed to handle women's murder in his office.
And in a worse case, his leadership is accused of closing their eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of the degenerate neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses her crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like her body was washed," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of blows and the postmortem stiffness began.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were told.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker and a whisker.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there are so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
The Sherpa that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
Over the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime, and the new president has promised that for the duration of his service they will be his priority.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was," says MP PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that's exactly what the families of victims in Ciudad don't fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about mistreatment, claims the military prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney is attempting to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of gross custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the basis of gross treatment of Manning in prison.
Private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The U.S. Attorney is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest leak of classified material in the history of the U.S., has missed many opportunities to complain about the gross treatment allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor, Maj. Ashden Fein, during the cross-examination of Private Manning at the preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the weekly visits that Manning had with the unit officers during the nine months of their custody in Quantico, Virginia did not show any complaints about mistreatment.
The cross-examination which took place during the hearing on the defence's motion to reject the case against Manning due to the gross treatment at the time of the detention, which is sufficient in itself, took place the day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in custody.
Army Intelligence Analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning was the source of her information.
At the hearing on Friday, U.S. Attorney Fein, together with Manning, received forms from the officers after meeting Manning at the Quantico Prison, where he was held in the regime with increased security from July 2010 to April 2011.
The Officers of Manning were asking questions and recording his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday about these forms, Manning admitted that the treatment of his guards regarded him as "excellent" and considered the overall treatment of the facility as "very professional".
Forms show no complaints about mistreatment, even though Officer Manning's officers directly asked how he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he expressed concern about the various problems orally and that the officers who had visited him spoke to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them but did not notice these problems.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after they discussed concerns), and that did not necessarily mean that I did not mention them," said Manning.
Judge Fr Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his person's treatment in January 2011 when he met with a committee assessing the suicidal thoughts he had expressed several months earlier in the form.
Manning responded that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction of the "harm prevention" regime.
The army stated that it used this restrictive regime (one degree under the surveillance regime due to suicide) to protect and protect others.
"I wanted the prisoners in custody to know that I was fine and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life, as I saw it," said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday to his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait where he was held almost two months before he was transported to the custody prison at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait, and one day he passed out because of heat.
He stated that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very depressing.
"My world has only sprung to the base of Arifjan, to the cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantica he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he only had one mattress, a blanket, a navel, some clothes and glasses allowed.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against the rules during the day.
Manning said he always slept with the light on the outside of his cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards couldn't see his face, when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint on the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he made on Thursday’s statement regarding the fact that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners at the morning count.
Manning said he wasn't allowed to hide his blanket when he was counting.
On Friday's interview conducted by Judge Manning, he stated that by order of his guards he had determined that he had a blanket that he could cover himself, but admitted that no one had given him an order to postpone it.
Thursday Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer you're not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a belt from his underwear or his navels to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that that night his underwear, his navels and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that, in the event of his conviction before a military court, the beginning of which is expected at the beginning of next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense stated that she was planning to plead guilty in lower crimes and that she would fight against other charges because they were too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon has made a statement that Manning has been held in accordance with the rules on all arrests held in custody with maximum security.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegal disclosure of intelligence documents on the Internet, transmission of information on national security and theft of public property or records.
If he's charged at all points, he could be sentenced to life sentence.
My crisis of Mexican-American identities
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of difficult times, they say.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely made it through the crowd and arrived in space for the immigration agenda, where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Citizens").
I was standing there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called "Mexico" my whole life.
It's an ethnic shortcut, like when my friends in Boston call themselves "Ira" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy."
So later I ended up with the term "Mexico American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need to use a shortcut.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I cannot get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled my American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House this week.
They had usual issues on the agenda, which are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why there is the same probability that Mexicans will remain in Mexico as they will travel to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a trading block in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against the drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, a relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite half the Mexican territory into the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the range of centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.
So one minute after a U.S. representative says something a little bit critical about Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans interfere with the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will step on the path of war.
And yet Mexico's real challenge is to relate more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparents who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, weak education, origin from the poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we're living an American dream now, we go to good schools, and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live an American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
He's against the United States.
Besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of defeat and view us as a inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bonds to Mexico never strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is only about failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they'd never have left.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who had been legally travelling to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand who they are and Mexican Americans hate it.
Even though she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like they're part of either one.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have the roots in either one.
In Mexico, he looks at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and press on political leaders to strengthen their relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
Fair enough.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the way they treated Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel unvoiced about the way their family members have been treated in a much closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The cessation of fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that every one of these things is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary conjectures about who started it, many buildings were transformed into ruins, killed by more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring changed the old order and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the future chaos in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight even more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to believe that this may interrupt their fatal stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first sight, there seems to be no reason for this at present.
Even if the ceasefire of 21 November lasted, the battles of this week strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazan inhabitants in one of the most regrettable and populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by its enraged rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas can very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world gained greater influence, making Hamas powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a renewed regional power, once the nearest Muslim ally of Israel, has joined Hamas, and so has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The exaltation of Hamas says that the Islamic half-month is encircling around Israel, north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah's party/mile rule, across Syria, where the rebels who are increasingly leaning towards Islamism can take down Bashar Assad, all the way to Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the King.
And above all, on the south wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, far from the most populous and crucial Arab country, balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be ruled out by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel’s hardliners come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
The Israeli missile missile system The Iron dome proved its price and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology America is as unwavering as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the launch of the last round of violence.
And above all - Israel has flourished, especially under the direction of Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, who largely ignored the peace process.
Even though rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, they have been relatively calm in Israel from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what may be the Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality from international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party, Likud, joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the beginning of the campaign for the elections held on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they be launching rockets like their countrymen did in Gaza?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them with heads out.
Perhaps the hardliners will win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Even though Islamists who acquire power in Egypt and other countries do not love Israel much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israeli defence spending is higher than the expenditure of all its four Arab neighbours combined.
Starting a new war with the local superpower will hardly help new Arab governments heal their economies.
The fact that President Mursi worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and may mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelis should also look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, denying the rights of Palestinians to self-determination barrels with gunpowder, which must erupt one day in the areas occupied by Israel - as well as the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Even now, repression is weakening in the Jewish state of democracy, and demography is making the situation worse as the Arab population grows.
The bloody outbursts against Gaza taking place every few years in order to repress Hamas will increasingly collect diplomatic taxes.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides proclaim, the majority of the outside world and the following newspapers: two states when Israel moves the territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping the fire will give pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to base itself on stopping arms supplies to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of part of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from the outside must also push for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table.
During his first term of office, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to enter the process.
That's patheticly shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in the stable Middle East.
This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws on ugly cigarette packaging have entered into force in Australia
A warning for smokers and sick parts of the body is displayed on the unsightly green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands.
The Australian laws on ugly packs of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, and logos and brand colors have replaced the general olive green boxes with disgusting pictures of the sick parts of the body and with images of children and newborns ill as a result of smoking their parents.
In addition to the various health warnings and images, the only difference between boxes are the names of brands that are printed in the same small font from Saturday.
This is the most stringent regime in the world regarding tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by removing this habit from its attraction.
It's based on studies that show that if people don't start smoking until they're 26 years old, there's a 99% chance they'll never start smoking.
"Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them together with their product," says the Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek and quotes studies that, for example, have shown that children combine the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry was hard lobbying against the introduction of these laws.
The tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade on the black market, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"Thanks to this legislation, there will be serious involuntary consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products that will be sold on the streets of Australia.
Others claim that the law has increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone cigarette packaging used to cover disgusting boxes two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals concerning the Australian Supreme Court laws from almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesale dealers and expected new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
As a possible setback, experts report the popularity of social media in the demographic group the plan is focused on.
Throughout a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most traders hide cigarettes from direct sight, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned internet advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space to promote your products, online space is an insurmountable place for you to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman has recorded an increase in brand ratings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honza".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and did his job and created this video, or is that what the marketing company is involved in?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it will deal with new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector has gone so far that it has paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the attack of the new rules - countries within the World Trade Organisation claim that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia are dealing significantly.
The implementation of the SOO Decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering more stringent laws.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
Images have no effect on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You just pull out your cigarette and stick the box back in," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photo of a tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason for me to stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that he's harder to balance into shelves thanks to his uniform boxes.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, "OK, that's it, we'll close the shop," he said, and he'll throw his hands away.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored.
The last Thanksgiving day I spent an unexpected five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention the hollow-free shops).
But some scientists and experts in child development are increasingly coming with the praise of boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It makes the brain go into interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And given that most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we have no chance of enjoying the boredom.
Should we encourage boredom, then?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a rather new phenomenon that occurred with more free time.
But, as Peter Toohey says, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompey there was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century C.E.
And then the question is how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at research literature and showing the idea of a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it".
The boredom differs from apathy by not being involved in anything, but by wanting to be.
He says there's no urge to do anything about apathy.
He says the core of boredom is "the disturbance of the attention process associated with the bad mood and feeling of the slow passing of time."
Boring can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship with each other, they tend to see boring people as a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble focusing.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape that the person had read an article in the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the television program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - had difficulty concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
When you are trying to focus on a difficult or enticing task, may disturb attention leading to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "like finding the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help you not to be bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and snooping, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more careful.
"The study shows that children who are allowed to drill will learn more and maintain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced boredom - the delay of my flight, the buzzing speaker, especially the long film.
But some individuals have a better chance of getting bored than others.
To help measure boredom scientists in the 1980s developed the "Strategy for Boreding" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions such as: "Many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous," and "I have so much interest that I don't have time to do all of them."
Using these scales scientists have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally insensitive.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found out that 32 percent of the teenagers said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, 3% of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he does not know whether the percentage expression of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "adultation is the ultimate time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boredom good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, to play gambling, or to abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Nuda is the way of the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will not only learn to entertain himself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't even be too critical of her.
Rather, our goal should be to make ourselves comfortable when we are from the reach of constant crushing of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain when the noise turns off."
There is no manual in Colorado on the new marijuana law
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a high school student and a South-East Colorado footballer, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for holding a few grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one day of September he drove with a couple of friends in Lamar on the plains near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr Orozco was sued for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offences for which there is USD 100 per fine - and he was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of minor drug cases depends on the spot rather than on the law.
Hundreds of offences for the possession of marijuana have already been lifted here and in the State of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police department stopped accusing adults at the age of 21 and older for holding a small quantity legally permitted after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado said they'd continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and they're still accusing people of being held.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver towards the western mountains vote to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their villages.
"This matter is evolving so fast that I do not know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Even the regulators in Washington are gossiping their heads.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sales - all by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is first before most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now also for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the State of Washington's State Alcohol Licence Board.
But as Mr. Smith has admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent for us to follow," he said.
The Washington Act, the so-called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but a legal hold yes.
And there are ingenious mechanical questions that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to balance the state directive on "corresponding access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trade within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"There will be no more difficulty in placing licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the Centre for Legal Hemp, a recently established research group.
On 21 November, police chief Oates sent an e-mail to his officers from Aurora, in which he announced that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute offences for holding a small amount of marijuana for every citizen of 21 years of age and that police "immediately" will stop the accusation of people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would enforce city laws governing the growers of medical marijuana and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mostly as a way of pushing users to seek treatment.
Currently, the charges of holding 56 grams or less are facing 119 people, although many are facing further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute a criminal offence which was a criminal offence at the time it occurred," said Mr Buck in his statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places like the village district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer accuses adults of holding a small amount.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to reject all pending cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of the Colorado voters supported the measures, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the counter-reactions across the state revealed, in view of this great state green experiment, a deep dissolution among local officials.
For district prosecutors it is a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendant in possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman of the National Organization for Law Reform on marijuana.
"They have spent so much of their lives suing people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first countries to approach a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on their best track to become national testing cases for the legalization of drugs.
The lawyers and the state authorities are planning new borders for legalized sales, and at the same time they are anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to regard the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The lawyers of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will submit.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana dealers and patients who used it, who attracted attention, the federal government mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and other 16 states in operation.
While drug agents probably won't knock out the door to catch a small bag of drugs, it's likely that they'll deny the possibility of state-regulatory marijuana business permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to President Obama's administration.
Several Colorado cities do not wait for federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments have approved moratoriums for any new marijuana business, even though it will take about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-year ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we issue someone's license and then we have a big federal business," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our municipality voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the village voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am conservative."
Only today's university students are being attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest knowledge headquarters, a modern-style greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the 1980s, I packed up my suitcases until two weeks after I entered Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, and crashed into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I gave up because I objected to loving students in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson strenuously declared that I had left because I was forced to drink from broken cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for one reason and, in this cradle of supposed enlightenment, it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I as a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask me why I'm bringing it up now.
It is simply because recent reports indicate that the new generation of students on the right of the center suffers from similar persecution.
The institutionalised and growing hatred for conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College (JCR) junior year association claim that because of their political views they are "insulated actively, exposed to personal attacks and are shown not to be welcome".
They call for a position on the University Committee on Equal Opportunities to ensure that they can share their views freely.
Their situation has not even helped the recently mentioned documentary television program BBC Two, called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, about the student political events that the conservative described as stranges and neo-Nazis.
A graduate of Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), was introduced to the show and dressed in a silver suit and had a silver-headed cane.
At other universities, conservative students say that because of the introduction of higher education, they are treated as "sacrifice lambs".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence on universities is increasing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
A 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the move for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unfortunate", while the 19-year-old elected president of Ouca Stephanie Cheril says that in the approach of JCR members to the right of the people, there has been a deterioration.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18-year-old and cripplingly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the most bitter.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse to give an honorary title to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in the funding of higher education.
Even Stalinists would be concerned about the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students are meeting with each other and with the professors, I got a taste of the pelyna that was supposed to come.
I found that not only do professors of silence approve the taunting of conservative pupils, but they also enjoy participating in them.
A policy of mining strike, privatisation and resistance to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was brought into the wood-covered auditoriums.
My first lecture was about translation of the 18th century French text into English and what followed, I was not ready.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was getting pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake dough, was very bile.
"Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were hibernating.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you're too busy with social matters," said Professor Pitt.
I've gone back to my room torn down.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight pat on my shoulder.
He was a second year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the Ouca.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone suspected of conservativeism is the target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative first-timers pretend to be Labourists.
Later in the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
A student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economics, who (an irony) went to Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
He beats each other up, doesn't he?
I felt how homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet people like that only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labourist and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years before me, they evolved as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who was based in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's advisor to foreign politics and one of the ones who wrote her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
That place hated for its prodigy and pettyness and for its tendency to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he joined the University of Bilkent in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started to drive from Oxford to my parents' house in London, looking for refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said Pathically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreams.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His wet eyes smiled.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience was getting worse.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, gave in to pressure and gave up his conviction.
The next week, during the course of teaching, when another professor of history in absolute seriousness declared that I was "the enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was blushing inside, I confessed that my parents had brainwashed me, and I called them "old fools."
The relief was short-term.
A nail in my Oxford career's coffin was nailed by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns to Murdoch's papers each week.
My door was locked.
I was walking inside, and after five minutes, my stalkers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a dead weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the object of such intimidation and poison in the educational institution.
It is even more tragic, however, that it was Oxford, of which not only 14 conservative premieres were created, but which, to this day, also hides behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance rather than glory"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion" launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Nate Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemish and other famous Italian designers.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabela I. English, is the only place in the British capital worthy to host the Valentine Garavani exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the "Valentino: Master of Fashion" event, which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," she says with her unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signorre" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino has always felt charmed by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which will last until 3 March, overflows with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the city of Voghera in the north of Italy to the international idol of the "Bohemian society".
Having a royal family is not a bad thing.
"They at least don't rub a stick of cigarette into a great carpet, like some beautiful pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemish.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains guests abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
"Valentino always liked elegance rather than glory.
And he's still a star."
Valeria Mazz shows Valentina
Even Argentina’s model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the designer.
"It's been a long time since we've had one show in Piazza di Spagna, Rome, and we've had dinner with him.
There were 20 of us, and we had Sharon Stone and John Kennedy younger.
In every detail of his apartment, his decoration, his food, his music, he died in everything and felt his spirit.
Thanks to him, all the invited people could feel important and loved," recalls the top model who began working with him during the Paris week of top fashion in 1995.
"He will never come out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Show of Beauty
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but of truly restored love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries was converted into a unique 70-foot passage that offers a role exchange: a visitor will change into a model and march the passage to observe the "generality" of dreams that Valentina's masterpieces wear as a dress that Jackie Kennedy had chosen to her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that Monica Vitti wore in "Night", or a coat of wool and fur that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In the audience, names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria from Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit Norway, Rosario Bulgaria and Sophie Habsburg are on the show.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentino's first is first love, "can't forget him."
"I remember perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vest "gillette" and jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," said Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muse.
"I prefer him to others for his femininity and great love for women because he underlines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he's using, they brighten up, and they give a spark to his face.
The ratios are perfect."
Not even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how Valentina first put on.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she longed to be of age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
She finally got to the end of the '90s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentino to celebrate at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a dress with called out, a crushed nutrients and a top without shoulders.
It was a dream that became reality," says the widow after Rodriguez d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is fashionable, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocracy, whose life relates between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has the designer's dress "very carefully... because the dress isn't just a dress, it's also a collection of memories that they have in them".
"King" of fashion
The gold highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding to Paul the Greek in 1995.
To create these silk dresses of ivory colour with sewn pearls, twelve types of different laces and a four-and-a-half-metre lift were needed four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstress).
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the biggest authority in the specialized press, this dress represents the milestone of the top fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from a high society".
Valentino, dazzled over the years by the elite "savoir-être", is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honour in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated by the Order of the Honorary Legion, accumulates as much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his selectivity, calmness, prepared and perfect appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum a month ago.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was perfect, time left no trace of him."
When the princess says so...
The world's toughest craft: carriers of sulphur in the Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, carriers in the area of Indonesian volcano with their lives and health, putting up 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living taking sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
That's why they have to walk every day to the bottom of the crater, where they escape sulphur gases from the inside of the Earth, and when they come into contact with the air, they move into a solid state.
After cutting off large blocks of sulphur, which together weighs up to 70 kilos, it carries them on its shoulders in two bamboo baskets along the steep stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 metres long, it is only 250 meters, but it takes exhausted carriers more than 40 minutes to climb up at the tortoise pace, because they maintain a balance and carefully reflect on their steps so that they do not slip and fall into the abysss.
They know that any stumbling could have cost them life, as it happened to one French tourist who collapsed from Kawah Ijen's rocks years ago.
The miners in Kawah Ijen make five cents for each kilo of sulphur they make
When they are up, they pave the way around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and tirelessly carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is a company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has benefited from volcanoes since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar bleaching.
"Because it is normally carried 70 kilos, we will make about 46,000 rupees (€3.8) for every trip," Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and at the end is destroyed, but it can make 138,000 rupees (EUR 11.5) per day.
Even though it seems like a negligible amount for such inhuman efforts, it's three times what he would make in the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, 15,000 rupees (€1.2) per day and the salary for fourteen days is two million rupees (167)," explains the carrier who worked on the island of Bali as a wall.
There was his salary of 75 000 rupees (6.2 euro) per day and work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason, which is as convincing in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto's asthma, he's breathing sick, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto three times a day risks living in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulphur has already begun to charge its taxes, even though its face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will be working for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than good English.
This friendly and intelligent young man, affected by fate, could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead he does the work of a carrier.
It shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulphur does not stop building at night and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and bright.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto drives into the crater and illuminates the path of a small lamp, which is attached to the helmet and bought it himself with his money.
About 400 carriers carry on the shoulder a basket with sulphur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, sulfur mining has not mechanized cost savings, nor has it provided to self-employed carriers and with such effort, any equipment.
In fact, they don't even get a share of 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) from the photography charge, which together with the ticket for 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2) select the nature park guards from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for cattle, and not for people," claims Madrusin, a strong 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 kilos and assures us that he can keep working, "as long as he can," because he needs money to train his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not gonna retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life
Although sulphur burns the throat and pinches in the eyes when the wind turns unexpectedly and traps the miners in the thick fumes that come out of the volcano, the miners are so claiming that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... but it is obvious from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of baskets.
The Unainik, who balances his back basket, can load only 50 kg at 53 years old.
Every day he and his colleagues climb in a volcano of 15 tons of sulphur, which then three trucks take a steep road between the thicket to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik, opening wide mouths, missing several teeth.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty - year - old, he also earns by mining sulphur.
Time goes by, but the constant misery of one of the world's most difficult craftsmanships persists from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporens blame that they do not have children, careers, stress and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm married, and I'm a patriot, you're my wife, and you're a patriot, and let's do our civic duty and create a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of an ad for menthol candy, but yet - or maybe that's why - the video spread massively on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local "let's put the chick in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
The artistic director of Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfil their "citizen's duty".
"This is all about the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the country's biggest problem.
We are the worst in the world in reproduction of our population, so we felt that it was a subject we had to touch.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things, like spread perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible, like make a rap to solve this problem?"
1.2 children
Whoever doesn't take it lightly is the Singapore government.
It will spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
But all of these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy urban state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its representatives' conservativeism and strict social control.
The birth rate in Singapore is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded was 2, which is considered a recovery rate, in 1976.
Why, in fact, do Singaporens have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the Department of Marriage and the National Office for Population Family, says that this is due to "better education" and "wider career opportunities".
"So people have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, it is not just a wedding and a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to the postponement of marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there were efforts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the population, it caused dissatisfaction among the local population.
On some Singapore websites, you can see uncovered xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore Government Party recorded its worst electoral outcome since the beginning of its independence.
After the elections, there was an effort to solve the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unanticipated Consequences
While the fall in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, there are also some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence the real estate business.
The office of urban development began to regulate the number of small flats known as shoe boxes that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have a great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments can support youthful lifestyles and discourage developers to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, the CEO of the EL Developers, claims that their shoeboxes are sold far faster than larger houses.
"They're more popular, so they sell days or weeks faster than larger houses.
That's why they're so much better for our money flow."
However, it acknowledges that the new standards lay down clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could be aimed at increasing the birth rate of the nation, the conversation with Singaporens working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have a great effect.
"People are always stressed, houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people postpone it," says the young official.
"The others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20-year-old, young man.
Men and women refer to careers, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to force citizens to have children, they are, in the end, Singaporens who have the last word about starting a family.
What is private offline is both private and online
Private.
According to the dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something that has a personal character or a "private life area that everyone has the right to protect against any interference".
What is privacy for a person under 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet issues that he would certainly not tell anyone during regular communication?
Journalists from elPeriodico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years old who are frequent internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely personal" in personal terms and as "user name and password" when it was a social network.
"My biggest secret would not be published," Jorge says in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secretive, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I put nice pictures or pictures of us playing at the FB.
I'm talking to my friends there, too.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine, or a photo that would make fun of someone," she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 of his friends on the FB and his nine Twitter fans.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I set up a Twitter account so I could express my views and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone's gonna answer, I'm just putting them in there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," she says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from a stranger.
He wouldn't even care if he was recommended by someone unknown.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and the last mentioned network admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid because we have something in common, such as music," she says.
According to this boy, none of them set him up, nor did he ask for an address or a phone number.
"If they insist on me or require me, I will simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading his Twitter recommendations.
This boy is no stranger to what is now called cyberbullying.
"They blackmailed friends on the social media.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he says.
According to José, the victim didn't log out of the account.
"She's only activated a private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps how to set up an account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post pictures of people known in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I'd do it if I didn't care or if I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in the field of Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents to be well-oriented on social networks, they need to understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform themselves.
He states that: "Internet was created as a means of searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital natives and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, yet we are only learning ourselves," he says.
It explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at the age when they are not mature".
Also, to be, as far as the surroundings are concerned, discreet, at a time when what they most desire is to be liked, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way is to show children and adolescents what privacy is, to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do anything, it's not working," he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porras lists some of the possibilities: Are there things you would not tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo the way you posted your friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
When you label people in the photos of the celebrations, did you ask them for permission?
And one more: does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to realize that they must behave in the Internet as well as outside it.
They're the same rules.
"Man is out of the Internet guided by respect, morality and other principles, and it should be the same on social networks," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-degree teacher, and an educational advisor explains that it is essential for parents to read the social network rules carefully.
"If they understand every trickery, they have a good reason to talk to the children about the consequences that an online account may have.
For example, when it comes to age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
Guardia believes that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "do not speak to strangers".
South America Summit ends and Lima Declaration has not been published
The sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Peru today has ended without a Declaration from Lima, which has been aired and allegedly signed by the seven Presidents present.
Efe repeatedly attempted access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur organisation, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the presidential offices, who initially agreed to publish the document after the summit, stated that it would be published later on the Peruvian government website.
They also stated that the content was published by the Peruvian President Ollant Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly with no sound was transmitted in the press room with a message of "disclosure session, unsolicited transmission of sound".
A small amount of information that journalists had at their disposal was provided by the press speakers of some governments who were present, but not by the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document published during the negotiations was a list of participants in the presidents, which triggered the failure of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent out an e-mail to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but it is just a statement by President Humala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Arabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion, the originally promised Declaration of Lima was not published, even though it was eagerly required by the press.
On the official website of ASPA you can find out that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasts for all journalists, but they completely prevented the provision of information.
The Summit concluded, inter alia, with a joint commitment from Chile and Peru to the adoption of the judgment of the Hague Court, which settles a dispute on the border between the two countries.
The President of Peru Ollant Humal and President Chile Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which will begin, on Monday, by hearing the defence speech of both parties, to discuss the dispute initiated by Lima against Santiago.
"We will submit ourselves and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing in this international court today," said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," added Piñera and greeted President Humal with a hand at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they were subject to a decision of the International Court of Justice was published after Colombia adopted the Bogot Pact this week, thus expressing submission to the judgments of the International Court which decided on maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be entirely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from the Unasur organisation in 2011 after the appeal of then President Fernando Lug and did not attend the meeting.
President Ollant Humal's host was commissioned to open the morning speeches and close the Lima Summit shortly after noon.
The President read the final document stating that 16 agreements were adopted and 31 projects were planned between South American countries, with an investment of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR Member States would take 'essential steps towards a goal in the form of South American citizenship for which residence agreements are extended'.
He informed that actions were encouraged to improve 'cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and organised international crime, in order to improve the availability of medicines and the cheap internet in all parts of South America and in joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters'.
When Europe is in a crisis, "it is not economic consolidation (Latin America) that is to be won, but it is to be used to expand our productivity and to show our nations a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links between different locations of South America, particularly rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic links," said the Peruvian President in his speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and the transversal axes of its territory from coast to Brazil, and the other two concern a better link with Ecuador, but did not mention more details.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its return to the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues raised by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area, which is comprehensive and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, the Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, before attending a regional meeting, said that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning a dispute on the maritime border, which is being challenged by Bogota.
"It is possible that I will meet President Daniel Ortega tomorrow ( Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor the Treaty with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortego that we should conduct the negotiations in the most civilised and considerate form possible," said Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peñi Nieta.
As part of the summit, the EU Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the field of defence.
Members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa announced today that creating a common citizenship is a goal in which “in this case South America, in fact, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, declared on national television that the Europeans "killed themselves during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now there is practically one country".
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that the Member States of the Unasur organisation support.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country that is already taking place amongst the members of the Andean Community must be achieved, however, there are still retaliatory areas that want to bring us back to the past," he pointed out.
The President of Ecuador said, inter alia, that he agreed to regroup the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States would be reduced and that those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights would be taken into account.
"The leaders never commit themselves to anything, and we South Americans sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is funded by the United States in Washington," said the founders of WikiLeaks Julian Assange in a reference to political asylum granted by Ecuador.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time "there was reasonable suspicion that Assange could be released to a third country irrespective of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticised Swedish justice, which asked him to be questioned on Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "the own Swedish legislation allows him to conduct an interview with a videoconferencing call that could take place from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa reported that there is a risk that Assange will suffer a deterioration in both physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was on our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that she had minor lung problems, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
"But it threatens to worsen its physical and mental condition because it is closed in a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.
That would mark everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange from June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London under a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that discussions had taken place with London to resolve the incarceration of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings at various European courts," he said.
He said that "if the United Kingdom issues a pass tomorrow, it'll all end."
And if Sweden hears Mr Assange at the Ecuador's embassy in London or through Skype, as the legislation there is without a problem, and as has already been done in other cases, tomorrow will be the end of this problem."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and made it clear that he certainly does not tolerate "substandardity, ill intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us evil and perverted politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, pressure and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy that neither such journalists, "no bankers, no hegemonic country, nor the bourgeoisie do not control Ecuador", and stated that if it was re-elected, "it will continue to change in the right direction and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay regarding membership in the Unasur Union at least until its next elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and intolerant of opportunism and puchism covered in legality" because it "actually destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy".
In addition, the President of Ecuador stated that he considered the wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time following the judgment of the International Court of Hague, which decided in favour of Nicaragua.
The judgment is currently not acceptable.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed in a broad manner to be overcome and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed his hope for the settlement of the dispute on the maritime border, which is being settled at the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed his view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries undertake to take a verdict, no matter how hard it may be".
In the context of the possibility of running for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to apply for a third term of office, he noted that he perceives this option 'with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult'.
Correa stated that if he loses the election in February 2013, he would leave public life.
"I have never personally been interested in much, but the unfair situation, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only be rectified by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I had won, it would have been my last presidential term and then I would have left politics.
If we lose, I'll have the same thing.
I've already made up my mind," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health treatment of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela in Cuba.
"I have just spoken to Vice President Nicolás Madur, Venezuela, who says President Chávez has gone to routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a recurrence in the President's health condition," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State attended today the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was concluded by calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are due to late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test results were confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning had struck me," he says in his memories of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "relieve a little," but clearly without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and to inform himself about it, with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most ancient patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several fights against the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since 22 years of age, which was something unimaginable at the beginning of the 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, neither the director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) said goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
That's when having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive and live with this syndrome.
However, there are a lot of people who don't know about their disease and lose them when the virus caused the destruction of the organism and potentiated the immune system and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years after the AIDS disease occurred in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "meaning a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who starts with treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as for healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head of the HIV Unit at the Guadalajara Civil Hospital, saying that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists concluded that since 2008, AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that the duration of survival and full-life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, and that it is better for those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years of age.
Simply put, this means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age can, according to these findings, "live without problems while respecting treatment up to 75 years", explained the doctor in the interview.
To emphasise this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is 76 years old today.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS decreased from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS) it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died from the discovery of AIDS according to national statistics.
Only in the state of Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and until this May 187 so far. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
Why do people continue to die from disease?
"It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibility of accessing treatment.
This is how I see it. This is what happens in our hospital.
The problem is that patients come in very advanced stages because they do not know the state of the disease, or late stage of the disease."
It adds a convincing statement: "Nine of ten patients come when an associated infection is present. All we need to do to improve the impact of overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore large-scale tests are needed to detect the disease of all those who ask for it".
In his proposal, experts and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco, as well as patients like Fabrizio, who came to get tests in a private laboratory only because his friend did it, and despite his low age, he had already developed AIDS disease and also suffered from Kaposi’s sarcom, a cancer disease that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather go three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
Change was for better, healthy eating, training, taking medication."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with the journal MILENIO JALISSCO, in order to motivate those who are afraid today on World Day AIDS.
And if they've already been diagnosed, whether they can live like anyone else if they're responsible.
This message summarizes the password of the battle against AIDS this year.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a great gap between health and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a guadalayar journalist, who finds out about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task "the giving of condoms has really increased, they have previously given us one or two, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms", he said.
Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new diseases.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacies employees and medical staff who want to avoid teens, says the reporter.
He suggested to change this ineffective distribution. Let the condoms not only be behind the counter, but let the hundred be found in the dispensers in the public bathrooms, in places where young people often go.
"It's not promiscuity support.
It's not even about paying them a beer and a motel, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to divide the condoms in his county.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already lead sex life," he said.
Key numbers in the State of Jalisco
There have been 13 435 cases (1258 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This situation is the fourth place in Mexico in new and identified cases of AIDS and 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the disease is carried out on a sexual basis, 6% by blood route, 2% by the perinatal route.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with the HIV virus, as there are four to five people who do not know about the disease for one registered case.
A judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of Grupo Vitro, established by bankruptcy in Mexico, gives rise to an unsustainable precedent for any national undertaking with branches in the neighbouring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, it seems that the procedures for restructuring companies that allow Mexican laws, the country of stripes and stars, despite international agreements, do not apply.
The approval of the judgment delivered on 15 June last year by Judge Harline Hale at the Northern Texas bankruptcy court leaves in practice Mexican companies without defence against the possibility to confiscate their property on the other bank of the El Bravo River.
However, the judgment opens the door to the Supreme Court of the United States to the main Mexican glass producer with appeals against three irregularities.
At the outset, while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the Insolvency Act of the United States, the Fifth Division Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure lays down bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, this would point to the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
The United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was essentially created for this purpose, as determined by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote of the branches of the internal business structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro vis-à-vis the branches is recognised, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring would not be reached.
However, this possibility of Mexican law is permitted.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agrimex and Comercial Mexicana, for which the Federal Negotiation Institute has given rise to internal debt.
In addition, it is true that even after subtracting the votes of the branches, creditors - who opposed Vitro in the United States, i.e. the funds of " vultures", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach the majority.
The vote would reach about 45 percent in 37.
This information shall not be taken into account by the Board of Appeal.
From a different point of view, the Court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it faced since 2008 against the background of the serious economic crisis which struck the United States.
In the meantime, González Sady’s family company will appeal for a new assessment directly at the appeal court, so that the assessment takes place for full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, since it originally voted only three.
If he fails here, he will demand the revision of the higher instance process as an appeal, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
On the case, it is serious that the court disregarded a document sent by the Mexican Government as a service of amicus curiae, which describes in detail the Vitro's procedure under the Conciliation Act, and points out that the company has made it easier to adhere to agreements signed by both countries to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the Insolvency Act of the United States.
Moreover, it points out that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, namely the rules for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for both Vitro and the State.
Overall score
Without notice, a few months of criminal notice of the Mexican Aviation Departments against the former owner of the company, Gaston Azcarrag Andrad, who was accused of fraudulent conduct, was laid on the table, and according to the pilot trade union, the vessel had already overflowed.
The cases led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau have just brought an action before the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he is accusing of obstructions in the pursuit of justice.
According to the Authority, the Authority has systematically refused to report to the Republic’s General Prosecutor’s Office on the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, in which it selected 198 million pesos from the F/589 fideikomis bank.
The funds were probably directed towards the purchase of shares of the Professional de Hotels.
As we know, Azcarraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Martu
On the grounds of Universidad de Caribe, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens, who approved the creation of a association, met in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kankun.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge business and distribution centre with "large-walled" products aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which in the lower part would include a residential area for employees from 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has been able to unite the governors of the South-East Zone to oppose a monumental area which would partly destroy the protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
The end of the ACTA issue
The request to the Chamber, which was not taken into account by the Government and which required an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador signed the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting in Japan, known under the heading ‘ACTA’, pursuant to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicoo de la Propedad Industrial), has ceased to be up-to-date.
As we know, it has happened despite the fact that the Senate itself has ruled out the possibility to regard it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not to influence short-term debts, Homex has placed investment certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical to offer interest payments every 28 days.
Competival is born
The merger of leading information technology companies, such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, created an association with the trade name Competival, which aims to market software services in Central and South America.
Investment in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this hall sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the local basketball history as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was excited about this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, player of the national basketball league BSN, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league or president of the Puerto Rican basketball federation.
"I played a lot of roles during my life in basketball, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the National League of BSN, the general manager of the national team and the head of the federation," Reyes reminded his faithful wife, who visited Primera Hora in his home in Bayamón for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify.
Bayamón in Heart
With the greatest movement of all, they guard those who resemble his action in the los Vaqueros from the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or team owner.
"It was my best summer, which I enjoyed most, because I had the opportunity with the team Los Vaqueros since 1967 to participate in eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when he debuted in the BSN with Jerome Coency.
At that time, the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was a former coach here and then worked at the Alabama University in Birmingham, said to me: "I have a grown-up two-meter player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of a Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended to me the quarterback Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said if Mincy brought Bayamon to the championship, Gausse would contribute to the next."
The champion, when he played for the team, Vaqueros, enjoyed Gausse, but only remotely, because in 1988 he was already the president of the basketball federation.
At that time he wanted to devote himself fully to his duties and enjoy Mincy's location on the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in the 1989 Olympics match in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we ended up in the neighborhood, but we were supposed to have a bronze without that Canadian referee who let us repeat the final shooting," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the Panameric Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we raised a team of the United States that was quite similar to the one that blew our bronze at the World Cup.
The team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fic López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also there were youths (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to knee injuries.
The team, which may not have had the perfect composition, but it was able to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was a team from the 1995 Olympic qualification in Neuquén, Argentina.
With the soupist players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players excluded due to the struggle in the Panameric games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was without a doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His international tournament numbers are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his actions in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arilla from young people.
Which success in the Federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national BSN league had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you miss?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a division of youth categories by region.
For example, that the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for trainers, assistant judges and referees.
Nice to meet you.
What are you now dedicated to?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, who was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, world-famous John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." on the Dallas TV series, in which he embodyed a man who acted recklessly and was tricky and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil magnate J.R. Ewing on the Dallas TV series became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died according to the official announcement of the family that the Associated Press provided to the production company Dallas Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon for complications associated with cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked best," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in the Dallas hospital," said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, amusing, kind, kind and talented and I will miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the full," Linda Gray said in the announcement.
The Hagmans diagnosed liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted himself that he drank a lot for years.
He had a malignant tumor in his liver in 1995, and Hagman had a transplant.
Years before the Dallas series, Hagman became famous on TV as a decent guy in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets an attractive girl (jin) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedys that were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in the films included roles that were well accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was until Hangman's mastery in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the starboard peak.
The drama series of the CBS station about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan, "Who shot Jejár?", which was to create expectations about the work of emotion, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculation by viewers around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in resembling offices.
This also helped to achieve a record in the ratings.
On average, 41 million TV viewers watched the response in November 1980, and Dallas became the second most popular entertainment show in history after the end of the series MASH in 1983, which watched 50 million viewers.
At J.R., his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant and threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left town, but there were others who had a reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewinga, an insatiable greedy woman with a charismatic smile: a craftsman and an unfaithful husband who tried to keep his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in a rehab room.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on a tombstone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be, "Here lies J.R. Ewing's honest citizen."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on canvas and beyond".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate to know and love him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series broadcast TNT a few months ago with great success.
"The filming of five parts of the second row was completed and the sixth one was just rolling," the television station informed.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no announcement from Warner or from TNT Station about how the show will continue.
A native from Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of an actress and singer, Mary Martin, who shined in classical works, such as the musicals of the South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was Ben Hagman's lawyer.
In the early 1950 ’ s, Larry tried his luck on theatre scenes in New York City and then served in England at the Air Force between 1952 and 1956.
That's where he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, who he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the city of Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he published an autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew would hurt anyone or harm them somehow," he told the agency, "Prens Asocida."
After a liver transplant he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery and then," he said.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starting a course that examines the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the professor of religion Stuart Charme decided to take a course this semester on the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar to come on December 21, caught many people as proof that the end of the world was coming.
However, Charmé had no idea what was ahead of him in the next few months: the disaster hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call the "debted Armageddon" and the growing conflict that Israel is involved in, a place where, according to Christians, theorists of the end of the world, the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester he's ever been," Charme told the students of Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When one is discussing what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, evil means good to the apocalyptic thinkers.
And it is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, an expert assistant to Barry Vacker is holding a course called "The Resources, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We are considering why these thoughts are expanding over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
If, for example, nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and examine how different they are from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform the students of what was possible, likely, incredible and impossible," says Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University in Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, an expert assistant in the history of art and anthropology, joined in order to hold a course with the simple name of the end of the world.
"We do not join the "2012" because we always count on the possibility of holding the course again if the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the "true destruction", students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work "until just the evening of the anticipated end of the world," said Restall.
Courses have become quite popular.
"He spread out within two hours," said Restall about his course for high-average students, which applied for 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received questions by e-mail about whether there was still room.
Students themselves ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
Thus, apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is only a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which to teach," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confessional student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the date of the end of December 21st.
"Our first project was about Mayan predictions, and we will refute it in some way," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at Temple University from West Chester.
"Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back a few centuries, people reacting to changes in their surroundings with predictions about the end of the world.
The Internet caused the bloom of these speculations.
"Jinde doesn't think about it," he said.
This is happening in the vast majority of the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who lectured in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew about a course on "the end of the world", answered quickly.
"Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote and suggested an exception at the highest office.
We have the grace of the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there was talk of many days of the last court, and he said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will perish.
The dates are taken lightly by students and professors.
Several have said that they intend to go to the "end of the world" ceremony.
"I guess I'll call some friends to laugh together," explained Samir Ford's 20-year-old communication student.
