Black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying hard to find money to repair a disintegrating highway network, many are starting to see solutions in a small black box that easily fits into your car's machine board.
The equipment that follows every kilometre that the motorist leaves and transmits this information to the authorities is at the heart of the controversial efforts of Washington and the state planning authorities to renew the outdated funding system of the US major roads.
Usually, the fast-track design of motorways suddenly stimulated an intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
The Libertarians gathered with groups of environmentalists and lobbyed for the government to use these small lockers, which would record the kilometres and maybe where you're going, and then they would use this information to build a tax measure.
Tea party's scared.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of problems in protecting privacy.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states are waiting for nothing.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for the kilometre of the road he is on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter where we can choose much," said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Southern California State Administration Association, who is planning to launch surveillance for every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used to do so.
The fact is that the Road Trust Fund, financed by the taxes that Americans pay at the gas stations, is down.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
The cars go a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise their taxes by even a single cent.
"The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this payment system for a mile.
"It seems to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Experts call it a user fee, depending on the number of miles away.
It is no surprise that this idea is liked by urban liberals, because taxes can be used to change driver behaviour patterns, which, for example, can help reduce traffic congestion and the formation of greenhouse gases.
California’s designers look at this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (Deputy of Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Committee on Transport, said he also saw this as the most functional long-term alternative.
The Free Market Representatives of the Reason Foundation are also in favour of the idea that drivers will pay for kilometers.
"It's not a tax that disappears in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of the strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former American transport ministers, who in 2011 encouraged Congress to head for payment per kilometre.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project to cover about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the population, whose daily life often means to offend many kilometres behind work outside of the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The worst is Oregon, who included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the tax on the kilometres, instead of the gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is currently investigating the project.
Illinois is trying to do so to a limited extent for freight cars.
A coalition of I-95, which includes 17 state transport ministries, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, does not only have supporters.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteers’ cars were equipped recently, drivers were concerned about the government’s ability to monitor their movements.
“The concern about monitoring Big Brother type and similar issues was a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who manages strategy and operation at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: "It would be very easy to transform these devices into a fully-fledged tracking device."
There is no need to build a huge, heavy technological infrastructure that will inevitably extend to the register of day-to-day exits and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to watch how many kilometers of the car it finds, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, said Khan, the public will be calmer.
Hon brought some state agencies to a small California company called True Mileage.
This company was originally not involved in an action to assist the government in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging legal liability insurance market, where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they were going.
But this device, which is testing, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and delivers only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to do this if you do not follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, a number of major mistakes have occurred.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they may not take any facilities and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on an average number of kilometres of all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places, they hope that the prudent public will approach this concept if the device can do more, no less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay parking hours in addition, to provide insurance by miles and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so that motorists can avoid traffic congestion.
"Motors will be willing to participate in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them," says the city's projection document.
However, some transport designers would like to know whether all the discussions on payment per kilometre are not just a huge problem of representation.
The officials of the Metropolitan Committee on Transport in the San Francisco Bay say that Congress could easily solve the problem with a bankrupt Road Trust Fund by increasing the gas tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for a radical operation, if you just take the aspirin richly," said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
She's negotiating for the ČSSD on Saturday.
Social democracy is dredging, the peoples and the Babies are talking together and are preparing a common process.
If the social democrats get in the way within a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly converged partners who will put a ready list of demands on the table, including ministerial posts.
The ambassadors of the ČSSD then either swallow sour coalition grapes or nod to a drilling minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka met for the first time after four days of sympathy on a wave of sympathies.
Yesterday, he failed to master the political grémism and, most importantly, to force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator on the side is only he, the other team members will be allowed after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CMO).
I apologized to the members of the grémium and now to the citizens.
It's not supposed to lie, it's not supposed to be in personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hašek after the negotiations of the narrowest management of social democracy.
He added that he is not clinging to the position of First Vice-President.
"I will communicate my decision on 10 November at the HVV," Hašek said.
Similarly, Vice-President Zdeněk Š Kromach and the head of the Member State Club, Jerome Tejc, spoke.
However, he pointed out that he was elected just two days ago.
Both MPs then declared that they would do everything in their power to make the 50-member club of the ČSSD sound with one vote.
"I am a member of the ČSSD for 15 years, I have always been loyal to her mark and respected the decisions of the party authorities."
So another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget, at the call for Sobotk's resignation and his elimination from the negotiating team, that the August UVV made 57 percent of the vote that Bohuslav Sobotka was a candidate for the party for the premiere?
The head of the ČSSD, however, by convening the UVV until next Sunday, produced a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of 192 members of this body and the media with all sorts of rumors and rumors, eventually reminding the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
There will be a very powerful washing of dirty linen, signs of a dark alliance between the carbon well-being of Zdeněk Bakala and the Sobots Wing.
The friendly relationship of Bohuslav Sobotka and influential attorney Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
There are disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the ČSSD.
Warnings are the words of Ostrava's mayor and Sobotkov's ally Petr Kajnar: "I signed Charter 77 to prevent idiots from ruling the country."
If the UN were to meet this weekend, liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
The traitors will burn their heads with ashes and stay.
And now the winning boss of the ČSSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on OH problems in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he just deep breaths, "It's hard."
Cooperation with the organizational team of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic Mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower than that.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, not so much in terms of providing information on essential things.
For three months, we've been pacifying them to deliver to us how the villages will be officially marked so that we can do a whole range of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they keep saying they're communicating that thing.
They still communicate in a number of ways.
Is the Olympic village finished?
But it's no longer a catastrophic state.
A month ago, we were walking around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What do you mean, they're empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just basic concrete, that was the condition a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we get there on January 26th, it'll still smell glue.
And if they can't make it, what will be?
President Putin would you say he'd run an army there?
That's exactly what's gonna happen.
Just so it wasn't that the Olympic village = the Potemkin village.
Rather, they are at risk of not being able, for example, to adjust their journeys, to complete the details.
Maybe they'll have a trip in such a state that we'll have to take the sticks from the London games with us.
But I believe they'll put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number is changing.
Maybe the figure skaters will probably go in the trio they went out.
No one has to doubt about the fast skater Martina Sáblík, but otherwise it's in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I'm not supposed to be there until January 26th.
What houses will look like in the Olympic village, we know.
We even measured some of the things on the subway ourselves, so that we don't just believe the sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the Head of Mission do a hundred days before the Olympics?
I'm preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I'm making a common agenda in terms of communication with the Organising Committee in Sochi.
Putin promised him an environmental Olympics, a plan he had a giant secret landfill.
Fans of winter sports are already cutting meters until the opening of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are looking at their preparation with increasing concerns.
The Russian Olympics, though not until February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to be unable to fulfill the promise that the preparation and performance of games will not harm the nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
In addition, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a bar built up very high, and the Canadian games entered the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organise "zero-waste" games has long been his.
Last week, AP reporters discovered a huge landfill of building materials in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
In August, environmentalists found a landfill full of building materials, tyres, canisters and insulation foams, which they immediately reported.
Russia's authorities have gone dark, and the landfill has disappeared.
Just for a little while.
Last week, reporters had a look at a dump of the size of three football pitches.
He is not the only one, in the area of such places, described the British newspaper The Times.
Russian railways, state monopoly, are working on the site, which builds an approximately 60-mile route between Sochi airport and the sports resort.
One of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Jakunin, led a company that had already swallowed 280 billion rubles.
In August, the railways defended that one of the subcontractors founded the landfill.
But the locals are desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštyr, trucks have been driving around the village for three months and nights.
According to experts, the waste is likely to contaminate the local river Mzymtu, other streams and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates the juicy water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," said the British newspaper Vladimir Kimayev from the environmental non-profit organization EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian Organising Committee and the Government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
To compare: Games in Sochi will cost $51 billion, while the Summer Olympics in Beijing 2008 went to $43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost only 19 billion and the said Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays, and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights have not been respected in the work of the exhibition of sports and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers stitched his mouth to protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers deal with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during games.
Some visitors are about to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple ripe for living with their parents, new house offers privacy for both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was commissioned to design a house on a plot located at the corner of two streets, while the property itself is somewhat considering.
It was also required that two generations live in the house that would want to live together, but each of them should have its own clearly separated space.
A younger couple needed an extra small office.
The house is located at the corner of two streets and on a slightly protruding property.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"We respected family ties, history, and memories associated with a given place in the design."
"Three different functions of the house are connected through several paths through the exterior of the object, so everyone realizes the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explain.
Parents’ home is at the garden level with an old pine tree, which is related to family traditions and memories.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ from one end to the other from one end to another.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was formed by the panels of the boards, the part where the office is, is projectioned white and the remaining elements remained in the clean concrete design without any further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very connected with the exterior.
The home of parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The interior connection with the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which starts at the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the house of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house by the main entrance to the hall and then climb up the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to fall through them.
It was precisely what architects were trying to distinguish the house from others and print something unique to him.
The house of the young couple is treated as one open space with kitchen, dining room and living room together.
Only a glass wall with sliding doors separates it from the terrace.

The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is tied in a clean combination of white and black color.
The staircase is a dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance, find themselves in the entrance hall and then climb up the stairs.
Defend academic freedoms, it applies to Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters by students, teachers and the management of secondary and university schools in several regions to defend academic freedoms from electoral campaigns carried out at schools by President Miloš Zeman.
I met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused a lecture by the honorary president of the SPOZ - Zemanovci during the pre-election period, was even retaliated in the form of a non-invitation to celebrate the state holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer brave and the visit to Miloš Zeman made possible: University of Technology in Brno, Hladnov School in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, University of Commerce in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubice for the continuation of policy enforcement in universities.
Newly elected Member of the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and also seems normal to him.
Professor, it really isn't the same as if you were to remain, for example, the mayor of a smaller city.
Do you want to join the chiefs of the ČSSD, who perform at the same time the duties of a Member and a governor and, like them, degrade both professions?
Because you tell people that you can handle both these challenging functions in the left back.
I know, we have an example of Michal Hašek, who manages several dozen functions at once.
I don't think that's an example of a person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post so that she can fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean's office is, however, that you will be violating the apolitical nature of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current performance on both posts as an advantage for the University.
"Your" school, however, will be able to help without becoming a dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion as I do with Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your withdrawal and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may find that the voters will count for you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to last long.
In Kunovice, bubbly cabbage does not add chemistry to it.
Over a thousand tons of sour cabbages want to be produced in Slovacké Fruta Kunovice in the coming months, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season started here in October and will last about six months.
Healthy delicacy has been produced here since 1925 in a traditional way, i.e. by trampling directly in large dances.
In modern industrial times, it's about rarity.
Our workers will find a 20-mile-long route behind the shift.
15 to 30 tons of cabbage can be found in each of the ten tanks, one can be filled with three shifts," said the director of the Slovácká Fruta, David Klarobka.
Head cabbages are carried directly from their fields by farmers from Ostrava and Břeclav.
Fruta's staff then cleans the vegetables, removes the churches and throws them into the circle.
From there, the cut cabbage falls into pools with a depth of six meters, where hookers dressed in white clothing and shavings work tirelessly.
They're putting out unwanted air.
The last stoop of cabbage is covered with tarpaulin and loaded with water.
"The green ring then matures six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of acidification aids," said director Klastroba.
The natural process corresponds to the production under domestic conditions, the individual layers of workers pouring salt and cumin.
The cabbage travels to the filling line after fermentation.
It is packed in a sweet acid infusion into bags or glasses and is sterilised.
Hamé supplies sour cabbage mainly on the domestic and Slovak market.
He also registers interest in it in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "co-operate" with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a tipper at U.S. intelligence, announced that he was willing to leave for Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament unless the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are able to answer questions about her activities.
The German Member Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, a Member who handed over the media on Friday in Berlin, states: “Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to act as a fugitive to the opposition and to try to criminalize political speeches with heavy actions that give no room for defence.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States government to drop the criminal charges against him.
The accusations made by the U.S. Justice Department include spying and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to Zeit Online: “If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.”
The tension in the relationship between the US and Germany began to rise when the claim came that NSA was bugging Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of the Parliament who runs a parliamentary panel that oversees the news, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr Snowden as a witness “without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the US”, this should be done.
Mr Sträbel, a Member of Parliament for the German Green Party, published on his Twitter paper a picture he is with Mr Snowden.
Two German journalists accompanied him on their way to Russia.
Mr Sträbele said that according to a former contract attorney, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he had left once.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be "safe" there, said a member of Parliament.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign associated with persecution that forced him to leave home.
However, he said that the reaction of the whole world to his “act of political expression ” gave him courage.
Citizens across the country and high officials – including those in the United States – have assessed the revelation of an unjustified system of omnipresent surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
We're sorry to kill, but we're innocent, defend the Red Khmers.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Red Khmer hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
In the government of the Red Khmer, which was based on the mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, lives were lost as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the then population.
This commander of the infamous S-21 prison was sentenced to a life sentence by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they acted in the best interests of the nation and did not know what the real extent of killing was.
"It is easy to say that I should know everything, understand everything and therefore intervene and correct the situation," said Khieu Samphan in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is, I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea stated that he had never ordered the Red Khmer casters "to treat people badly or kill them to deny them food or to commit genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I want to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, their families, all the Cambodian people," he said.
A 55-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Red Khmer regime, told AFP that she could not accept an apology from Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"I just want to be acquitted."
"She doesn't care about the other," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordinates wouldn't have killed," she added, "that the leaders of the Red Khmers are worse than monsters."
The "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Red Khmer regime of Ieng Sara was also to be brought before the court, but he died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found ineligible in September 2012 because of dementia.
The leader of the Red Khmer Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 in its years for the storage of hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to USD 100 for hand luggage and USD 2 for coffee or soda, although in their notification on Wednesday they said that passengers will be able to keep the whole can.
The new charge for hand luggage concerns luggage in the upper storage area, so that small luggage under the seat remains free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance and $100 if the passengers with the payment wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier Kate O'Malley, spokesperson of the company, said that the hundred-dollar fee was to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would not like to charge this fee," she said.
The airlines started charging the first and second baggage handed over in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed into hand luggage hidden in storage space as much as they could, so there was often no room in this space.
Fees are one of the ways to teach passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the point of this new fee isn't to get more money.
The point is that the most loyal customers of Frontier have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage area is increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in front of Frontier's gate can bring a luggage for which he will pay nothing, while the other passenger in the queue will pay $100 for the same baggage.
O'Malley said that the website and the check-in procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before they arrive at the gate.
The new charge to Frontier for hand luggage will not be in force until summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money, and the passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street perceive an additional baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of loss.
Most, however, did not touch the fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago and another low-cost company Allegiant Air followed its example later.
The only company that also has such charges is Hungarian Wizz Air, says air advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the Spirit's hand baggage fee would bring USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former head of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit fee for hand luggage.
"It was the most smooth thing I've ever seen in my aviation career," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth and fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and the start took place in a moment.”
The Frontier will also apply the fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice in the form of Spirit.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be added free of charge.
The water will continue to be served free of charge.
In 2008, U.S. Airways briefly attempted to introduce a charge for beverages, but after complaints by passengers seven months later, and no other significant airline imitated it.
The last move of Frontier to charge hand luggage if passengers do not purchase a flight directly from this airline is its last attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
The airline pays online travel dealers such as Orbitz between 10 and 25 USD for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines the incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them instead of doing so via internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she started giving customers who bought through an Internet travel agency only half a mile in a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the bounty for miles to 25 percent of the miles from a given trip.
So a journey with Frontier, a thousand miles long, purchased through an internet travel agency, is a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make their purchase directly via Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and lose money.
According to the financial results reported at the centre of the Republic Airways Holdings, sales dropped by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
The Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier by selling this airline.
The NSA doesn't blame hackers for the crash, but "internal error"
The secret National Security Agency reported last Friday that her website for a few hours last week fell due to an internal error, not because of an attack by hackers, as some said on the Internet.
“The NSA.gov pages were not available for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update,” said the spy agency in the e-mail statement.
The problem will be eliminated during tonight.
The claim that the blackout was caused by a DDoS attack (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Previously, online server sensors recorded that NSA website didn't work for at least six hours this evening, and the site is still unavailable for some users.
Formerly, the spokesperson of the NSA station ABC News reported that internal sensitive networks of the Agency were not "at all" threatened.
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for eliminating NSA sites through the DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target websites with information until the servers are overloaded and the site falls.
This cybernetic tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to enter the internal network of the target system.
In recent months, the former NSA super-secret agency, once nicknamed No such agency, has become the focus of public attention and a biteful product of alienating NSA classified files from the agency and disclosing them to a disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the Agency has stimulated earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cybernetic operation.
Bombardier's profit fell due to a decline in supplies and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15 % decrease in net profit due to a smaller number of orders and supplies of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any data on the air test for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will comply with the ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times and raised the question of whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results failed to fill estimates and stock exchanges in Toronto by 8 percent.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst of state bank, reduced the rating from “higher profitability” to “sector performance” on Thursday, expecting the stock exchange to experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While smaller aircraft supplies were generally expected, the profit margin in the field of transport has greatly disappointed us," Doerksen said in the report to the clients.
As the trial program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders from CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are notified in the coming months, we assume that market scepticism will increase in relation to this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft are fighting to the bottom of the market, which are now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was revealed in March and after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding CSeries aircraft orders is modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company’s claims regarding the low consumption and cost savings of this transport aircraft.
There are currently 403 orders and obligations from 15 customers and operators.
Managing Director Pierre Beaudoin expected that Bombardier would achieve its 300-binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
Managers also assured analysts and media that the program was going according to plan on Thursday.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin in a conference call and noted that the earth check-up and software updates were planned during the outage.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did.
This will happen throughout the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the other of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the others soon thereafter.
Nevertheless, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer could start operating the plane CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier argues that it has assessed its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – even though it is in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – will probably strengthen our view that commissioning will be shifted to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
Out of $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier fell to USD 147 million in the third quarter of 30 September, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted yields per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover dropped marginally from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system Thomson Reuters, the analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it delivered only 45 aircraft over the quarter compared to 57 aircraft a year before.
Clean orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion on 30 September, which does not change until 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our prospects, but low order income and overall market status failed us," Beaudoin said.
The revenue in the aviation industry decreased by 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, stated that the revenue in this division increased by almost 11 percent to USD 2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts amounted to 32.6 billion on 30 September, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was influenced by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The leaders stated that new perspectives would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced the arrival of Google's financial director Patrick Pichettea, decreased by 8.5 percent on Thursday afternoon to 4.83 USD.
On Thursday, the Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest producer of commercial aircraft and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, announced a 10 % loss in quarterly profit.
A cocaine lawyer who warned the mob about a police investigation is in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was supposed to give information to the King of the Underworld Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who informed a drug mobster about a major police investigation because he was afraid that his drug addiction would come out was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had, after becoming a suspect in cocaine use, to the head of the underworld of Neil Scarbrough's sensitive investigation into his drug smuggling activities.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party), who was celebrated as the best lawyer by the criminals, was arrested at home in 2011 following the police surveillance of Scarborough, who was represented in previous drug proceedings.
The cops saw Sarborough (32), leaving three cocaine bags at his lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just having dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Based on the tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular Class A drug user.
During the period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried to gain insight into the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects at the time were followed in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After a series of raids, the police seized heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million along with GBP 200 000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) was giving information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would occur.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, experienced a shameful moment before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of defending justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
During his earlier hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's downfall occurred after Scarborough's police investigation found out he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, spotted his arrival in Ditt's house, and saw him put 60 percent clean drugs under a lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Then he was Scarborough with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular phone call.
The lawyer came home to find the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two.
It was said in the court that traces of Class A drug were found in his hair, wallet, and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, and he said that he talked to a suspected dealer because he was his client, and argued that their conversation was part of a "disclosure".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken.
In a police interview, he said that he was running an office both at his home and at his workplace, and that his clients visited him at home for work.
However, the court heard that after the key arrests, he contacted important drug supply chain players, some of whom had previously been represented to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Who else is more aware that he must not violate the law than a lawyer in the criminal field."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a lawyer and of getting too close to a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal customer relationship.
The police investigation has wasted as much as possible to allow them to continue their crime.
Mr. Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession, but he dishonored it.
He became too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta rejected the offense and stated: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I would like to give Mr Scarborough information, I would not expect 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
However, after the hearing, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta, from a criminal justice attorney, became a criminal himself the moment he began getting drugs from organized criminals.”
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organized crime groups, who have given him the task of gathering valuable information about the police investigation.
The attorneys must stick to the highest principles of integrity and have confidence and confidence in the public that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cape of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crimes Unit has led an investigation against Mr Ditt, which also convicted him of three cases of cocaine possession and now for preventing justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring a criminal to trial.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is outside the scope of the law.
We'll find you and put you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of association for the purpose of supplying heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another 35 persons involved in the trade were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death cell block in America, as a guest for dinner, he would like Mohammed Ali and, as an incentive for the work, he indicated inequality.
He negotiated with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of John Kasal have sent against Babish.
In the elections of the 14 Members, the people received only a third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of the YES.
But they enter into negotiations on the government with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to argue the outline of the possible coalition, Jan Kasal - a man who has adjusted the terms of government participation for the folk in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrej Babiš don't have such a matador on their side.
This time, I think, will be a reminder of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenyan press was outraged by the controversial media law
"It is a frightening report and it is in place to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply washing up the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the papers, which considered the bill to be unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be prejudiced because it is an extended hand of government” and that restrictions on content and advertising will harm Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill actually gives the government "full control of the media" and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya has "restricted a hard blow" and criticise the bill as "severe".
The approval of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack of the Islamic shooter at the Westgate Shopping Centre.
The anger of the authorities was turned on by the Kenya media when the security camera was broadcast, on which soldiers sent to the scene of the attack reportedly robbed the luxury goods store.
The police director responded by calling two journalists and a media head of staff for questioning, but the appeal was later withdrawn after the pressure of the media.
According to the new bill, media companies can be fined for up to 20 million Kenya shillings and individual journalists up to one million together with the risk of "disfellowshipping" or may be denied official journalism accreditation.
The General Court shall also have the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “one fine is enough to eliminate most radio stations. ”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what is called the “living blogosphere”.
Politicians know that when media silences, they can do whatever they want.
“You never know what can happen,” wrote a journalist in the newspaper Nation Mutuma Mathiu and described Kenya’s media as the key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it on the politicians, they will lead the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
In the past, the legislators in Kenya have been the focus of criticism to the public.
In May, they voted to cancel cuts ordered by the National Wage Agency and to restore their fatty salaries to around 532,000 non-taxed shillings per month, which are thus among the highest in the world.
They must be saved, young Czechs know.
But most of them don't even know what interest
More and more Czechs are putting their money aside.
Yet they do not reach the savings champions in the region.
The most money is saved by Austrians, who save on average EUR 181 a month.
A little more than the Czechs will save people in Slovakia.
This is based on a survey of the Erste Savings Barometer in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also shows that the mood of the organizers is improving, and two thirds of the respondents plan to put more money aside.
While the Czechs are about in the middle of a ranking of organizers, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little savings products.
For example, almost every other Serb saves "under a pillow" according to a survey.
This year, there has been an increase in the number of those who save a month higher amounts.
Last year, a thousand to 2,5 thousand crowns of 26 percent of respondents put aside for all sorts of savings each month, this year it is five percent more.
The average monthly savings in the year-on-year comparison decreased slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit among the savings products is pension insurance.
This favours 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular method for assessing savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings decreases; compared to last year, interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly.
They're only 16 percent of the respondents, while they were almost a quarter of the people last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what income they make on individual products.
In particular, young people under the age of 30 don't know how much their money is paid.
On the other hand, the oldest group of respondents has the best knowledge of the profitability of their money saved, and 73 percent of people over 50 know that.
In international comparison, Erste Czechs are leading the use of online banking, which regularly uses 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12 percent distance.
The UN celebrates the new objectives of combating poverty
The United Nations is immediately working on a new set of objectives that will replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Prior to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, the Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the ‘sustainable Development Goals’ to replace the MDGs, whose validity expires in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by the world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ki-mun said overnight at the summit that now is the time to "rise above national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over a process to implement the general objectives of sustainable development – the SDG," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate granted to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the sustainable development goals that are building on the success of the MDG.
The security concerns of Mozambique are escalating due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the Mosombic President of the Founder, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maput to call peace passwords to a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Executive Director of the Investment Company.
Out of fear for the future of her country, she exchanged her business clothing for a shirt decorated with the inscription “requesting security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the Square of Independence in the capital.
For two weeks, nearly daily reports of conflicts between the government forces and the Renamo party came about one of the worst fights since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous insurgent movement, originally supported by the Belarusian government in Rhodesia and then by the government of apartheid in South Africa as part of an effort to destabilize the independent government of that country.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became a opposition party.
Analysts believe that it is unlikely that an open conflict would erupt in the country, but recent events would frighten foreign investors and locals.
The fast-growing economy is at stake, since the discovery of large-scale coastal reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest can, in the next few years, bring more than $50 billion of investment to companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale, the Italian Eni and American Anadarko.
The ruling party of Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo have blamed each other for the tension that arises.
Renamo claims that the government caused the last conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the Sofala province, the traditional Renamo Basis.
The violent assault of the former rebels subsequently culminated when the government forces attacked the base of the Renamo Party and attempted to kill Aphons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said the spokesperson of the Renaulto Mazanga Party for the Financial Times.
The government is accusing Renamo of running conflicts because they say it attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebusa tried to alleviate the fear of instability.
Mr Guebusa for the French press office AFP said on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "lost" who wanted to use "anything he could to prove to the government that he could order his own decisions".
Both Frelimo and Renamo claim to want to avoid war.
However, concerns have increased when Mr Mazanga's words were quoted that the Renamo Party is withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
The letter of France Télécom said that it meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness," said Mr Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have done to relieve tensions between these parties, stirred up by a series of strife this year, few.
It is a gap between two great personalities (Guebusa and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at the Open University and an expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither one of them is a good negotiator, and neither of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The renamo party, which sought electoral change, has already said that it would boycott the municipal elections planned for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort to gain benefits and financial benefits from the government.
The vote of the Renamo Party has decreased since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former member of the Renamo Party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebusa – who ends his second term next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a democratic multi-party system, he does not want a transparent election, he does not want peace because he does not want to release the presidential office," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what possibilities the party has for Renamo, but it has carried out disruptive terrorist attacks on police stations and on vehicles on a key road between the north and south.
Most of the fights occurred in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres away from Maputo capital, but where is Beira, a port on which mining companies rely, including Rio Tinto and Vale, when exporting coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique was not good,” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased government frustration, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is solely borne by the government and the President and that he is to be the one to find a solution to the problems," he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the road," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models for a way of life," says the author.
The stories of Thór can show that “gross power cannot be equal to cleverness, ” while the art legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
A large part of the myths would “be too wild to teach at school, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene,” said Crossley-Holland, who is advocating a careful selection of works of an appropriate age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been defending this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructive” authors and teachers are like a “disabled” switch in a meticulous story with a“ subthreshold” message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who from English translated the epos Beowulf and who also writes Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and British national legends, says: "You can have good intentions, but you can do better if you keep them to yourself."
Probably the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is a feeling of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end in happyend, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; exposed through a story, not openly determined.
The old truth is, it's better to show than to describe.
Brno observatory will take visitors to space in new digitalia
At first sight, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can crash into new comfortable seats and above their heads there was a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, the new projector from Japan.
In order for the painting to be perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered after the hall.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It is about twenty-one computers that generate the image," said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno observatory.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
"The performance of computers is 30 to 40 times higher than that of classic personal computers," said the technician from the observatory Tomáš Hladík.
The digitarium can enchant an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, human body or ocean floor.
The viewers find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the brain of a man.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to project purchased shows and own works in the hall.
Since Saturday, there's been two shows on the show.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People learn about the training of the cosmonauts, they fly into space, they turn to centrifuge, and then they see the demanding conditions of the astronauts in space on visual examples.
The second show is for children and has the title of the Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colourful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the explosion of a nearby volcano occurred.
The entire digitarium cost approximately CZK 50 million, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory from its budget also contributed with less amounts.
Projection area cost 10 million crowns, projector 12 million.
"The rest swallowed audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory passed two years ago.
According to Director Dušek, between 25 and 30,000 visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We've studied 11 Thousand Inzerates!
We know where they want you for work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 ads offering jobs, of which 4300 were published in the daily press and 6800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet therefore becomes the most important media for publishing job offers.
Even in 2005, when the survey was first conducted, the figure was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it was established at around 60 %.
The advertising of job opportunities in itself, according to a significant analysis, reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during the period of economic prosperity and during the economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same period, which was less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is focused on narrower, especially a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider spectrum of professions, including those of the workers, reported the author of the analysis Pavlína Šťastědová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups varies from one media to another.
On the Internet, the Internet has been occupied by ads looking for managers and managers, sales agents, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or managers of small enterprises was on the Internet only.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, but, on the contrary, large representations are mainly service and labour professions.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently mentioned requirements expressed by employers through advertising.
Other areas under observation included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of the foreign language was set out in 3% of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only in two percent of the advertisements, employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of ads (in daily press in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
The practical requirements are combined with qualified professions.
These are in particular head of production and other head of staff.
In the case of workers' professions, especially mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, the author of the study Jiří Tillner added.
Employers shall also include requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates in the middle of their advertisements.
As the most frequently required skills, communication skills have already emerged in the advertising in the first place.
In addition, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, responsibility, organisational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It could be claimed that the city of New York is the place where a solo comic performance was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chair of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes to the people gathered by means of an interview.
Fay's innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York comedy festival.
The festival, founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of Carolines solo comedy, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles have appeared in Carolines and have become successful to the point that they are too big to play at the club," said Hirsch.
We have created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", the annual musical comedy benefit performances in Madison Square Garden, which include Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival has spread, the comedy world has spread.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels such as the show in smaller radio or television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll went out with his sitcom (joys of spicy "League" on a fantastic football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central Station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the Saturday night live and the "Parks and Recreation" program, but the most famous was the rapidly spreading series of videos called "Marcel the shell with shoes".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognisable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, sleek, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the biggest drivers of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedian historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he's here, he's walking through an alley between two buildings, and he's like, man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
The price of oil fell to $96 a barrel.
The price of oil continued to drop on Friday, as high-supply concerns balanced the report that showed the strengthening of the Chinese energy-increasing industry.
The U.S. oil index for December's delivery in the late morning fell in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel.
On Thursday was a drop of 39 cents and for the month of October fell by 5.8 percent.
Rich oil supplies in recent weeks have burdened the price.
On Wednesday, the Ministry of Energy declared that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production gave rise to greater demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to grow after the previous two weak decades to 7.8 percent in the third quarter.
Brent oil, an indicator for international oil also used by American refineries, fell on the International Trade Exchange in London by 26 cents at 108.58 dollars per barrel.
No way, Mr. Hašku.
We have a unique way of telling politicians not to do that.
It is necessary to put such pressure on Martin Hašek to be deprived of all political functions and to leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so weak.
Martin Hašek is bound by the promise he has made, but each and every politician must be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr Babiš has the material one, but it is a question of whether he is a politician).
The better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
In politics he does not apologize, in politics he withdraws.
Mr. Hašku, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm that to me, if you did not just lie - here you see how complicated it is with lying), you will leave politics on your own as a man.
People then accept your apology as an expression by a man who made a mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless weakness whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You want to be proud, whether you're a missing person or a lifetime sketch.
You may think it's unfair when I only address you, but you're the leader and they're just mistaken sheep.
And you're the leader, and you've always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to put your ears down for a while, regroup your forces, sit out the shame, and then attack again, but that's how guerrillas or swindlers behave.
You are, I repeat, the leader of the Alpha male in your eyes, so act like one.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The court blocked the regulation concerning the detention and search of persons by the police department in NY
On Thursday, the Federal Appeal Court blocked a court order requiring changes to the arrest and search of persons in the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge.
The second U.S. court of appeal has said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision will be postponed until the decision on appeal has been made by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city's conclusions and its resolutions were challenged, including the decision to allocate supervision, which would help the police department to change its procedures and its training programme linked to them.
On Tuesday, the Board of Appeal heard the arguments for the postponement requested.
The Court of Appeal has stated that the judge must be removed from the case because she has come into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, namely by not acting as a judge to avoid the appearance of bias, partly because of a series of talks with the media and a public statement, which she openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they were unfairly targeting blacks and Hispanics in their programme of stopping and searching people.
It established independent supervision to oversee major changes, including reform in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test the cameras carried on the body in certain areas where the most frequent detention takes place.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of keeping names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The oral justification for the appeal is planned sometime after 14 March 2014.
Many civil rights defenders have been criticised by the tactics of stopping and searching persons.
In a form, there has been a number of stopping and searching of persons for decades, but the recorded tours under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have increased dramatically to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to minorities, wrote an action which was the case for a group action.
Supporters of changes to the programme of stopping and searching of persons carried out by the police department in New York claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police department, and can influence the use of these procedures by other police departments.
The opponents claim that the changes will reduce police morality, but not crime, and that it will waste money, but it will not solve a wider problem when the police force is under pressure after several thousand people have decreased in the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not put an end to the practice of stopping and searching persons who are constitutional, but reformed the way in which the inspections of the police department in New York were implemented.
Five shopping centers are faced with low attendance
This is based on data from Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle's real estate consultancy companies.
In Prague Bohnice, the Krakow Shopping Centre is opened to the public, it will be the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
There are now 90 big business centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfying performance is about 20 percent of medium and large centres.
The main problems are an inadequately large center against the locality and poor layout, i.e. too many floors or a complicated and opaque arrangement of the passages, or possibly dead places of the centers," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of the retail real estate department, Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvia Samadi is struggling with a low attendance of about a fifth of the shopping centers.
The main reasons include, inter alia, poor transport availability, low income categories of local residents or oversaturity of the market in a given place.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly unsatisfactory at first.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping centers must try harder to attract their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
According to Soták, the availability of shopping centres is generally stable, even with some centres rising, as the tenants were willing to discount their rents in the crisis and rent some units.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened, which are not fully occupied and are therefore reducing the average of the staff (for example Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouc)," Soták said.
The trade centres opened in the past two years are very slow in the market, according to Sylvia Samadi.
However, there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague, we see space for building a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly space on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinence centres', aimed at purchasing and daily needs services for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
Also according to Soták there is a place on the domestic market for other shopping malls.
For both small 'service centers' and large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or enlargements in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have space for further growth," added Soták.
In Prague, they see the space for the upcoming shopping center on the Victory Square, and according to it they have a clear potential of Na Příkopě street and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks, which allow traders to cover and expand into ever smaller cities at favourable rent and operating costs, is also in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, or their reconstructions such as the reconstruction of the Prior shopping houses, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
In the Czech Republic there are currently 90 modern shopping centres with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross rental areas.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to Incoma GfK data.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic is about 50 square meters behind per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check his tip
Former editor of News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods of "phone hacking, tracking and confrontation" to confirm a fraudulent tip on the love relationship that the Home Secretary Charles Clarke was supposed to be involved in.
U.S. Attorney Andrew Edis in the Old Bailey trial said that News of the World caught false reports in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The papers commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and penetrate into her privacy, but the court said that Coulson also called her and left her voicemails.
"The state's attorney suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not a man standing outside the house hoping to catch people outside, but a man who likes to tell stories to see what they say," said Edis.
He said the newspaper NotW used three ways of exploring stories: hacking into the phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently, he knows about the other one, the surveillance, he needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking the phone?
He says he doesn't, we say, "But of course he does."
The rumors about the love relationship Clarke's involved were first captured by the NotW newspaper news department, when the sources that sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby were said: "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A record of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained in Mulcair's house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects".
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about Pawlby, said Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, former Chief Rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup have been overseeing Mrs Pawlby's movements.
Coulson left her a voice message on 18 June 2005 saying: “I got a story that we are about to go out tomorrow and that Charles and I would love to talk about.”
Mr. Edis says that the involvement of Coulson in the story was, according to the same model as other prominent figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
At the trial on Thursday, Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett for a love relationship with a married woman, while he was seeing a fellow defendant named Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied association with other people to hack into their phones from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking the phone.
NSA detection increases the social paranoia of state monitoring
One peaceful day, at the end of August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the American consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the US forward patrol located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claims that the BfV had hoped that it would be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this event launched an exchange of views between the US and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, the American Director of National Intelligence, again insisted that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities, “to steal trade secrets from foreign companies for the benefit of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant, began to reveal his valuable collection from the secret surveillance of the United States, the European Government and the leading entrepreneurs no longer know if they should trust the principal's words.
Following reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying in a Brazilian oil company and gained access to the data with which American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have achieved a general paranoia of state monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came to reveal that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been bugged for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then they are certainly potential targets and leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between American intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY Advisory Service, German companies are convinced that in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the US is now as high a risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in the entire dossier revealed by Mr Snowden that the United States has been handing over trade secrets to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concerns that the EU lacked certain skills in the area of IT and the Internet, and stated that it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
The leading entrepreneurs are skeptical about it.
German Parliament has voiced that we should make German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them again slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidizing, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scope and technical development of the American spy agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking for some companies which have so far believed that China is the biggest threat of surveillance.
There is a large turnover in cloud computing, where European leaders have realized to a wider extent that the data stored in the USA falls under the jurisdiction there and are therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, around 10 percent of non-American members, after the U.S. Data Mining Prism, cancelled the plans to use a cloud provider based in the USA.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “We have a new question for customers who were not here a year ago - where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will stay physically in this jurisdiction? ”
Many German high officials argue that the latest reports only confirm what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and that these data must be protected at all costs.
An economic espionage is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
"It has been a crucial topic for many years, and it has not changed significantly during the current debate," says Kurt Bock, Director-General of the Agrochemical Company BASF.
Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to brag about countermeasures that they have made so that they may not give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB disk at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car company board, says that for many years it is common practice to collect mobile phones before the board meeting to prevent them being used as listening devices.
The German BfV advises managers to consider not using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign travels because of the risk that smart phones can be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be discarded.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are leading global market leaders in their specific areas.
"Small small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized approaches," he warns in his report.
The US warns its own companies of economic espionage from other countries.
According to the Washington Post, US National Intelligence Estimate reported in February France, alongside Russia and Israel, in the second line of perpetrators who were involved in hacking activities for economic rapporteurs, just beyond China.
A board member in a German risk-free society concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said this month in one of the interviews: “Services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a teenage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a young boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a tangled wrestling house in the gym of his high school, believe that their son was murdered, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the town of Valdosta, Georgia, was found stuck in a spiritually balanced stands behind the grandstands of the high school gym he went to.
Sheriff's investigators in Lowendes County concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old is rejecting it.
"They are clearly convinced that their son has been murdered," said lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, for FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff said.
"They are convinced that it contradicts logic, physical laws and common sense," said Crump.
They think it should cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned in a bag of corpses," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death, and he noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
Moore announced at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a normal investigation," he said.
Moore told the journalists that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson died of a "positional suffocation".
According to Moore, however, the second autopsy reported a different cause of death.
"There are several questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if, in the case of Johnson's death, he uncovered enough evidence to order a criminal investigation or violation of civil rights, he would ask the FBI and his execution.
The Deputy Sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not available for comment on Thursday.
The South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the surveillance footage that the investigators have reviewed.
Teenagers hope that the videos will contain a clue to reveal their son’s death.
The CDC Centre issued a directive for schools on allergy in children
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in the case of child food allergies at school.
This is the first set of directives issued by the US Government, because the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The Directive provides for schools information on how the teacher and the staff to notify children’s food allergies and how to react to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also recommends schools to have adrenaline – the most frequently used is the EpiPen automatic injector – to be able to react to potentially dangerous hypersensitivity to life.
The state legislative authorities have recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that occur in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, "It's like someone is fucking in my tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue," or "I'm itching my tongue."
Parents of intersexual children can choose “indeterminate sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with inconclusive sex systems.
Newborn children will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to mention any sex for such children and enables them to mention sex on their birth certificates as "undetermined" or "non-specific".
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to decide quickly with their child for an operation to determine sex, and to combat discrimination against those who are interoperability.
According to the BBC, one intersexual person after many years said: “I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I'm going to be a slatana made by doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year 2000 children are born one that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, genital glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
The gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when you cannot determine sex, it is better to use the best available information and identify them instead of waiting and watching the psychological and physical development of the child until the surgery is carried out, if at all.
New York’s psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender problems, said that the new German law “looks like a good thing”.
Intersexual children represent the ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but it is not the case with most children," he said.
The gender determination can be done without an operation and then it can wait to see how the identity develops.
Knowing how a child develops sexuality is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to sex, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These features can be manifested in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breast and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the labour field, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys not corresponding to any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to label male, female or "third sex" in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became, in June, the world's first recognised "sexless" person, when she won a court appeal so that she could retain the status of "uncertain" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will have, in addition to M (man) and F (woman) and the third designation, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighbouring France, according to a report on France, 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove "sex theory" from school textbooks.
The American Catholic website online also defined itself against the German law and wrote: “With the world drawn to a new state, when gender is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we turn two more pillars of civilization inside out.”
A newborn mother from Maryland also said to Baby Zone that she would prefer to see the children assign sex at birth.
"The parenting itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said to the website about parental care.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to a handsome Greek who had a double sex.
And for about ten years back, the medical community thought that sex was something like a board that could be erased and repainted.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of the operation, with the fact that sexuality is a complex matter, and doctors may sometimes make the wrong decision because they do not know how children will feel about their sexes when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
When these children were born, you called not a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
The ongoing theory of how to treat children with inconclusive sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender was submissive.
He created a new concept of "sexuality" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment – as parents raised their child – influenced the children's genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case from 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theory became questionable.
He recommended that the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged because of his ill - performed circumcision should have his child completely castrated, removed his testicles and raised him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the fact was different," said Drescher.
When the boys were 15 years old, he let himself be re-operated on a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years old, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model ” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared “dissatisfaction with the result”.
It was also a case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but an inconclusive sex system.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfying life”.
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he had female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
He was sent to a vagina plastic at 18.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he requested medical records.
What he found was scary.
I was sterilized after I was born, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender-development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to develop its sexual system properly.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took testosterone doses and had his breast removed,
The operation caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, the legal director of Advocates for informed choice, based in California, is concerned that the German law “proposes for branding and stigmatism”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will reach the goal of encouraging parents to make quick decisions and select “uncertain” for the child,” she said.
We're afraid it'll encourage intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will end, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex".
" Adults should be able to make their own decisions on a legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is going to assign it at birth.
That's a battle a little kid shouldn't have at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with sexual dysfunction and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said that the German law would "give authority" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, Katie developed female traits.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have a uterus and ovaries.
Now Katie is 29-year-old married, and she works as an intern at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or foster motherhood.
"The law will give parents some room so they don't rush into their decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to run some tests and think about it, and it gives them time before they write "man" or "woman".
In this respect, everything is fine - you raise and love your child.
You have an amazing child, and you're enjoying it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
"It brings the possibility to involve the child and the decision-making process and removes the anxiety that the parents bind because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child decides which sex he identifies more – and that is a great thing.
This gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunkard poured the whole house with petrol: He threatened to set it on fire with his own family!
The tension was increasing, the fear was escalating.
A man threatened to set the whole house on fire.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as the fire department from Mladá Boleslav and the voluntary fire department unit, went to the site.
A police negotiator came to the scene, who tried to talk the man out of his irrational behavior.
A man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
The house had to be entered by a task force that damaged the man and tied him up.
The aggressor then ended up in an examination at the Mladnaboleslav hospital, from where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic detention station.
The firemen eventually flooded the house with petrol with a sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition, all domestic animals were saved from the house.
He didn't put a man on a police negotiator, so he was followed by a commando.
Message: Obama's campaign was considering replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, the closest adviser to President Barack Obama secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton for the 2012 candidate.
This revelation is the most important sensation of the eagerly expected book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times got a copy of the upcoming book and announced on Thursday night that the president’s senior co-workers had intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether getting rid of Biden would help resurrect Obama’s faded re-election hope.
According to the national-political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martina, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of the chief officials within the campaign and the White House, namely the former head of the White House of Bill Daley, to measure the effect on the election of the former foreign minister Clinton to the post of vice president.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Just a few of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, former head of Obama's Jim Messina campaign and former chief advisers in the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double Down" claims that Daley was a representative of the effort to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would "not significantly increase Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin Daley, the administration really considered replacing Biden Clinton.
"I intensively examined a number of things, and this was one of them," said Daley.
You must not forget that at that time the president had terrible prospects, so we thought, "Christ, what should we do?"
While Daley characterized research as "due care", Martin told Anderson Cooper from CNN that the re-election campaign spent considerable investment to find out if this election move was worth it.
"The campaigns do not spend such money on elections and qualitative research, if something is really not considered," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about this potential mix-up.
While Daley said that he did not think that the president was aware of the potential change, the former head of the office admitted that it was "probable" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book “Double Down” definitely did not answer the question of whether the political probe had reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on the banishment of Biden from the candidate.
"Maybe," replied Martin.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman produced the first ice cream that shines in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a shining pamphlet.
He came up with the idea when he read the expert treatise on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes luminaires.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer’s language – it increases the pH level in the protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream lights when he reacts with the heat of your mouth, and that's why the more you look, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious", says, "It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to manufacturing, we're at the beginning, so for 200 pounds you'll get about 2 g of this substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your language at neutral pH.
So, as your mouth warms the protein, your pH levels rise and your ice cream starts to shine.
We've been testing it over the last few months and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it's causing this fantastic radiant effect.
She's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the lightening of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every hill costs me, like, GBP 140.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, it's impossible because of a refractory of light caused by a crystal of ice that makes ice cream, but I'm counting on some way to do it, we'll find it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescence properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late and show off our neighbors in disguise.
Today, I feel like I've become a slender.
For two years, there's no candy in my apartment, and this year probably won't be any different.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), this year most Americans – in fact 158 million – will celebrate Halloween and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and ornaments.
But what I look forward to about Halloween is trends.
According to the NRF, 6.9 billion dollars are expected to go into costumes of 1.2 billion dollars.
This year, the latest outburst of sexy, inanimate objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; hot can be food like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies to be seen by the dead parade, and I bet the space men of Daft Punk will be able to reach our Instagram canals this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going by tradition.
Last year, we put on our dogs, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, the Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for pet lovers.
So you'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans spend $1.9 billion.
It's about 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is an amazing message for 41 million carolers who, according to the U.S. Department of Trade, are about to raid our quarter.
In fact, we're going to buy during Halloween, and believe me, we're going to consume 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association, nearly 16,000 tons of them will be sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I've never cracked.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names, like "Terror past the walls," "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are, in the United States, officially dedicated 1200 scary houses that, according to the American haunted houses, have a profit of $500 million, and that includes those amazing pictures of you peeing on fear and giving your friend Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like is going to take a look at the picture and take a comment as "you look nice".
And in the end, something little about pumpkins.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to a big pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and carving pumpkin lanterns is something like decorating a Christmas tree – we've been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to the Pinterest app, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. census office, Americans spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
A pumpkin lantern with a fiery flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245 000 tons of pumpkins grew up this year.
If you're looking for something special, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try cutting their pumpkin weighing almost one tonne.
Announced series of race Land Rovers
The interior has racing seats and six-point safety belts as well as an inter-communication device.
The choice are improved brakes, service package ensuring access to the mechanics Bowler Works, logistics support and storage of the vehicle between the individual races.
Drew Bowler, the technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The participants who are coming to the Bowler have changed. ”
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an achievable way to race the world class.
We are happy to offer this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare contestants for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid races.
The development of the Defender Challenge car we really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge will offer training and testing day in February, as well as the possibility of competing in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: In two years, we have an early election.
The President of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election.
A week after the last one in an interview for Aktuálne.cz, he said there was no other way out, and every government came out of a vote last Friday, and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It cannot last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, with the fact that the lifetime of the initial election period is estimated within two years.
With the objection that the voters will hardly choose completely differently next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the President of TOP 09 does not accept that his party could still lose voters like this year in the next elections (compared to 2010 it lost approximately 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it was clear within two months that the early elections would be, it would strengthen the ANO 2011 movement Andrej Babiše.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where the president of Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of the Lánské part of the Party's leadership, stated that he or Michal Hašek would remain in the management of social democracy, commented on Schwarzenberg in his own way:
"The leaders of the democratic party as little boys follow the head of the state to allow them a coup on the side."
"I thought Mr. Hašek was more skillful and intelligent."
"Because I've never seen anything so badly done in my life," said TOP 09 president.
And in the direction of President Zeman (who he met in the fight for the presidential function) he suffered: "The role of the Head of State is clear: He wants to take the party."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in the House, including the Farský register of contracts, which before the elections were discussed by the House Committees, but with early elections fell under the table.
The CEO of TOP 09 in an interview for Aktuálne.cz claims that such speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 apparently wants to overtake similar experiments from other sides.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO movement Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election struggle that the idea of introducing a register of contracts "steals" the program of the ANO movement.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply dusted off the proposal, which had already taken place in the second reading of the House.
Fire department came to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in a stone house.
Cocker Spanish Ruby escaped after a small car crash.
Three days later, he was seen trapped in a quarry by a man walking a dog.
The firemen weaned on the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was liberated by fire units who came to rescue him after somehow being imprisoned on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry of 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month-old rooster of Ruby's spaniel escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days himself until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and their girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit Stonehouse in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he escaped, when he got into a small accident, they were looking for his lost dog and placing challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, about 2:15 p.m., a bright-sighted dog named Ruby saw a prognosis in a stonestone 15 metres above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station hastened to the site and hastened down to free Ruby, using it to pick up an animal transport bag on a rock.
The expert chief of the technical rescue team Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of a rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't move his brow when he saved his life - he was totally frozen.
He's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual exit.
The fact that someone saw a dog is incredible.
Technical rescue team leader Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky in his escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a search, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was afraid when I looked at the rescue. ”
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him in his arms again.
The vet said if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
Fire department did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they were all just great.
Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there. ”
The firemen were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says that after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely didn't come out.
During an interview for the Australian radio show, this week, the pop star said that for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" of 2004 she sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
And she added, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me."
In a statement from Thursday of Jagger (70), the deputy said that he categorically refused to make any proposals to Katy Perry.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confused with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers (songwriters) who appeared at the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Split Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time there is a warning that its entry into Schengen would be a condition for the EU's independent Scotland membership.
This gave rise to stories of passport controls in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian’s Val.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this did not come into the headlines of the newspapers.
No one also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws, if that is appropriate.
Given that Scotland is not in Schengen right now, the offer of continuing dissent would be a cheap concession for Brussels for whatever the Scots really want.
So it's a pretty weak story.
In addition, so old that it became a dig, a journalistic duck that “independence means passport control,” I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet, there is an interesting thought in this bearded story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why trade the London boulders for the Brussels ones, especially now?
This is a true European story: a great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The result of the euro crisis is the so-called Project Europe officially dead.
Across Europe, they are gaining the influence of a party dedicated to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany, founded this year, came out of nowhere, and has already raised almost five million votes in the federal elections in September, thus basically "damaging" free Democrats out of Bundestag (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
There has always been resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a crucial moment.
Savings dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with a straitjacket wrapped on the national economies through attachment to the common currency, have led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are managing a high budget deficit – that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is the euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters – and this is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only aid is to cut revenue and public expenditure – which Germany calls for.
With the current budgetary and currency problems, the deeper cause of Europe's weak performance is.
As a result of the Brussels-supported "green" energy policy – the code for supporting French and German companies' consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for gasoline in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the area of costs, as we have seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the freezes of wages in the world would not reverse the sinking of the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the USA.
The result is a suffocating rebellion, especially in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that will keep Germany in check and allow Paris to stand up in the world at Washington level.
However, Berlin no longer needs and has left its own economic policy in Europe as a political legitimacy card and a worn-out French economy.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and has pushed the ruling socialists to third place.
The front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – an early warning for British Labourists that they cannot conclude that the cracking of the right is automatically shown on the left.
How does Le Pen deal with her newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
The European elections next year would like to use it to create an anti-European block to act against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely to do so, they can dominate such a block for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
In my mind, in the short term, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will merge and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU does not disappear, but it will become something more freer in the sense of "Europe (sovereign) nations", which was already favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project and to join the United States.
However, the increased interest of Washington in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be a region (principally) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – there is also the possibility to notify Berlin and Brussels when they should leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a relaxed European arrangement, provided that it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thought countries would be easier in a non-Federal Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Government of SNP in Scotland is, surprisingly, the most successful political movement that does not promote austerity in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011 due to its opposition to the cuts planned (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence only to take austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Adult earlier
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
It has not been shown that hormones or other chemicals are behind this
Experts say that one of the triggers of earlier puberty could be obesity epidemics.
The trend of earlier puberty isn't so obvious with the boys.
The former rapporteur, CNN Pat Etheridge, is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should a mother be scared when her daughter begins to grow breasts and pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children’s Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time making sure my parents were not usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” said Kaplowitz
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, hair on the shame and armpits and the body smell, appear earlier in girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there has been a small shift at the age of the first menstruation.
In the United States, the average age now is 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 years in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, at least two to three years before the first menstruation takes place," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem"
The most reliable test of how puberty continues is time.
It discusses what activates the real beginning of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before 8 years of age, the girl is considered "premeditated".
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – which children’s doctors can carefully monitor.
A faster growth may be a reason for the endocrinologist to perform tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are therapeutic procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging, which may eventually lead to a halt in adulthood growth and encroachment.
The recommendations for medicines and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child, the rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
In terms of drug use, Kaplowitz is careful, but acknowledges that “repression of puberty can ease the problems with the girl’s behavior and feelings of being different from her peers”.
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They are concerned that they may become pregnant or how they will handle hygiene," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began to have a period of 10 years.
Although there were indications and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent set of evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 who combine body fat and timing of puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by all possible economic conditions, climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although in boys at a low age there is a hair on the face and shame, the trend towards a full bloom of early puberty is not as obvious as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference have added additional complexity to this topic.
Acne and hair loss are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist from Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to obtain instructions from their child doctor on how to speak to their child.
"This may mean having to talk to a child before you think it is necessary," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who develop earlier need to make sure that, even if this happens early, this process is a normal part of life.
Nadia Konvalinková in the role of innkeeper.
Does he have a new job?
The actress Naďa Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the barge in a pub role and she was very good at it.
That a popular Czech actress would plan a change of profession and get into a pub business?
Nadia Konvalink showed up at James Joyce Irish pub and shot beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right away.
My boss even offered to hire me, and I could use a beer spin.
But I refused, I'd rather stay with what I'm doing today in acting," she said with a smile Konvalink, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish inn.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey there," said the actress.
Nadi, a long-term friend and colleague Pavel Nové, appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and in this new life, I can't drink.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and that's what I'm trying to follow," the actor said.
Aircraft manufacturers fight about the width of seats, there are large orders at stake
There has been a dispute between the leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of the seats in the second class for long-distance flights, which gave rise to a bitter exchange of views on the aviation show in Dubai this month.
The object of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for long-distance flights for the economic class – not the one usually preceded by the airlines, but the space allocated is the key to the performance requirements for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus called this week for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the major American rival Boeing says that airlines are to decide on this.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers competed in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine remote aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the action from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear part of the aircraft is spread out – especially if it is next to each other 9 or 10 seats – is the basis of economic performance claims for the design of new aircraft "mini-jumbo".
Boeing says that the improved model "777X" will deliver 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 model will deliver 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out after 9.
Giant aircraft often challenge each other on technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where it is expected that 777X will gain the advantage with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
He recently showed what might be the start of a new advertising war when he showed the financier a picture showing three people sealed in a restaurant with the title “Would you like it? ”
“Boeing promotes long-distance flights in seat closer than in regional turbopropellers,” said Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
People are bigger when they change their dietary tracts, but the seats on the planes haven't changed radically.
Since the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, by the turn of the century the weight of an average American at the age of 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Health Department.
According to American medical statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a passport of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that his rival is sticking to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of the seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims that it has carried out a research that suggests that the extension of the seat by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing dimensions of Airbus seats rejects and states that it is not the competence of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
“It really is about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do things they believe they must do to make them successful,” said Kent Craver, an expert on the cabin space.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, greater space is essential for elbows, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this dispute, there is a race in aircraft orders with estimated trade in the next decades worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to shift the tongue of American and European exports.
As Reuters said in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 percent better efficiency on their latest design of two-engine long-range aircraft than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
Boeing's performance requirements depend partly on comparing the 777X design with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to a 10-seat concept.
“The reason Boeing does this is to inflate more seats, and make his aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Kenya, who leads the comfort of passengers at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are for thicker distribution that can go hand in hand with lower charges.
"The 45 cm wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view of Airbus the design is motivated by the 777 threat of the model," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network portal.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but they offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers so that they can choose.
Tested aircraft vendors even carry a measuring band to check the competitive arrangements.
While they are being chased by comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 model with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
A long time ago, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin adjustment by offering wider seats in the alleys on some of his aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard of, but may discourage the wave of sales of 777X.
The number of HIV-infected in Prague has exceeded a thousand
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 of them, and 180 of them were already in 2010.
Last year it was infected with 212 and it was a record number.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said the AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for Years.
According to him, from January to September there were 165 HIV patients in the country, and this year there were 176 in the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of this September, the HIV tests were confirmed by 1710 men and 353 women, the most infected in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
In the Central Bohemian Region there were 206 infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravskoslezsky or 116 from Ústecký.
The least infected came from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of the patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with the HIV virus, transferred to them from their mother.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but the show is beautiful, the experts say
Some time after his premiere, the fantastic film from the universe sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic.
In October, he was seen by almost 150 000 viewers, according to the Union’s film distributors, and he made over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the image positively.
However, others find some irregularities in it.
The Lidovka.cz server asked astronomers and astrophysics experts about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of observatory and planetarium Brno): I like scientific and fantastic films that I consider modern, dream fairy tales.
The film Gravity does not exclude, although it looks like a "physically real" show.
No, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You might notice Sandra Bullock's hair that doesn't sort of float in a weightless state.
Hubb's telescope and the International Space Station are moving along significantly different orbits, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some film viewers blame the unrealistic effect and even the whole behavior of fire in a condition of weightlessness.
According to them, suits wouldn't last either.
Heroes in the movie Gravity often get into collisions with various objects and suits without much trouble.
Critics were not spared even a history plot.
According to some discussors, such a great tragedy in Earth’s orbit is unrealistic.
In addition, they wonder why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People argue on the forums about the "unreal" behavior of ropes.
She says she's acting like she's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the observatory and planetarium of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide screen so far, but I can clearly say, I was bewitched.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but science fiction.
And with such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to adhere consistently to reality.
"More than your inconsistencies, I was touched by the three-time demonstration of a space station with a degraded level of technology (the last Chinese)."
"China will probably look better than it is in the movie by the end of the decade."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful in trying not to violate the physical laws, so the natural-oriented viewer appreciates that in various cosmic collisions and collisions the moment of momentum, in words of dictionary physics, also the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic including the thin peel of the atmosphere and the polar glow glaring on the polar areas.
Inconsistencies will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
For example, while reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of the circulation of various cosmic wastes into orbit seems to be reversed in some scenes before it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things were adapted by the creators to their needs, but no fundamental and heavenly misdemeanors against logic or natural laws were involved in the film, and compared to other similar films it is obvious that the creators depended on the credibility of the events displayed.
It's worth mentioning from moments that don't make sense that Hubble's telescope orbits in a different slope than the ISS.
As a result, mutual speed varies considerably, and rescue operations could not, in fact, take place as shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of the Kowalsky (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) separation, I did not notice that the entire ISS would be rotating, so there is no clear origin of forces acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to start at a time when they are no longer moving towards each other.
The new nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before human trials, it is necessary to perform further tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weil Cornell Medical School in New York says that the first signs are good.
"We firmly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong to overcome all current approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information to produce antinicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells that then start to form a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies persecute all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they enter the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine intervention.
In tests for vaccinated mice, which were added additional nicotine, continued their normal activities.
But mice that were not vaccinated “relaxed,” the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine got into their brain.
Experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given so often as to maintain adequate levels of antibodies, so they proved to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower as they convert liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for people are completely safe, they could give themselves to children before they want to try a cigarette, and so they would avoid dependence on nicotine.
However, it would be more likely for smokers to use it to stop.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine, they will have no benefit, and this will help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists have said that the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies Obeid's influence
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Corruption Supervision Committee.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the coastal rental policy at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled property.
The independent anti-corruption committee (ICAC) on Friday extended his search for whether Mr Obeid was lobbying with several ministers to rent him on Circular Quay, where the Obeidas owned two restaurants and cafes, renewed without having to participate in a tender after his expiry in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew about Mr Obeid's classified interests in these properties, on the basis of evidence presented on Thursday by former Deputy Director of the Tripodi Office, Lynn Ashley Ashpole.
During the years of the talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for leases to go to public competition.
The tenants opposed this and also wanted more long-term contractual conditions.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeidas $2.5 million a year, were restored without the need to participate in the competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public competition.
However, he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rental policy.
The transcript of calls submitted at ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Tripod and Steve Dunn, the head of the port department, after working under Mr Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
"Was the topic of interviews during these phone calls the development of commercial rental policy?" asked Mr Tripodi, auxiliary Commissioner.
"No," replied Mr Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not this.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked the target in Syria, said the responsible agent
Israeli military aircraft hit the target in the Syrian port of Lazikija on Thursday night, confirmed the responsible manager of Fox News station.
This responsible officer did not specifically say what the objective was, but he said that there was at least one.
Press Agency Associated Press states that the aim was the S.A.-125 Russian production rockets.
At least twice before this year, Israel launched an air strike on the supply of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it could be agreed, while the President of Štěch was blowing up a dispute.
Hetman Covance was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is the symbol of the poverty of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen have mainly demonstrated their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is fundamental and readable and inapplicable, Vice-President Zaoralek has made the most of conversations on television.
On this basis, I see no better option than that the ČSSD would propose to the Vice-President of the Senate Gajdůšková, the only one who would not have an initial hendikep and I think it would have done the standard performance.
It's such a good solution that someone in the leadership can barely support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdušková could not be afraid to create a minority government with only a blessing from the President of Babiš and without the peoples, but with the People's Minister of Health Call, which is actually a faithful social democrat.
This mini-minor government would have great stability because it would promote a proper referendum law, and this is what the President of Okamura committed himself to supporting.
President Babiš would eventually accept tax progress, for he is bright and will see that it is not possible without it.
People wouldn't be in trouble because the Caller is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in the government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, and a valuable minister would also be found here, but if they do not reasonably want to join a risky government participation but also provide support, well.
Let's give Alena Gajdušková some courage!
Visa-authorised foreign personnel may undergo a ‘authority’ test
As the government intends to extend police operations, it is considering a test of "justification" for foreign personnel with a visa authorisation of 457.
If accepted, the test will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 programme from being used to meet unqualified positions or as a backdoor for family and friends moving to Australia.
When a government discussion article was published today, former Labourist Member Maxine McKew condemned government rhetoric about foreign workers, saying that it could offend Australian neighbours.
“The loud statement “foreigners at the end of the queue” and “work first for Australians” is a very unpleasant remnant from the time the unions requested a protected labour market,” said the Australian-Indian Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the Belarusian labour force should have been protected – and I would not be surprised if anyone in this region had noticed the echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The immigration minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he talks with officials about smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes, and the others remain to be considered.
Where the criteria for ‘entitlement’ are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the applicant is in a relationship or in a personal connection with the owner or the sponsor undertaking concerned’.
After previous experience with businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds of them, companies may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35 - year - old man from Sri Lanka, who was seeking asylum, died suspected of a heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship to the Christmas Islands this week.
A man’s nine - year - old frightened son traveled to Australia along with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday comforted him with an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
The Australian authorities and a man were in a hurry to the hospital in the Christmas Islands where he died.
The British Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will start as soon as the first phase starts in 2026.
The Transport Minister, Baroness Kramer, said that the project "will bring the Great Britain together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was a collaboration with the British government on this plan "exceedededed".
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After the phase two will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government re-evaluated the estimated costs of building a high-speed line between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which conducted interviews with the National Transport Agency of Scotland, commissioned HS2 to identify further railway capacity and the possibility to improve travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is indeed a national network that will better link Great Britain and its cities."
We gave SH2 green because the benefit it brings is huge.
Without that, we face a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also a connection – 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected across the UK thanks to HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
During the Scottish government, Keith Brown, Mr Carmichael, called for "unequivocally" to support Scottish inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed line has the potential to bring extreme economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds economic weight to Scotland in the overall case of high-speed railways across Britain.”
So we are enthusiastic about working with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed railways to Scotland and thus bringing benefits to everyone and supplement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with the British ministers next year and the joint decision on the next steps.
Both the inspection and the anti-corruption police analyst have been arrested with Barta.
Information about the arrest of Vít Barta began to spread on Thursday night, when the message came from the server Prvnípravy.cz.
MF DNES soon found out that the case was in charge of the General Security Corps Inspection (GIBS), her people were to arrest Bart in the centre of Prague.
It took place outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection shall deal with cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its competence shall also apply to civilians.
According to MF DNES, Jan Petržílek is one of the officers arrested by the anti-corruption police - head of analysts and informatics.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
However, the spokesman of the anti-corruption police Jaroslav Ibehej refused to comment on the information, stating that the media had to address the GIBS on this matter.
However, even her spokesperson, Radka Sandorová, did not want to say anything about the case, by turn referred to the Municipal State Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said the spokesperson of Štěpánka Zenklová.
It can also be deduced from this unspecific reaction that the event has taken place, but it is in a covert regime that prevents a spokesperson from saying anything specific.
Bart’s attorney Oldřich Chudoba is also in a similar situation.
He told the media that Barta was representing "even in this matter", but given the fact that it was classified information, he could not confirm Bart's arrest or refute.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
Bart and former VV President Radek John, who was at the head of the Ministry of Interior, were promoting this.
The dispute that was indignant between the ex-premier Petr Nečas and VV even had to be resolved by the then president Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from for me.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I really don't know anything about things," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially promoted by Radek John, the real leader of the party, but Bart was at the time.
Bart has now run for election for the Dawn movement, and the parliamentary mandate has escaped only closely - by 175 votes.
The head of dawn, Tomio Okamura, said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vit Bart was one of many candidates for our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy by Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from Barta Okamura, who before the elections said that he gave Bart space to run for the Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of executioners.
Vít Bart was in court in 2012 with his former partner from VV Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules on the use of electronic equipment on aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will have to continue to switch off their tablets and smartphones during the launch and landing, even though change in the USA to mitigate the regulations regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given US companies space to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical phases of the flight if the equipment remains in “aircraft” mode.
Passengers can already do this during a large part of the flight, but many people are concerned that they cannot have access to their electronic books during the start and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from American carriers to comply with the requirements, but have indicated that they are not planning to amend their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also stated that it had examined this notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
‘Casa currently does not have any specific rules governing the use of electronic equipment in an aircraft,’ he said.
This question is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the whole time and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virginia, who had already spoken with CASA about extending the use of its Wi-Fi onboard entertainment system, was inclined to change, but announced that it would be subject to the decision of the regulatory authority.
"We would welcome if CASA had analyzed permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that this would improve customer experience now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment)," said the spokesman.
Qantas announced that it will, for the time being, follow the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change that in a short time," he said.
The FAA regulations apply to American airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area, which can be useful for our passengers, and we will certainly thoroughly examine the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
In the case of air carriers from the USA, the impact of the regulations will be different from the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
“As soon as the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, passengers can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones at any altitude,” said the FAA.
In rare cases, the low visibility of the crew will order passengers to shut down during the landing of the equipment.
The group also recommended that the heavier device be safely stored under the seats or in the storage area above the head during the take-off and descent.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore live to flourish
In a pawn shop at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is stopping a gold bracelet, ring and earrings so she can pay her daughter her school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money on it," says Mrs.Amirthalinga.
Although every month as an administrator she gets 2400 dollars (3000 SGDs) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is inadequate, says.
Indeed, demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – is that ValueMax, where a woman carries out her transaction, has become a third ranking pawnshop in Singapore this week.
The stopping of jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs.Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, the pawnshops normally apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above 15.4% of the rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, the mills have the advantage of not requiring the verification of the person (payment history) or proof of income, and may lend faster than the banks.
Thus, as families feel pressured by rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium income are turning to pawnshops to deal with a deteriorating financial situation.
This week the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency quoted the increasing use of credit in households mainly due to the increasing rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in view of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of the 80 percent GDP ranking, which is an increase compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also concerned about the high level of consumption debt in Thailand, which just got out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“The important thing is that with rising costs people from middle to low [received scales] will try to complete their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the Malaysian CIMB bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to the imbuedness of people to stop their personal property and take advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 urban pawnshops make up gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and we get him back next month.
In recent months, the largest warehouse operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops.
Growing in the pawn shop is so great that ValueMax, an operator of a branch in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance it by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD that it won this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount creditors have found themselves under fire because of high interest rates, Mrs. Jo says that the pledge not only offers lower rates than the other creditors, but also does not directly increase the debt.
“Customers stop items they already own, and moneying personal property does not increase the debt to the household,” he says.
In the company, property arrest is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure funding.
Besides, those who use pawnshops aren't just people in financial distress.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax branch office to stop gold rods or Rolex watches, so they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all sorts.
"There are rich individuals who need to borrow for the short term due to their bold business or investment, or small businesses who need help solving problems in their cash flow," says Mrs.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as they can.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmanian Health
The federal government insists that the $325 million rescue package for dying health in Tasmania contains tough conditions to ensure that the government does not waste funds.
The Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is making "fast measures" to reverse the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The financing has been decided for four years following government consultations with an independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," said Mrs Plibersek today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at patient's request.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and cataract operations, will help to eliminate debt.
Money is also available for clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved post-operative care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to ideas that the leading clinicians have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian health system," said Mrs Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting and accounting regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the money of the Australian Union and inform the Commission on a monthly basis where additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State provides services as effectively as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will not be of no use until the real reform is followed to lay the foundations of the Tasmanian public health system in a more sustainable way."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for its response to its request for rapid assistance, which it first raised in the negotiations with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe that the federal aid package can get public health out of a critical state," Mr Wilkie said.
According to the government, these additional procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
The spokesperson of the federal opposition in the health sector Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is just a patch.
"The reason I'm here is because the Labour government has removed $430 million from our health system," said ABC TV.
You can't have a government that will take almost half a billion dollars away, and the Australian Union, which devotes $300 million, and pretends to be good news.
Mr Dutton called on Mrs Plibersek to ensure that not one dollar of the rescue package is spent on a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted Denise Diderot's novel, which brings an extraordinary film quest and a time-playing, but it is also more boring than it should be.
It takes place in the 1960s in France and tells a gloomy story about Suzanne, a young noble man who is sent to the monastery by his family.
When they rebel, they experience extremely cruel treatment from a criminally perverted mother introduced, and for others they become an object of sexual passion.
The film never slips into lust or sensibilities, and that's his problem.
The ritualistic nature of this story leads viewers to experience torture like wearing a horsehair shirt.
Skierals want to discount families with children
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons, says the Supervisory Authority.
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition, said the committee on Thursday for global control of chemical weapons, while the violent conflicts in the north of the country broke out, not far from one of the places where toxic substances were supposed to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also declared that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
Notice of the Chemical Weapons Prohibition Organization came the day before 1 November,
the date set by the Hague-based organisation Damascus to destroy or prevent the operation of all chemical weapons equipment and chemical mixing equipment in order to create toxic gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
But Damascus still has to launch the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is assumed that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including typerite and nerve gas of sarin.
The announcement came on Thursday when the battles in the town of Safira, which experts refer to as the headquarters of the chemical weapons and storage plant, were reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain.
A group of activists, which monitored the total number of victims through the network of activists in Syria, announced on Thursday that 120 296 people died.
Of this, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are 29,954 members of Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 armed men from the Hezbollah of Lebanon.
There should also be 2,202 government defectors among the killed and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira, many of which have been associated with Al Qaeda for weeks.
The observer stated on Thursday that the losses were on both sides but did not have specific figures.
The battles have highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, in their mission, must deal with close deadlines in the midst of the ongoing civil war of Syria.
The statement from the OPCW, which cooperates closely with the UN, said that its team was now "satisfyed to verify – and monitor – the destruction of Syria's declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling".
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they finished the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two places because of security concerns.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that these two sites were "decommissioned and ... the items of the chemical weapons programme which it contained were moved to two other declared sites which were checked".
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of the places that inspectors of OPCW could not visit.
Syria has agreed on a plan for the full destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I bow to the courage and bravery that you have shown in carrying out this most demanding mission that this organization has ever had,” said the Director of Observers Ahmet Uzumcu in his comment published by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad's government, with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alawite sect, are now facing each other primarily in the civil war.
As for further developments, the head of the Observer Ramí Abdul Rahmán said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion inside the anti-air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikija.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the judgment over the teacher of the bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the bombing of Bali in 2002 were angry at the judgment given over the last of the educators who had been put before justice, and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for building an explosive device that was used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, followed by 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty in several other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bombings against churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution demanded a life sentence, even though she could insist that a man with the nickname "Demolation man" (drumber) would receive the death penalty because of his reputation as an expert in the production of explosives.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the devastating attack launched by Patek and other schoolteachers almost ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For AAP, Mrs Corteen said: "He should be put in front of a firing squad."
Every day, I have to live with the fact that I don't see other grandchildren and my daughters.
Sari's club was compared to the ground when a heavy charge was launched shortly after October 12, 2002, located in a parked van outside.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month and, while being kept alive, died three times to doctors.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jama Islamija responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like nobody else.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive is just not.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others isn't that much.
Patek was the last of Bali's bombers in court.
The arrest was avoided for almost ten years, but in January 2011, he was caught in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where less than four months later American forces killed the former leader of Al Qaeda Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect with terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not give up voluntarily," said Mrs Corteen.
To date, he has not felt any regret for how much grief he has caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"This year we will see a lot of tears," said Mrs Corteen.
Patek can appeal to the verdict.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technological gains on aircraft (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices from gate to gate – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music based on the eagerly expected new rules issued by the Federal Air Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
As soon as the change will vary according to individual airlines, Michael Huerta, FAA administrator, said at the press conference.
Air carriers will have to demonstrate to what extent their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the crew and the directive on the storage of equipment to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“We can improve the extended use of electronic devices very quickly depending on the status of such a plan,” the FAA stated in her statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane doors are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 km and the captain has issued a warrant.
Passengers are expected to shut down their equipment again when the plane falls to land and not turn it on until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are correctly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and departure, provided the FAA.
Most of the new aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adjusted to allow passengers to use Wifi at a higher altitude, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewardes, welcomed the changes.
“As soon as the new rules are safely implemented – and we will work closely with the transport companies – this will be a success,” she said in her Glading statement.
To be honest, we're tired of looking like "guards."
However, surfing on the Internet, sending e-mails and texting or downloading data will continue to be less than 3 kilometres above sea level, said the Agency.
Passengers will be informed to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to flight mode.
So still no Words with friends, the online game of the scrabble played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as well known, thrown off an American Airlines aircraft because he refused to shut down his equipment when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be stored because of the fear that they might hurt someone if they flew in the cabin.
Phone calls from mobile phones will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not the FAA, but the US Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may revoke the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transport Safety, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered as a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but from FCC data we also know that in the air they can cause interference with the transmission towers," said Rosenker.
In order to investigate this problem, the Commission proposed last month that the government allow the wider use of electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been exerted on the FAA to mitigate restrictions on their use.
Critics like Senator Claire McCaskill, a democrat in Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget their duty to shut down or ignore their facilities.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radios, the technical surplus of the time.
New airlines are much more dedicated to electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations but are also designed and approved by the FAA management to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at altitudes.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
As part of the new rules, the large majority of airlines should be adapted for greater use of electronic equipment, said Huertová.
Current electronic devices generally radiate much less intense radio broadcasting than in previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimal transmissions when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when the devices download or send data.
Among those who press to release restrictions on the use of these facilities by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the representatives of the company loaded the aircraft with Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
The FAA members expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Air Passengers said that he is convinced that the interference from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee stated that there are only fractional reports from pilots to support the fact that such equipment can cause disruption of aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA would allow the pilots to order passengers to shut down their equipment while flying according to low visibility instruments.
The Group of the tourism industry welcomed these changes and according to them it is a reasonable approach for the passenger public, which uses technology to a large extent.
“We are pleased that the FAA has recognised that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with safety,” said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported by air from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on the oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
Last month, one of the quakes was transported by helicopter to Aberdeen after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the rescue center until he recovered.
Colin Seddon’s operations centers said: “This one was probably migrating from northern Europe when a strong wind caught him over the North Sea. ”
Apparently, he ran out of strength and found refuge on the oil platform.
Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help. ”
By the time he was released, he was in good condition and well.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign, launched in April, was committed to linking businesses and defining the changes that British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in relation to the EU.
To this end, we have set up the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we have asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing different sizes of British businesses and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU is stagnating.
They want to see how the government favours new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than catch up in a long and demanding process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopolies to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and businessmen said that the cost of Brussels regulations now outweighs the benefits of being part of the European trade area – even 40 percent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European society.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek a change of contract and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings identified by companies of different sizes and the main business groups indicate that the business sector is pushing for a "sensory change" that will shift the influence back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake – achieving a change in the treaty and a better agreement for Britain can make a profit of up to 16% in the vote in the EU referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the conditions of British membership in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to be a significant shift from the current balance of power back towards Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and, given the way the euro area goes on the road to a narrower economic and fiscal union, it is becoming more and more necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and, as the results of our survey show, for business this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
John Kerry admitted: Spying has gone too far!
The United States has occasionally "too far" in spying," according to AFP, the head of US diplomacy John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
But, according to the Minister, it was used to reverse terrorist attacks.
The first confession from Washington, according to the AFP, sounded in the middle of a violent polemics on both sides of the Atlantic due to a scandalous revelation of a massive data surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which was targeted by American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as did the President (Barack Obama), some of these actions have gone too far and we ensure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he advocated practice so far.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the USA, the assassinations of Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented aircraft from falling, buildings were exploded, and people were murdered because we were able to be informed in time about the plots," Kerry stressed.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information 'in some cases went disproportionately far'.
An affair around American intelligence, which allegedly followed hundreds of millions of phone calls, erupted this month in Europe.
Among other things, it turns out that the Americans were also following the German Chancellor Merkel's cell phone.
Europe’s leaders have not concealed indignation, and some have called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that promises or significantly restricts monitoring.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says that the pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
Starting the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means launching one of the largest European energy projects, said Director Gazprom.
"Today we have witnessed a milestone: construction started on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazpromu Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element in the energy security of the whole European continent.
South Stream should add diversity to Russian export routes through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia's gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, says the officials.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "perpetually" removed.
Once the whole project is launched in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says that the construction is to begin in other countries in the direction of the flow at the end of this year.
The gas pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
They've got a crucial battle ahead of them.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the mountainous area of Kalamun.
According to the still-specifying reports of Israel in Wednesday’s raids to two positions in western Syria, hezbollah’s missiles were destroyed.
This Lebanese Shia organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its program is also a fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but it clearly said that it would prevent the arms from moving to Hezbollah's hands in Lebanon.
The reports of the Wednesday Israeli air raids on the stockpile of weapons in western Syria are still being clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean area of the Syrian missile base Snubar Jabla south of Latakia have hit.
The Al-Arabija news station claims that two warehouses were hit, where the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, it was the missiles of Russian production SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron ben Jishai said that Syria continues to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian air force is teaching members of the armed section of Hezbollah to handle missiles.
The SA-8 are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They're placed on a mobile chassis.
Although they are rather primitive, mobility and small dimensions make it easy to hide.
They're equipped with a radar that, however, turns off after firing, so they're hard to spot.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by ruling avalanches.
It is a well-guarded area, and in the past Hezbollah was involved in fighting in western Syria.
He claims to be helping to protect the Shiite community of Syria, one of which alavité belongs.
Now reportedly 15,000 of his fighters are ready to help conquer the army back to Kalamun.
Together with Hezbollah, the Syrian army also strengthens its troops there.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and Homs' third largest city.
The battle is to be retaliated, according to the source of al-Arabija, for the recent attack of the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite Brigadier Abu Fadla Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army fight back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many insurgents from Kusajr have just left for Kalamun.
Until recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, spending money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals were reported as reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens had this status.
That they didn't really mind and the state that was here (theft and debt of this country) were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I can't explain that 3 413 497 voters did not make the election, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted for ODS in total 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is an over-the-counter majority.
When I add 1,016 829 to the above parties, the ČSSD voters, then with the old order (because all the parties mentioned were involved in the "stealing" and debt of this state), 64.23% of the rightful voters actually agreed to this state.
In fact, the majority of voters have shown that there is no corruption and over-indebtedness for the punishment of the culprits.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD, who participated in it, would apply for appropriate laws?
Is there any way to help us?

The Royal Commission has learned that two staff members of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) were charged with charges against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Committee on Sexual Abuse of Children learned that before the charges against child educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with sexual abuse of children.
But before the commission, it was said that in its opening statement to the Commission, this association stated that they had never dealt with the sexual abuse of a child in their organization.
The executive director Phillip Hare was asked about the case where one of the YMCA employees was accused of offences involving child pornography, and another when the gym teacher at Caringbah of YMCA was convicted in 1991 for sexual harassment of children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, a committee counselor, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He admitted that the opening statement of YMCA was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in the YMCA, which appreciated this organisation as a leading advocate for the rights of children.
The evidence submitted by the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that in the audit of the Ministry of Education and the company in August this year received the second lowest of the four possible assessments.
Mr. Hare, who began to work with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the leadership had failed from him in the downward direction of accepting Mr. Lord without making sure that the staff was aware of the obligation to report a violation of the child safety rules.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of being sexually harassed by 12 boys who he committed in two years when he worked in the YMCA association.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem which prevented the staff from reporting a child safety breach by Mr. Lord.
The staff members provided evidence that they witnessed such violations, including that the Lord was alone with the children, privately guarded them, let them sit on his lap, told them that he liked them, and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of the YMCA children's service association in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to about something."
The Director-General said that he did not accept the evidence of personnel, that they felt uncomfortable if they had to contact their superiors and report the deeds.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord clouded their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said that the YMCA Council in New South Wales had given his opinion that the lesson of the Jonathan Lord case for the organization was that the staff had "not given any message", and the board had agreed with it.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have the staff sign the confidentiality agreement shortly after the charge came in was made by General Manager for Child Services at YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid interference with the evidence, but it was “excessively zealous” and poorly executed.
A child sexual abuse specialist, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that was safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, checking, working, training, and staff management.
The hearing was postponed on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but he admitted that return was unlikely.
In a night interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Office of 59-year-old politician, he expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when Mr Blair resigned in a leading position after ten years, he has generally avoided interviews about British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador to the Bízekrovodní quartet.
When asked whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his response to London newspaper Evening Standard was as follows: “Yes, of course, but it may be difficult to do so, so... ”
While a crowd of experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although they don't go to school yet and only a few months ago he made the first steps, this boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly knit three laps to finally win the main prize and leave behind 30 flying adults.
This inseparable pair – with the same height – was praised for its appearance, behaviour and style at the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudy near Cardiff.
He stood up against the masters and ladies in elegant hats, put his barret in a cheerful angle and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest grades for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given to his third birthday in March, and since then he has been practicing with this Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna (30) said: "Fenton and Toffee work well together."
They didn't have much hope, but they finally left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought it was phenomenal, and all the strangers wanted to take a picture with it.
The boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale in South Wales is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing off horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone encouraged and applauded."
He ran along the sand throughout the length of the arena, and although he was so small, he performed a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farm and got two chickens in charge.
As he started, he'll be back at the Horse of the Year competition soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
The spokesman of the annual horse show show said: “The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control the pony. ”
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they were shown on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good teamwork is between the ponies and the one leading him – and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton helped with some lovely clothes, and he really did fit in with it.
Too curious a newspaper should be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which on the front page asked for the release of a reporter accused of slander, will be thoroughly investigated, said the press administrator.
The New Express newspaper, based in Guangzhou, has made a rare public application for release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr Chen later admitted on TV that he was taking bribes to come up with stories about a society partly owned by the state.
The administrator said that the New Express will now perform a "full repair".
The regulation for "correction" came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and TV in the Province of Kuang-tung.
The preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013 the New Express newspaper from the Yangcheng Group Evening News issued some false reports about the company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of New Express has been out of order," said the administrator in his statement.
He said that he had to decide "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the cancellation of a journalistic licence".
In addition, "he ordered the Yangcheng Group Evening News to complete the New Express letter and recommended that they examine the relevant responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the New Express letter's leadership".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express that concerned financial irregularities in the company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After being detained, his newspapers issued two applications for his release on the front page and claimed to be behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and confessed that he had given false stories for the bribe.
“In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence,” he said.
I did it mainly because I was looking for money and glory.
I realize I did the wrong thing.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he issued a New Express note on the front page of the apology saying that he failed when he failed to carry out sufficient checks on his messages.
Recently, several heavily monitored suspects have made a confession on TV.
Experts say that confessions are still being forced on a regular basis, regardless of the amendment to the law of this year, which prohibits the authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A tunnel was found to smuggle drugs between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, supplemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway, was found.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel of approximately one meter [1 m] as one of the most sophisticated secret corridors they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clinks to almost six football fields, connects a warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses, where trucks can be easily hidden before being loaded with drugs.
The authorities said that the tunnel was closed before the drugs could be transported unnoticed.
The authorities, along with the discovery of the tunnel, also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine according to the court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of convictions, he is facing prison sentences from 10 years to a life sentence.
In Nogales, Arizona, the smugglers penetrate the vast drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which before drug cartels raises the problem as quickly as possible to get its product to consumers.
In 2010 the authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres long equipped with railways, which led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Centre are connecting management.
They will offer, for example, a joint advertisement
New integrated newsroom of the company Economia in Prague, Karlín.
Economia took the next step to transform the Centre holding into its media house.
From Friday, Economia and the Centre have shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into the common media house," comments the changes made by the Vice-President of the Economics Board and appointed CEO Kamil Čermák.
The executive director of the Holdings Centre Andreas Demuth, who will lead the single management.
Pavel Voparil was appointed as the new joint director of trade and is subordinated to both Zuzana Tylčerová.
Stephen Burd became the new head of information technology.
The joint director of the paper is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team is also director of transformation Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pitts was appointed as Director of Marketing.
Věra Lhotská is now managing the separate corporate communication unit.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, managing human resources for both publishing houses led by Petr Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the creation of content of all the titles issued and, last but not least, to significantly improve the company's business management," said Čermák.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a contract to purchase Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of this April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktuálne.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or portfolio of other nearly two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, the news server IHNED.cz, weekly Respekt and Economists and the number of printed and Internet B2B titles.
Among the Czech publishers is the most successful in the sale of digital versions of its main titles.
This June, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Prague, Karlín.
CME will target the TV business.
They'll release almost a quarter of the people.
The CME media group will be releasing.
By the end of the year, he wants to be thinner by a thousand people.
He's going to cut off all of his side-actions and he wants to focus on his main business, television broadcasts.
The group, which owns TV Nova in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs around 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of the people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of MTV music station.
How much savings will be made by the Czech Republic, where the group employs some 650 people, and what this will mean for the TV TV TV Nova, it is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we cannot really comment," said Josef Koukolíček, director of communication.
According to MF DNES, the significant redundancies of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but this should have the greatest impact on the personnel status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both New Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, both new bosses of Newa Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined the longtime director Adrian Sarbu during a conference call with analysts, spoke about wanting to limit all activities that were not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore likely that it will significantly reduce the costs of production of its own programmes, filming and production activities.
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague burned down a cooling tower in the night
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague, a large capacity storage tank was burned, according to firemen apparently a cooling tower.
"The fire was on the way to the fire on Thursday before eleven p.m., the fire was extinguished this morning," said the spokesperson of the Prague firemen Pavlína Adamcová.
The amount of pollutants in the surrounding air did not exceed the permitted limits according to the measurement.
The levels of damage and the causes of the fire are unknown so far.
The area in Kolbenova Street gradually arrived about five dozen firemen.
"It is a fire of a large capacity storage tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the premises, so we are extinguished by means of transport lines from tanks," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, the fire was complicated by a malfunctioning network of fire hydrants, so the firemen had to transport the water from elsewhere.
Fireman's commander has declared second-degree fire alarm.
There are four levels in total, the fourth one is declared in the most serious situations.
The chemists also went to the site to check the level of dangerous substances that could get into the air during the fire.
"But they did not measure in the air the amount of pollutants that would exceed hygiene standards," the spokesperson of the firemen said.
The British police have delivered the release notice to Assange
The British police today delivered a notice of release to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuador embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that he had delivered a release notice to 40-year-old Australian, asking him to come to the police station, and that, if he did not, he could be arrested.
Assange, under the British Law, exhausted his options when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against surrender this month, thus facing the issue in Sweden for sexual crime charges.
Because he was afraid that Stockholm would release him to the US, he sought refuge on 19 June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where this South American country applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard “made a announcement about the release of a 40 - year - old man asking him to come to the police station on the day and hour that he was destined for, ” said the spokesman.
Assange continues to breach bail conditions.
The embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the notice of issue.
Assange is afraid that he will be released from Sweden to the United States, where he can face espionage charges because he published 250 000 US diplomatic papers on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree in Essex was seen in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found out he had a drink cup between his thighs.
At the Colchester Howie Police Court, he confessed to the charge of driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points came to his account, resulting in a six-month ban on proceedings.
Howie was also ordered to pay a cost of £90 and a premium for the accused £100.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble is breaking
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the return of financial assets, but it is waiting for the final decision of Mr Osborn, which in the 2012 budget presented a fee of 7 % for the transfer of real estate to buildings at a price above £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own property within the company, not as individuals.
The income from the property transfer fee in the housing fund in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which in 2012/13 reached 708 million pounds, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Cook said: “With regard to the increase in the transfer of real estate at home of high value and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is low-taxed regardless of the effect of an outdated system of head tax.”
He added that “this move could have made some foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London, or that existing owners were reluctant to sell”.
The top properties – up to 5 % to 10 % of the housing market at the price – in a rich belt that ranges from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded a record-breaking increase of 11,8 % over the past year.
Prices in central London continue to show a steady growth of 5.6% year after year, but were overshadowed by a thriving “home market” in which according to a survey of Savills’s real estate agency, Southwest, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%) growth.
Scientists explained more about how the movement of the tail is related to the mood of the dog
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs drill more right (from a dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs wave the tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can record and respond to these fine differences in the movement of the tail.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, said: “In people, it is well known that the left and right side of the brain have different ties to the stimuli that induce positive or negative emotions. ”
That's what we were trying to see in other species.
He added that, like humans, even dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for leftist movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information on how dogs react to the uneven drilling of the tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Apparently, it won't take long for us to understand why their tail is sometimes on one side, and then on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have screened dogs’ films about dogs – either in natural version or in the form of silhouette – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we have also managed to adjust the movement of the tail and represent it more right or left.”
When the animals saw the otherwise insignificant dog move the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog drilling the tail), they remained perfectly calm.
However, when she recorded the tail filming mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog drilling the tail), their heart rate increased and the animals acted uncertainly.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs would communicate with each other knowingly through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they must and do not have to watch out for.
He said: “If you meet dogs a few times and move their tail in one direction is repeatedly linked to rather friendly behavior and traffic gives birth to less friendly behavior, you will respond based on this experience.”
Researchers say that findings can help the owners of dogs, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
A dog behavior specialist John Bradshaw, a university teacher in animal medicine at Bristol University, said that it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side of the dog is important.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their heads on the left, watching an aggressive dog, and on the right, watching a happy dog.
And in another expert treatise from the University of Victoria, Canada, he said: “With a dog robot, dogs were more likely to meet when he drilled his tail to the left than to the right, when they became more uncertain – just the opposite of an Italian study.”
The difference can, according to him, be given by not treating dogs as dogs in these different studies of animals in movies or dog robots as dogs.
He explained that a study of how dogs react to real dogs could help.
“Although there is strong evidence in the case of many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are not an exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it may not take long to understand why their tail is sometimes on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkeys moved a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved the concert in Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was supposed to perform on Friday at Hydro City Complex.
But the disease of lead singer Alex Turner forced her to move the show.
The announcement of the group came after she was similarly forced to postpone the Thursday performance in the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys states: “After the decision to postpone today’s performance in the LG arena in Birmingham and on the basis of a medical recommendation, Arctic Monkeys must postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1st November.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately he will not be able to perform."
The performance in the LG arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the performance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets to these performances shall remain valid.
We'd like to apologize to everyone who bought the tickets for the inconvenience that caused them.

Pope Francis appoints the first cardinal in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis had first named the new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22.
Cardinals in the clergy of the Catholic Church have the highest position immediately after the Pope and are those who elect the Pope, so Francis establishes his first group of men who will eventually help to select his successors.
Now it's 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the Pope – the group thus shrinks to 120 elected cardinals.
In a statement declaring this report, the fifth of Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting of the current cardinals, known as the Constituentium, would be held prior to the solemn promotion of the new cardinals.
“The Pope František has decided to notify his decision to convene a February Consistency in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that the number of voting cardinals is likely to drop by February.
He said that the Pope usually named as many cardinals as he needed to increase the number of voters to 120 again, and as many cardinals as he wanted over 80 years of age.
The Consistency will be significant next year because it will be the first one after Francis was elected in March this year, said Valero.
At this point, there is a certain orientation on Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope is nominating cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since František appointed the Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope ruled for himself.
"Now Francis chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was possible that these cardinals of the Pope would ask for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before – it is absolutely new.
Valero said that the popes traditionally promoted bishops from large places to the position of cardinals, but František is “a full surprise – so we do not know who he is”.
GM downloads some new light trucks in the USA to repair seat backrests
According to a Friday notification from the US Authority, General Motors withdraws almost 19 000 of its new (2014) light trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to correct the fault with the manual tilting of the backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the mechanism for tilting the front seats may have a defect.
As a result, seat-backs do not comply with the federal standards of automotive safety for head restraints.
The notice on the NHTSA website states that "if the car gets hit from behind, the head restraint does not need to protect passengers correctly, which increases the risk of injury".
The downloaded models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
GM placed on the market in June and for this leading American car company the most important marketing of the vehicle from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the delivery of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not review the notification to the owners due to the 16-day failure of the government, which in October weakened the growth of car sales.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra supplies, which were revised for the 2014 models, increased to around 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, were announced by GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42 660 Silverado models and 16 503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to USD 37.47.

It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's a memory of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews tonight and go to bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions of people and your speeches took your breath.
The elections ended in overwhelming predominance, and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept the papers they got.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
Obama had 82 percent of the aid during its introduction to the office in 2008.
And that's where I close the book.
Going to the present day is a rough wake-up, like waking up from a dream.
It is difficult to recall these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of wasted opportunities.
In years after I dropped my first election ticket, there were really changes.
It was definitely none of what I imagined.
I recognise that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the law on available care to the shift of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy "do not ask questions, do not say anything" after Osama bin Laden was killed.
In addition, I believe that the party's obstructions have reversed so much efforts to move our nation forward: among other things, it is immigration reform, the possibility for the public to choose health care and the closure of the Guantánamo base.
But after many situations where I have defended Obama's administration from my colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit in terms of explanations that they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
Obstruction of Republicans cannot explain their consent to listening to foreign leaders or to raids of unmanned aircraft that kill innocent children overseas.
It can't be explained to them that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the private lives of Americans, nor is it haunting those who expose the government's misdeeds.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due trial or for restricting public contributions and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are "most aggressive... from the Nixon administration".
And most recently, they can't even excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the Act on Available Care Simple Websites.
I don't know if that's what you'd expect.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that government might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected function clearly has no predictable course and our public talks will form a opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I mentioned above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for both again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and uncut alternative, and he seemed unable to consolidate his politics or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hopes we had heard of.
Still, the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – is getting harder through this book.
It makes me remember the many promises that have gone missing.
This week, I read a chapter in my book about Obama's crushing defeat with Clinton at the primarys in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his crew that they had to get back to the pace and remain faithful to their mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over a parental leave programme
Billionaire and Member of Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest because of a parental leave program, because his daughters can become pregnant and benefit from it.
The Mining Magnate, who is having a dispute over the payment of a $6 million taxable amount of coal, made this statement when he tried to wipe out the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest from the table.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Chamber, which play an essential role in deciding whether to collect taxes from coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit from a given policy.
"He was in a great conflict of interest with regard to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in getting a parental leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election of the election committee, she officially declared Mr Palmer a winner in the fight for a chair for the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast area, thanks to the profit of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the electoral results to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closing of the electoral rooms?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, immediately vote and get results at 7:30?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballots.
Is it about the fact that the results can be rubberized if anyone doesn't like them?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic vote and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political programme also applies to Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
The public office is a public service.
"We are not seeking any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands will change your cargo as well.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two had the task of solving the unsolved role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group who had failed to wash their hands had a much more optimistic impression than the one where their participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the "washed hands" group did better than the other one in the next test.
Yet, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not have them washed.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not notice any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results show that physical purity eliminates really negative feelings of failure.
At the same time, however, the motivations are falling, and the testing needs to focus much more on further tests.
If we transfer the results of research to Bohemia, we would probably be most optimistic when we return from the toilet.
After using the toilets it is not only one percent Czech and Czech hands, but it is a fifth on the way.
In general, hygiene is held after gardening or in a workshop where 85 percent of people wash their hands.
The pet’s caressing motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after handing a foreign person.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of the Czechs and 40.3 percent of the Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be in place, I fear the reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," Klaudie Komárková commented.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by the control authorities concerning suspected monetary market machinations is becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperated with competent authorities in investigations into the largest financial market in the world, where they change the owners of $5.3 trillion every day.
The two traders mentioned would be the first employees of the RBS suspended in an expanding investigation to respond to the LIBOR manipulation scandal (Londen interbank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request from the authorities for information this month.
"Our continuing search for this matter continues, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and our other authorities," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people who are close to this event reported that RBS handed over the e-mails and rapid messages from the accounts and accounts of a former trader to the British financial authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position as President of the European Foreign Exchange Trading Organisation with JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European President of Cash Trading in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former manager of the currency trade in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
Neither one of these traders was accused of any offense.
Mr. Usher's group for sending fast messages belonged to the bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said people dedicated to this event.
This week, UBS commented that after the Swiss control body Finma had announced that it had investigated suspected foreign-currency machines in several Swiss banks, it took steps against any of its employees.
The European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Antitrust Office Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office examines the claim that these bankers have joined up to move the monetary market.
The people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched an internal investigation or received a request from the competent authorities for information.
Banks search for years with fast messages and emails to find cases of misdemeanors.
The investigation reports have alerted traders in the area, which has been one of the largest engines for making profits in investment banks' closures in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the fact that small currency instability has reduced opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the severity of the situation when they claimed that with a large and highly liquid foreign currency market, it was essentially impossible to manipulate, but the high position of traders said that it did not necessarily have to be true.
A highly built trader said that, despite the considerable volume of daily trading in foreign currency, liquidity biting between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had released almost USD 6 million from its share trading department this week, which caused a loss of USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notifys the competent authorities and cooperates with their control bodies.
“We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been solved,” said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV-infected in Prague exceeded 1,000
Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
Between the beginning of the follow-up in 1986 and the end of this third quarter, the tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This results from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, 2,063 were infected in the whole of the Czech Republic.
396 immunodeficiency disease has already erupted.
198 people died.
The number of infected people in the Czech Republic has increased every year in the last decade.
In 2002 the tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121.
The survey revealed 156 new diseases in 2009 and 180 in 2010.
Last year, the number dropped to 153, but last year was record-breaking.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who has been leading the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
From October to the end of the year in 2011, the tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, said Hlavatý.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS disease erupted in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to get to know a town should go to a cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through the national center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would reveal to the bedding.
Many people read from the graves.
The cemeteries slowly roam and gain intimate insight into local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what faiths, how big and cohesive families belong to, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
In what way they express their social status, their taste.
And from the state of the graves, they will find out how the survivors care for their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Care Act
The US Supreme Court has decided that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is consistent with the Constitution, a fundamental victory for Obama's administration.
In proportion to the vote 5:4, the court decided that the individual regulation of the Act on the Protection of Patients and Access to Care – which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise threatens to pay a fine – does not oppose the constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
The President of the court, John Roberts, was on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining parts of the Law on 2700 pages and further held that the legal requirement for health care, which requires States to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, would otherwise be at risk of losing all funding of sickness insurance from federal sources, is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
In order to block this law, 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have filed an action.
During the primarys in 2012, the law strongly rejected each of the leading Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
After the words "Mugabe's a lame donkey" no longer threatens to be in jail, the court has abolished the law
Until now, Zimbabwane had to pay good attention to the public speaking about the ninety-eight-year-old Mugab, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, then has been at the forefront of the country since the end of 1987.
According to Section 33 of the Criminal Law, a fine of $100 to one year of imprisonment was threatened for insulting the presidential office.
"National representatives should not be eager to accuse people who comment on the President in pubs or in other public places," said the representatives of the Constitutional Court.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the court's decision, informed the British BBC.
A number of damaged Zimbabwans, among them Tendai Dang, who were arrested by the police two years ago for alleged insults by the President in a fight with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist in Mugabe's public prison ended up being an abuse of a round donkey.
In August then the prosecutor accused a 26-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The Court has also declared the law against constitutional law restricting the freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be false," said the Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law allowed a person who discloses false information to be sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment.
"The existence of a law to criminalise someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to freely express itself," said Malala.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a tough hand for over 33 years, in March Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with wider civil freedoms on the basis of a referendum.
A small step away from the dictatorship of one man, the country entered into the 2009 agreement between Mugab and the opposition, bringing Morgan Tsvangiraj into the Prime Minister's chair.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which was over 100,000 percent.
Therefore, in 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
In Zimbabwe today, only currencies of other countries apply.
The impoverished economy is heading towards Mugabe's reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, did not have any experience running the farm.
Central banks maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument to allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need them.
The banks stated it in their joint statement.
"It is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the chief international economist of the Barclays Bank of London.
"So far all of the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not according to my surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, the Chief Economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers strengthen the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market first broke down.
Central bank agreements have enabled access to the euro, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
Central bankers' decisions come at a time when the American Fed is preparing to end its programme to support the American economy, which could evade the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract is used as a standard to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency, with the current liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be understood as the depository of one currency and the borrowing of the other currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
As Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
Over a year ago, I made a registration on the Tipsport.cz website.
But I didn't finish it because there was someone sitting at the branch who couldn't finish the registration from the internet.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration went down, then I moved in, and I changed my address and my ID card number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that I couldn't do it because I had another OP number, an address, and that I just couldn't finish it and that I had to ask for the deletion of the data and make a new registration.
So I did that, and 24.10.2013 I wrote to technical support that I am asking for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
That's what she wrote to me on a long day of technical support that I have to complete my registration at the branch office.
So he started a marathon of e-mails for technical support, where after the 4th Urgance 25.10. they wrote that personal data was deleted at my request.
So one would think that one could make the new registration, and here again the problems began to write to me that my username was already occupied (it was not deleted - it is not a personal data, but eventually it also excluded this).
So I used a different username and it jumped on me that my personal data had already been stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that claims to have been deleted?), so I contacted again with technical support.
When asked how it was possible to write back that personal data really deleted 25.10. and sent an e-mail with the error.
I did that (at around 3:00 p.m. yesterday) and that's what they wrote to me today, that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that's why it's not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I've been in contact with technical support for a week, and I've been dealing with them for a while?
And what if it was true what it claims (as it is not) no one could register with the same name or date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, I actually registered in those 13.22s on the same name and date of birth, but I used an imaginary e-mail and phone number and world wonders, there appeared to me a page that sent me a link to the e-mail to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register in the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds the registration to an e-mail and phone number and data just didn't disable as it claims.
So again, I've told this technical support that they're just lying (be intentional or don't know what they're writing) because what they're writing is not true.
I demonstrated several screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. So "false" registration simply doesn't affect this.
Tipsport wrote me a rough sentence for that - I'm sorry, but because you're re-registered, we can't verify your claims.
And the communication's over.
It repeats, respectively, the same sentence that the registration relates to the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and it did not actually take place.
So if I summarize this, Tipsport not only did he not erase the data as he claims, but he's still lying when he claims otherwise.
The worse it gets, it's easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like a mistake is on the customer's side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things got a little bit moving and from Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter was passed on for verification and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and warning of the same mistake).
There's music playing on the subway on the Bridge.
Transport company Hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the Music project in metro.
The first vestibule, where the reproduced instrumental music is continuously played during the underground operation, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test run will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
The composer Michal Horáček brought not only his completely new doubleCD Czech calendar to the hall of the City Social House, but especially in the series Among us singers Lenka Novo, František Sagrada and Ondra Rumla accompanied by the excellent Orchestra Matěj Benka.
After the introduction of the intru and the acting etude about the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers on stage, and he came himself with a candle in his hand to remind the story of the last time they played in Cologne and in the theatre and the whole city the electric current fell out.
"In Cologne, however, two kinds of cards were produced, with which I came into contact a lot," he said.
He also reminded President Zeman's native.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zakolany or Dúbravce near Bratislava," he made a joke about the parents of other presidents.
Several times during the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and, if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical work.
The calendar was made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the clock, about the ice hockey, but at that time he had no idea how we were meeting on the squares and chanting, who is not jumping, is not Czech.
That's the name of one song from the Czech Calendar, but we're not playing it for you here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang a very good night's sleep for him from this record, singing at night, and accompanied him on a guitar.
Otherwise, unless he sang, played percussion, all three singers then accompanied the band in the composition of the keyboard, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists together sang a bit of a squealer into the side of the heart, which immediately opened the auditorium.
"I am glad you were impressed by the song, which did not surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček responded.
After the memory of Petr Hapka, I recognize the performance of František Segrada, in the original by Richard Müller awarded with a huge applause, Hana Hegerová reminded me again of the song Dad loved Lída Baarová and the Horáčková explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baar's American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocába reminded again of Sebastián's composition, and Segrado then sang a wonderful piece of Prague, performed by Jarda Svoboda, a sad native and former Kolínák.
But that was the conclusion, applause in the standing and addition in the form of an optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
There was one more add-on on the playlist, but the fans didn't cheer up anymore.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire four seats behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček's books and even the packaging from the legendary LP and with possible interested people took a picture.
Berdycha and Štěpánek will be completed by Rosol and Hájek
At the finals of the Davis Cup against Serbia, the non-playing captain of Czech tennis Jaroslav Navrátil 4th Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek nominated.
The Czech trophies are defending the trophy, but they are going to play on the field of their opponents to the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on the hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
In the finals, Czechs are the third in the last five years.
"We know we're going on hot ground, it's going to be wild, and as always, we need to focus on our performances."
"We will go there with only one goal - to score three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, the instrument of the winning point in last year's finale with Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bomb Syria.
American commando in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Gulf.
The Israelis have demonstrated exactly what the bombardment of Syria is supposed to look like.
Without unnecessary humbing, threatening, and millions of declarations, they sent planes, they hit the target, and they came back.
Without getting swayed by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole operation and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of confused and big-mouthed, acts of unfailing Obama's Syrian politics.
And the calmest thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Do not be confused by the media's claims that a "Syrian base" or "supply for Hezbalah" has been bombed.
I recently wrote about the fact that while helping the U.S. secular insurgents in the country remains only on rhetorical level, Russia happily continues to deliver the weapons of Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latakia that became the target of the Israeli air strike.
That's a clear message.
And notice, Israel once again bombed Assad's regime, not the insurgent, although it should be the opposite according to popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government has awarded two members of the Sleepy Force, probably Delta Force.
It had no idea that they were distinguished during the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi.
There is a known heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA area in the city, in my opinion, were members of the CIA's secret commando, which is made up of former soldiers.
It's been a long time to speculate what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in another CIA residence.
It's clearer now.
Anyway, the fact that the CIA has its offices protected by machine-gun nests in Libya (just on one such member of the SEALs have perished after being hit by a minimeter) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two unknown heroes.
These were part of the U.S. Commandant in Tripoli, and as soon as they received a report of the Benghazi attack, they volunteered to intervene, and together with five private contractors, they made their way to the CIA complex in Benghazi.
Obama's administration lamented the fact that during that attack the commando was not officially deployed and completely and that it was simply hesitant to do.
The commander, without orders, seems to release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that the country operates not at one time, but permanently the U.S. Commanders, CIA agents and private contractors are quite interesting information.
And that is because until recently nothing like this has officially been confessed, and even now it is just some kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's a good thing the US is trying to combat terrorism in Libya, even if it's half-time.
Although it would take much more help to resolve the national situation.
The last place I want to write about a secret and permanent conflict is the coast of Iran.
It's not that long ago that the media almost sang Iranian air force for prosecution of American drones.
But it is little known how the Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to find your drone in airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
However, if Iranian drones are discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian aircraft F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in an international space above the sea, where perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history occurred.
He flew up on Phantom to optically verify his armor without being registered on the radar, or he just noticed it, and then when he suddenly showed up at his place and called on the Iranian pilot to come home, he wouldn't say a word.
No wonder Phantom is an aircraft of American production, but he remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare to Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful lately, the defenseman or substitute Viktorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form which brought him back to the team after a year.
He's also doing the shooting, the rotting, after the procedure, he was ordered a fine kick in a game in Teplice.
Victoria reached in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after victory, but in the end she took one point out of these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break the unpleasant series in a match against Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a tough match with the North-Caches, who play the attack football.
Everything is heading towards the match with Jablonec, the coach is preparing us well, as we always draw a lot from the video analysis of the game of opponents.
"I believe this is going to be a great game on Friday night," the Czech representative of the fans at Doosan Arena stands out.
The reptiles of the last games didn't come out the way she wanted, but Victoria's word of crisis is rejected.
That's how football works, sometimes you're in good shape, and sometimes worse.
But there's no way I'd talk about a crisis.
"I believe we'll win on Friday, and it'll be good again," says the Westerners' defender.
Once again, the Victoria team will rely on support from fans.
"It's Friday night, and that's what I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe that we will repay them the victory," says Rajtoral.
Jana Péťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step, it's a big jump - a few years back, and it's a memory, until my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash dishes, deluxe and do your homework.
Although these "compulsory" were mostly just theories, parents' wishes.
Practice was completely different - run from school, throw the bag in a corner and run out.
Playing ball games with other kids, jumping shots.
Then on the show Helena and her boys embroidered with a chain stitch a tablecloth for Grandma's birthday.
And then after several warnings finally wash the dishes, deluxe, in winter to apply wood to the tiles and tasks to do until dark under the lamp (or to rely on a schoolmate and instead of the tasks of writing in love the verses addressed to school love).
In the morning, we ate homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not those jams that are being sold now, the content of which was not even lying next to strawberries) and drink it with dried herbs, which my mother and I were so happy to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when the grave silence was in the room when my sister and I were recording radio songs on tapes that were loudly filmed in an old tape recorder after my mom.
And then on the pencil, we rewinded the tapes and kept playing the same song over and over again, our favorite song, and we were toasting it with a siphon.
Or we made a phone call over the table using cans that were tied together with a string - and while we were on the phone to hear better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, the ear was match + watts at the time.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents managed to live out of it in a way that we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones or iPads or even cell phones or laptops or branded clothes.
The clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "cushion" to the wardrobe was a battling t-shirt of domestic production using SAVA.
From electronics, we had enough to satisfy the above mentioned mom's tape recorder and, at most, Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which, by the way, we used only on a train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hop's Hat or Man's Hat, don't be angry, or as I've already said to go "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, and I'm sure my parents had a long time to save for it, but unfortunately, he hasn't been warmed up for a long time.
My younger sister put a sledge in it, said he'd been putting the tapes so beautifully, so she tried to see if she could find a sledge.
Unfortunately, he did, but it was his last bite.
Well, he still has this incident, poor man, on his dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she put a sledge in a video and thought she'd play her recipe and not play it, which is why she still can't bake it.
I remember how we all managed to communicate, talk without a phone, a computer.
My sister and I agreed on vacation at Grandma's house with a neighbor's granddaughter, when we'd meet again next summer at Grandma's - and that's how it was, that's what it was.
We've met.
Promise someone you'll see in a year?!
I also remember the winter when we used to run around with the whole village, build snowmen, ride on a snowy hill by the church on bags stuffed with hay.
Then my family and I had dinner and talked about the last day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear that notorious phrase before dinner: "Let's wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have lemon soap in your bathroom.
After dinner, when my dad was "working" at a beer with Jarda from the village, my mom and I were lying on the floor, leaning on the tile stove, opening the door and looking at the flames and listening to the cracking of wood that was made of stone rope.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social media, we knew how many friends we had, how many real ones!
We've communicated - we've been talking - we haven't written messages every day through different chat rooms, text messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew much more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially if I complete these memories by looking at the albums where the black-and-white photos are carefully glued.
And if I didn't know how old I was then, the back of the photo is always written for a year to take a picture.
I'm looking at the fact that although the cut according to the pot wasn't very nice and we had two bigger numbers on our cousin's pants, no one used to laugh at us, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd better get back that step forward - into reality.
By 2013, and I'll be waiting for what modern times will come up with, maybe once for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me are, for a young teen generation, at least a hundred years behind monkeys, and I think they're losing a lot of it, that they won't live this time either.
I wish they had!
Google, Samsung and Huawei companies sued for Nortel patents
A group that owns thousands of patents lost to Nortel filed an action on Thursday for breach of the patent against mobile phone manufacturers including Google, a company that was auctioned in the context of Nortel's bankruptcy.
Consortium Rockstar, which bought Nortel's $4.5 billion patents, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for breaching the patent at the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of breaking seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps to combine the expressions sought on the Internet with the relevant advertising, the action, which is the core of Google’s search engine business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work on Google Android's operating system that competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a $900 million initial price offer for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and ultimately offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the Nortel patent fight, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partly motivated by Motorola’s patent group.
“In spite of the failure to obtain patents under dispute in the auction, Google has been violating and violating patents,” says the complaint.
Rockstar seeks increased compensation for damage from Google because it considers that Google's patent has been infringed intentionally, as the complaint claims.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
She came from the outside, from four degrees Fahrenheit, which we're not used to yet.
First, she put her smile away, the one who kept showing off as a defense against a friendly environment.
She was so relieved because it was a mask that she decided not to postpone in public.
He was honest at home only on the days of her grandmother and she had the grandchildren of Elinka or Adzika around her.
And of course, when her sons called.
She remembered a lesson from endless business skills courses very well.
Now they're really good.
So she won't grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a costume dress.
November, or another month, she can't do the miracle to smile really, like when they were on a trip with the one who hasn't been here in almost three years.
Egypt appoints the first freely elected president
Muhammad Mursi took the inaugural oath, but his triumphant day will hardly end political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursi promised "new Egypt" when he was solemnly appointed as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husni Mubarak, who was deposed 16 months earlier.
When he was put into office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian Head of State since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges dressed in black plates in a mansion built with a view of the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at a ceremony sent live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer studied in the USA and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been, for the majority of 84 years since its inception, an illegal organisation targeted at the sharp attacks of individual governments.
When Mursi arrived in a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m., hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the courthouse to celebrate the President, and unlike the presidential demonstration of Mubarak’s period, the transport was only briefly stopped so that the column could travel usually through a busy road connecting the city centre with the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Mursi, mocked as the Necharismatic "reservative tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, grew rapidly since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists, but also to all those who want to bring the mutiny to the end of the rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie to the judges in a wooden chamber where he took an oath.
Mursi later traveled to Cairo University to present his inaugural speech.
While he was alert, he received an official welcome from a military band that played a national anthem.
The military commander of the field marshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by a scandal of “armad and the people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s it became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, the place where the revolution was born, which ended the authoritarian government of Mubarak last year, and solemnly promised to take over the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took over them from the exiled leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, rather than before Parliament, as it is customary, he has submitted to the will of the army, which suggests that the fight for power will continue.
Mursi's speech on Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
The ghettos will probably have police specialists to relieve tensions.
Police specialists should operate in ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend half their errands here.
They'd look after order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and people from around them.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior is counting on this.
According to him, the improvement of the situation in the country would mainly help to 'fasten the provision of social housing'.
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, around 300 poor houses and neighborhoods were in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people in them, especially the Roma.
Adults in ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
She was out of her mind.
According to the experts of problem locations, in the meantime, a hundred came in.
The relationship between their residents and others is getting worse.
Anti-Roma marches took place in several places.
The extremists were joined by people from around here.
According to the interior it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in the ghetto areas.
The principle is said to be "consistent application of equal treatment in law enforcement".
But this is said to be impossible to achieve without a detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would be on errands in the ghetto, where he would spend half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he'd be overseeing order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better deal with problems or offenses.
"Thanks to trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a number of infringements," she said.
Experts in ghettos would get extras, 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about EUR 600,000 (now approximately CZK 15.5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15% of the total, funds 85 percent.
The preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being processed.
The project is due to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the authors of the report said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will determine where a special officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release after the end of the project every year.
According to the project proposal, first selected police officers have an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should go through this training each year.
The most suitable candidates will come from them.
It should also create special training for police officers who will operate in ghettos.
According to authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
They say it should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet hostels with precisely defined rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The medium standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard of social housing should be comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to follow up on the integration plan that social workers would draw up with them.
They would have to comply with the rules of residence, care for their health, send children to schools, requalify and actively seek work.
If they tried to integrate, they would advance to a higher standard of housing.
The system of permeable housing should work for at least 30 years, according to the interior, until the next generation grows "in an integratedly motivated environment".
The social housing model prepares ministries for local development and work.
They have to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: The Coal Hill - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The coal hill is a noticeable hill 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Along with several others it is evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Jeseník in the time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last eruptions here were still at the beginning of the quarter.
Looking from a longer distance, the Baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary, built between 1755 and 1765, is visible at the top of the Uhlířska Hill.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn, standing next to the church, did not behave.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley from four lines of Lip, about 1 km long was planted.
The cross road on the Uhlířské vrch is the third version, the original one stood after 1916, the second one, from 2001 it lasted only until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden sculptures made by local art carving artist František Dommel.
He used different kinds of wood from the Low Jeseník region.
Similarly, rocks from the local area form an interesting geological exhibition.
Each stop includes the name of the sponsor.
The carbon top is the rest of a young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric measurements of age varies somewhat, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudny (age 3.3 million years) and older than Venus volcano (age 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born with an explosion.
In doing so, she cast out a large amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the base, which by burning gained red brown color.
At the end of this phase, lava leaked to the surface - today it is a layer of porous brush up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption cast out red, brown red, and places to black tuffees.
Their layer is up to 50 metres powerful and its part is accessible in the quarry wall.
In the tuffees there are visible volcanic pumps of up to 1 metre. The second eruption was finished by the lava spill.
At the end of the activity, lava came out of the volcano, which is now up to 50 m thick layer of a slag-like brush.
The volcanoes in which volcanic ash is cast out with lava outflows are the most common types of volcanoes.
Because they're actually composed of layers, they got the name of a stratovolcana.
The original volcanic cone was subject to gradually erosion.
However, he was threatened by mining rock in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place in 1953 - 1962.
Tuffs were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The pressure of experts and the public has been put to a halt, thus preserving this unique place.
However, the problem is in porousness and small cohesion of the rocks, which are rapidly blowing up, disintegrating and sliding down the slope.
The quarry is disappearing so quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-oriented slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The repair is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
On the Uhlířský vrch you can get to the green tourist mark from Bruntál or from Slezské Kočov.
Automobiles can use free parking at the beginning of the Lip Avenue, where the short learning trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel office.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a tenement villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful villas in Prague in the Nutcracker.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in the restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small vacancy.
So Ivana quickly sought a replacement home for herself and her older mother.
She got a tip on an apartment 3+k in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the vast forest park and the dam moved me to the other side," remembers Ivana at first impression.
At first, I thought it'd be a commission for, like, three years.
"We've been living here for over 13 years today, and I wouldn't change the owner because of a gradual reconstruction," says the owner.
The mother and daughter then moved from a 100 - foot - long apartment to a smaller one with a area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite a good condition, but the necessary adjustments had to take place, such as painting doors or changing windows.
The previous owner demolished the core, but the owner was most concerned with the impractically solved and unnecessary large hall, and on the contrary a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
Architects used to define the individual zones and divide the plasterboard room, which allowed a new location of the lights.
The first hit she decided to take after a few years was the removal of the seat in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room got airy and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step towards partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of PVC floor for laminate.
You didn't know how to use Ivan's bathroom.
For years, I've been collecting housing magazines and searching for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So I approached young architect Kamila Douděrová on my recommendation.
"In fact, this was the most important step in the future," says Ivana.
Thanks to the remodeling of the bathroom it was possible to modify the halls available at the same time.
The architect connected the room of the toilet and the bathroom and two doors with open wings replaced with one sliding, thus saving the space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently barrier-free.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in addition there is a comfortable seat in the shower, a bidet shower at the toilet.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Douděr continued.
As part of the program How to build a dream there was a quick but fundamental change of the living room, which was also attended by architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping to the space, which was created by combining two smaller rooms, without helping with classic principles of optical division, such as semi-crossing or Japanese walls.
"This would, as a result, violate the openness and unity of space," explains the architect.
It was possible to separate the sleeping and living area.
All it took was to turn two sofas to each other and put a custom-made duvet cabinet between them.
The dining area defines the shades of the floor and painting.
On the kitchen floor and the dining area, the architect used a high-quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived the wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchenette covers, if necessary, sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor made of antiallergenic marmoleum has a number of advantages compared to the previous one from laminate: softer non-slip surface without clutches and better sound insulation.
The system of arches and ceilings from the plasterboard highlighted in color is an example of how to work in the panel space.
I left the colors on the architects, I wished it was happy.
"I love orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graphic tiles with the theme of the flowered magnolia are practical and create a significant aesthetic element.
The warm, energetic tone was chosen by architects in white, which underlined the modern functional style.
The small apartment managed to store books, among other things, into space under window windows sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance.
The new contrast with the older ones works perfectly in the remodeled interior, for example with the old crystal mirror and high-quality objects that Ivana collects for her entire life.
The last kitchen came in.
The lockers were previously placed on both sides and the owner felt a little bit like a tunnel.
The architect took their number and postponed the deployment.
The furniture in simple design is custom-made, white area softens slightly pearly surface.
Thanks to the creative solution of the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher, fit into a small space.
In view of the small kitchen, he revived the whole glass lining of the walls over the workboard.
The unique graphic design with digitally printed motif is attractive, and it is excellently maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolia, which remind her of her favorite neighborhood, where she lived for years.
She seems happy here, too, now.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and washbasin, the new owner chose a neutral shade of the lining.
The big shower has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to create from a given environment a clear simple space in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
The interior is materially and colorfully unified and tried to make its elegant, cozy, not overcrowded appearance.
"Another condition of the award was a barrier-free solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the achievability of everyday items," adds Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court has ruled: No time can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can also be prosecuted for possible crimes that he could have committed before the August dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
On the other hand, in the case of former ODS Members Ivan Fuxi, Mark Šnajdra and Petr Tluchora, he decided that they could not be punished for any criminal offence until last November, until they gave up their parliamentary mandate, said the spokesperson of the Supreme Court, Petr Knötig.
The Court of First Instance rejected, by this decision, the application of State Prosecutor Iv Ištvan, who wanted to continue criminal proceedings with Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in the adoption of laws.
On the contrary, the former Prime Minister who offered them these posts can also be prosecuted.
With Wim Bart, they also arrested an anti-corruption police officer.
Bart's attorney, Oldřich Chudoba, who represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV Members, also refused to comment too much on the case, but he said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but with the protection of classified facts I cannot comment on it any further."
According to the rights of the case, the General Security Corps (GIBS) is being inspected.
Server tn.cz said that Bart was able to buy classified information from the police.
According to the first-report server.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment Bart allegedly sought.
However, recent information on the Rights shows that the detention of Vít Barta is unrelated to Peter Lessy.
The spokesperson of the police presiding Eva Kropáčová refused to comment on the case being dealt with by the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," Štěpánka Zenklová said on Friday.
That is where the plaintiff oversees Bart's case, and its words indirectly indicate that the file or criminal proceedings are carried out under the covert procedure.
The reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vít Barta Kateřina Klasnová in the morning before their stay in Prague Klárov.
She was loading the trunks in the car and she was leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, Bart's detention was expressed by the leader of the Dawn Tomio Okamura movement.
According to his words, he has no idea what the case is.
"Viet Bart was one of many candidates for our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy by Tomia Okamura," he added.
In the past early elections to the Chamber in the Pilsen Region, Bart was unsuccessfully running for the Dawn movement of direct democracy, Tomia Okamura, is known for his corruption case of the bribery of Members of the Public Matters.
In April 2012, he was incompetently sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Then the sentence was changed and Bart was acquitted.
I want a contract at the NHL.
I still have juice, lust and enthusiasm
The family has always been the first place for Prospal, so he wants to submit to it at 38 years of age.
Either he gets a job overseas, and he's going to extend his career, or he's going to end up hockey.
"I want to play the role of Daddy and Husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says the hockey player who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Even though he's a famous worker who'll never fool anything.
Even though he always leaves his heart on the ice, he can tear down his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player in the last season at Columbus.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," she reports determinedly.
He may find himself, allegedly, in New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season and have two injured resistances - the attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like to come to the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on paper, there's no point dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that's all.
It was never added that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
Haven't you heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place daily.
That's where it's going to get into a situation where this contract really comes in.
When a player gets hurt, or someone gets hurt, and a manchaft doesn't work.
There are a lot of different factors that need to be put together to get the contract.
But there are similar circumstances in New York, aren't there?
The wounded are Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan, and the team didn't come out in the season, so there's a chance there is, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The other thing is, you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, expecting something to go wrong?
I've had those expectations since July 5th, when the NHL opened up the free-player market, and still nothing.
Going to New York to remind you?
No, I'm going to Tampa to see my kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
It's because I'm a father and a husband and everything depends on it.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna be a dad and a husband, and I'm looking forward to it.
As early as Sunday, your hockey game has two games, it's a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go support our kids in what they want to do.
Are you thinking about doing this in full-time quotation marks?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
Even this can happen.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it so much.
One day, it gets to such a stage that all goals, winnings, and passes won't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me except my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play the NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, sports success is also the first place - apart from family.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life depends on.
My children, I'm sorry, our children - mine and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school and so on.
And we would love to see them continue in this trend.
Because what we're going to talk about is there are possibilities in America somewhere else.
We should offer them a chance.
So you're planning on staying in America permanently?
We're gonna practice it like we're doing until now.
This means that in the summer we will be in Bohemia on Hluboká and in the surroundings of České Budejovice.
And in the winter again in Tampa or where our steps lead us.
It's perfect to keep warm.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say I went across the street from him, it cost him a lot of strength and abstinence, and it took a lot of things I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That we can choose where we're going to live with a woman.
There's a lot of people in the world who want this stuff so they can choose what they're gonna do and how they're gonna live.
How long will you have at your age the will to work hard, train hard, and wait for the offer?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how much longer it'll stay there.
You can't plan that.
So you could say that this season you're gonna wait for it to turn out, and then you're gonna decide what's next?
I'm in a phase where I go day by day.
Recently, the Director-General of ČEZ announced that the decision to build the 3rd and 4th blocks of the Temelín power plant was postponed at the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified it by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and consenting Contracts of difference by the government.
With these reasons, the current management of ČEZ tries to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. to the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should make recommendations to shareholders, not hide behind them.
The government only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his movement YES will not have time to learn a political craft in opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government in order to create one at all.
The President has admitted it in an interview for the Law, which will come out tomorrow.
The trade and marketing of ŠkoFIN is led by Abrahamek

The SkoFIN was established in 1992.
Police evacuated part of Los Angeles airport for shooting.
There were shootings at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
The police evacuated part of the airport, reportedly three of them were terminals.
Agent Reuters, appealing to California media, claims that law enforcement men have been shot with a gun of armed men.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to the police, said there was a firefight that injured two or three members of the Traffic Safety Administration.
How many people have been injured, and whether or not there are any victims, but it's still not obvious.
Fire department's talking about an event with more people injured.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The goal was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
On Thursday, Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombarded a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia.
With the appeal to the unappointed agent of the U.S. government, CNN announced it.
The Israeli press widely reported the explosion at the alleged warehouse of missiles, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack on it.
When asked by CNN, an Israeli spokesperson refused to comment on the raid.
"We do not comment on the reports of foreign media," she said.
According to the U.S. government source of missiles and related equipment, which the Israelis believe could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP with appeals to another US security agent reported that the target of the Israeli air strike on the Syrian territory were Russian missiles SA-125.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian anti-air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area, however, according to DPA, showed the battery of Russian missiles type S-125 Neva.
In addition, the SA-3 batteries were also seen on them, including a command center with a missile tracking radar and their targets.
According to the Israeli television report, the missiles recorded range 35 kilometres [35 km] and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms [70 kg].
Israel has been bombarded at least twice this year by the supply of missiles inside Syria, reported CNN and AP.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly claimed to interfere with any shipment of weapons intended for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to have successfully resisted this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic pre-tax profit to be between USD 325 and 340 million compared to USD 305 to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a twelve to seventeen percent increase compared to the record profit of USD 290.4 million in 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an eight percent profit in the first half of the year, and the second half started with a sharp growth mainly in Australian and British travel outside the service.
"To date today, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards a record annual profit before interest and taxation," he said.
This is Australia and the United Kingdom, which is traditionally our biggest profitmakers.
Business with recreational activities increased during the second half of Australia, which compensates for a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
America’s trade has recovered after the loss during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to bring a third year-round profit.
Flight Centre’s shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at USD 38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September due to protest against planned oil production in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St Petersburg.
Today the AFP Agency informed about this with an appeal to the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.
At the same time, she claims that the original charges against her pirate activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the oil platform in the Arctic were transported from the Murmansk detention facility to the St Petersburg prison," she announced in her statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, this was a planned transfer.
Ecological authorities first accused them of piracy, for which, in case of conviction, up to 15 years of prison was threatened.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace these charges with more minor riots for which a lower sentence with a maximum sentence of seven years in prison is at stake.
But in today's statement, Greenpeace has pointed out that piracy charges have not been dropped yet, as promised.
I hear that means that arrests are now charged with two crimes.
The High Committee of Investigation announced last week that the piracy charges would be replaced by a charge of harassment.
But when the 30 prisoners were brought before the committee this week, the charges of piracy were not dropped.
Instead, new charges were made against everyone," Greenpeace quoted AFP.
In mid-September, three dozen members of the Greenpeace movement, originating in 18 countries, were detained by the Russians at the Gazprom oil platform.
The environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship flying the Dutch flag.
Since then, they've all been held in custody against which they've filed appeals, but the court has rejected them all.
On terms of imprisonment, environmentalists complain.
According to AFP, the Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo said today that moving to St Petersburg will facilitate meetings with families and consular workers.
However, there is no guarantee that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansko.
"In fact, they may be worse," he pointed out.
King Willem-Alexandra of the Netherlands asked for help from one of Faiza Oulahsen's detainees.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch invited him to speak about their situation during a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It states that Malika has a large part in restoring sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of the fighting in neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, at least one Shakespeare game, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and the current British fiction will have to be studied.
The test will also include a "hidden text" to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English literature courses and languages will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to have a senior exam in their language and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue new curriculums for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first courses to undergo radical change.
For other essential subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Ofqual office, which oversees the graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is “a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our test system in order to regain the confidence of society” and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation test be “more demanding, more ambitious and stricter”.
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison of schools in Australia, mathematics spends an average of 143 hours a year and Singapore about 138 hours a year.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have stated that a comprehensive mathematics exam – along with greater emphasis on this subject in the scoreboards – will probably encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The learning plan will focus more on “the problems of the real world”, including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, a long-sinking dispute between two wings fighting for influence inside Ostrava's ČSSD was incinerated.
It all culminated when Mayor Petr Kajnar turned to court because of the undemocratic assembly of the candidates.
The causation activists did not want to express themselves too much to harm the party even more before the elections.
But now the voters are numbered.
The management of Ostrava's ČSSD called on Mayor Ostrava on Monday evening to step out of the party, and it will seem to push for him to lose his job.
But Petr Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What's going on and who's on the side, he described in an exclusive interview for the diary.
How do you see the outcome of the elections?
I'm sure the ČSSD was counting on a much better result.
Did it harm her in our country that before the elections there were disputes in the media inside the party?
I imagine that social democracy could have a better electoral outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now in.
It's a party that has internal problems, is internally ill, and people feel it's not all right in it.
They made it clear in the elections.
What are the internal diseases of the ČSSD?
I think that ODS has been going through bankruptcy for some time now, and unfortunately, things like that are happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their prebends at the ODS, moved to and influenced the people in the ČSSD.
It is related to the fact that the offices of the Ostrava Magistrate are followed by the police and collected computers.
It shows that the ČSSD is not only made up of people who would like the good of all others, but many of them are primarily thinking about their good.
The ČSSD is divided into two inconclusive camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between Haškovce and Sobotkovice.
Even so, it's been preparing for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a premonition of what is happening now in Prague.
Haškov's wing gradually occupied its positions so that, after the elections, it could trigger a situation that would weaken Sobotkov's wing.
One is in politics in a situation where one has to take compromises at times.
But everyone has an internal border where the compromises can no longer be made, and that's my case.
Originally, I didn't want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaoralka that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotk's wing as Mayor of Ostrava.
But Hask's wing gave it a stop.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michal Hask?
In my opinion, the famous Sobotka is a person who always talks about the ČSSD programme and to some extent about visions for the party and for this country.
I confess, on the other hand, I didn't hear anything like it.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can simply appeal to the President of the Party.
This is a struggle for power regardless of all and against the statutes of the Party.
In my opinion, Michal Hašek has now completed his political career in Prague.
How did you feel about not being approved by the Ostrava leadership of the ČSSD?
The political parties are based on the competition, who will be placed among their members.
The competition should largely be based on program visions and on the ability of these people to fulfill these visions.
Of course, however, there are also people who do not have much skills or visions, but the political party is for them an elevator for money that they would not have received elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start to get ahead by breaking the rules without scruples, they break the laws of the party.
They are making the mafia their practice, and I think they are also violating the laws of the Czech Republic.
It is more important for me to draw attention to this problem than to consider whether Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
So, before the elections, did you submit a motion for a preliminary measure against the form of a candidate for the ČSSD in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava strengthens its power by gradually throwing out uncomfortable members of the party.
One example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarik from the representative club, but he brought an action against it, and then they dismissed the decision on his exclusion.
This shows that it is the last option to seek compliance with the statutes of the party through the courts, but at the moment when the other methods and control bodies within the ČSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The attempt to lead Ostrava's ČSSD with Member Adam Rykala is to withdraw you from the position of mayor.
It's a public secret that Mayor Poruba Lumír Palyza has an interest in this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can so they can call me off.
They promise people positions, get votes, and then they put their power on the side for those votes.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the ball club Banik Ostrava and the purchase of the Basel stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could label me as a man who puts money where it doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city bought assets that were strategically of great value to it.
How, then, do you continue to see this as a mayor with your stamina?
The District Committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our continuing in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Catch the thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the past eleven years, I do not see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy who would initiate and enforce, sometimes even against the members of the party, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of a scientific and technological park.
Yet everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it any different than I'm preventing others from going through the places they want.
Are you going to fight these efforts any further?
Because if this republic is to work well, then political parties must work well.
I find it hard to believe that any side of the country will be able to drive the state effectively if it can't even drive itself.
So I'm not thinking about leaving the ČSSD now, because I think whoever causes cancer on this side is not me, but these people who are trying to get me off.
Olomouc will open a public rink in the historical centre
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas Markets and Winter Skating Pavel Spalý stated that the preparatory work on the ice rink started on 26 October and the aggregate for ice production was in operation from Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The ice rink has an area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
The skaters and passers will also have two punch stands.
"We expanded the floor area, increased the space before the stands, and almost the entire area of the podia is covered so that skaters can easily move," he described.
The streets of Olomouc are already resembling the coming Christmas.
Last year, the rink was installed right in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer so that the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could have gone right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice surface then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
Christmas markets, which are part of a rich cultural programme, will be launched on the Upper Square one month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlín will again be solved by a county court
The Regional Court acquitted the prosecutions of the 25-year-old Slovak and the 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men rejected the guilt.
They're facing 15 to 20 years of prison or even exceptional punishment.
The spokesman, Petr Angyaloshy, confirmed that the Supreme Court had abolished the decision of the County and returned the matter to him for discussion.
The reasons which led the judge to do so refused to comment on the fact that the decision has not yet been served on the parties.
According to the prosecution, the young men assaulted a seventy-seven-year-old man in his house.
Senior died of agony.
According to the prosecution, the men strangled him, beat him, and kicked him all over the body, and the metal object, probably with a gas gun, put about three dozen wounds in his head.
A man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures of the cranial bone, swelling of the brain, or bleeding into the brain that he had given up at the site.
The youngsters reportedly took some 3,000 crowns and some 14,000 crowns of jewelry from the house.
According to the Regional Court, they were the only, in addition only indirect, evidence against the defendant's scented footprints, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
While the smell marks from the crime scene and other things were consistent with the defendants in more than ten cases, the police initially treated them as physical and not scented footprints.
In addition, there was some error in handling them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants has not been proven without doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought he'd fallen and injured himself.
Not even a call - for - rescue doctor pointed out violent deaths.
After a few days, the criminals contacted the broken doctors who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the leads from the crime scene that relatives cleaned up.
No defendant's DNA was found on the scene.
Mladý Slovák lived in Uherskohradiště.
He is now serving a fine of 8.5 years, which was confirmed last year by a powerful Olomouc Supreme Court.
The man, according to him, was the head of an organized group of six young men who were responsible for a robbery of the jewelry store.
The robberies occurred in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopna.
The younger of the accused of murdering a senior lives in the Uherský Hradiště.
In August, after 11 months, the court released him from custody.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojma.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by constructionists who would reconstruct the lawn.
The reconstruction of the urban stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages in order to meet the standards for the first football league.
The living legend Wayne Shorter will close next week's Fall Strings
The saxophone velvet and the legend of the Wayne Shorter jazz scene will do the next Wednesday of the 18th Autumn String Festival.
Shorter will perform in the Grand Hall of Lucerna together with his quartet in the composition of Danilo Perez, John Pattucci and Brian Blade on November 6.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by the spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older songs Lotus and Prometheus Unbound, will play in Shorter's modifications for the symphony orchestra.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, which proves that the Prague concert on the Strings of Autumn will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music over 60 years ago.
The list of artists he worked with dates from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitous and Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than one decade they gave direction to a new fusion style.
For the past 13 years, he has performed especially with Wayne Shorter Quartet.
Some afterparty after the festival will be a club night Spotlight, which will take place on 9th November at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triany, the Manchester Trio Go Penguin will present its jazz-inspired electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the Profound Bass electro-jazz formation inspired by dance styles.
They say that UEFA prohibits the publication of penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, Chairman of the Committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing penalties for barrels.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, which she stated in an interview for the daily Law.
Otherwise, the FAČR would be threatened with sanctions.
Damková also rejected the fact that she would side with the football players of Pilsen from where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but other members of the committee are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in case of vote I can lose 1:6," said Damková in response to criticism, which got angry after Plzeň recently played twice as much penalty as the other league teams.
Thus, although in recent months the FAČR has stopped publishing penalties for the referee, Damková assures that they are suing for their mistakes.
"Trust me that if the panel finds out that the referee made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, whatever the game was," said Damková.
According to Damek, the reason why the penalties are not published is because of the European Union's ban on football.
"The EUFA prohibits the publication of such information and punishes the violation."
"We're very suspicious here, and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have made the restrictions public, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, there will be severe sanctions," said Damková.
The other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she said.
If the publication of the information continues, the Commission may lose money from UEFA on the education and development of the referees.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we could not fulfil the program in the training of referees," said Damková.
Barta's arrest is related to Janušek and Bém: Is she behind the wiretap?
The police arrested the President of the Public Affairs of Vít Bart on Thursday.
Jan Petržílek, Head of the Anti-Corruption Police Department, was arrested with him.
The detention is related to the wiretaps of the lobbyist Roman Janousek and former Mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the wiretaps with which the server Novinky.cz came, confirmed a reliable source to the Czech Press Office.
The phone calls received by Janousek and Bém, which were published last March by the daily Mladá Fronta Today, in which both men address each other "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík", show Janousek's influence on the city's steps under the Bem's leadership.
The daily reported that it was purchased in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later they escaped to the ABL Security Agency.
That's when Bart owned it.
Server Novinky.cz pointed out that the detained criminal Petržílek was working for the BIS just before he joined the anti-corruption police.
Petržilek went to the anti-corruption section, which was subsequently involved in the wiretaps, at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all," said the prosecutor Michal Muravský from the Municipal State Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six companies out of ten are preparing for the new Civil Code
The upcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act since 1 January 2014 has been intensively preparing six companies out of ten.
Only eight percent of the companies questioned said that they had no solution to matters related to the two key codes in their society.
This results from a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the upcoming period of effectiveness of both key codes, a number of managers are beginning to realize at the very last minute what can have a significant impact on the business of their companies.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the politicians' avalanche, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether or not the revolutionary changes will eventually take place.
"Now, however, they only have a few weeks left so that the transition to a new right takes place for their companies without complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively dealing with the new laws, 26 percent said that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to prepare them in time.
In addition, 35 percent of the companies in this number are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, every fifth company has not yet dealt with the recodifications, yet it has a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and can't judge the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that the recodification issues have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent), the solution of the business conditions (16 percent) and the changes in the property catastro and the liability for damage (ten percent).
The contracts will take place one of the most important innovations of the entire recodification, namely the unification of the adjustments to the contracts only under the new Civil Code.
The current parallel arrangement in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, and as a result contract law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adaptation will offer many new products with an emphasis on greater freedom of arrangement of relations," said the lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddaný.
In the context of the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of the statutory authorities to be the most important topic.
The following are the topics related to the changes in the convening and the general meeting (15 percent) and the company's representation (14 percent).
The new legislation means tightening up the obligations and possible consequences for the statutory authorities, in particular in situations where companies are at risk of bankruptcy or getting into bankruptcy.
"In practice, this means that if members of the board and directors of companies do not deal with the care of a good economy and do not reverse the imminent bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit of the function only in the last two years," Spáčil added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to make Cartier's style develop as a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition and at the same time to lead our brand to modern things, so that it does not remain dusty relics, explains in an interview for HN Pierre Rainero, a style director at Cartier.
This French luxury house was founded in 1847.
Travels through the mud, river and jungle and provides medical care for free
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not too many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one out of 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates for the 2013 CNN Hero Prize.
In the 2013 CNN Prize Competition, you can vote for it or any of the ten main candidates.
The winner will get $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde.
First, he was only treated with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain and created a hematoma that caused him problems his whole life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwell.
You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., hurry to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people only die because they have to wait.
The situation hasn't changed much since Bwell's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonians could visit, many could not afford it.
Two of the five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the health care expenditure in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed free of charge last year, 700 operations.
He became a vascular surgeon himself at a central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded a nonprofit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas where they provide free medical care on the weekend.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped with their volunteer group.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people get stuffed in supplies, attach to the roofs of medical needs, and travel through rough terrain to villages that need help.
They're not always accompanied by happiness.
Often vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome as real heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is indeed a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with his wide smile and unrestrained energy – is very eagerly involved in local cheers.
The next day, the team is starting to treat hundreds of patients.
"There are 500 patients on every trip," says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or a free birth certificate – a document that requires school, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team is doing a simple surgery under local anesthesia.
The surgery is usually done in the school building, in the city hall or at home; after surgery the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to release the seat to another patient.
Using the light from the generator, the operating room and Bwelle hygiene equipment and its volunteers work early in the morning.
It's exhausting, but the village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay awake and continue to work, they play drums all night," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroon’s doctors and foreign students of medicine, carried out 700 free operations last year and realized that their help could mean a lot to local residents.
One man said that after surgery, he'd be able to work again.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works for private health clinics around Yaounde.
He says that this second work is financed by about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest are covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who's a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, and is a volunteer for Bwelle's group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We washed hands and removed blood stains or held instruments for Dr. Bwell," says O'Malley.
That's like a second-grade medical student in America you'll never experience.
Students usually pay their way to Cameroon by themselves and often arrive with donated medical needs.
But as soon as they arrive at Yaounde, the diet, transport and study provide them with Bwelle.
"He is no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
Bwell's constant denial is not a burden.
To help others live happier, to fulfill the promise that he has made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," says Bwell.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
Make people laugh, ease their pain – that's why I do it.
Take a look at ASCOVIME's website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát renewed the position of Chief Sister for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I consider it essential for this function to be clearly defined and formalised so that nurses should have their representatives within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always contact if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses, and I think that the nursing industry deserves to be given due attention even from the Ministry.
The exercise of this profession requires not only high professionalism, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"Rad and with all responsibility I will try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skillful sisters in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who, by their approach to patients, do not help us to perform their calling with all empathy and help us to improve the image of sisters in the public's eyes," says Alena Šmídová.
Alena Šmídová, a newly appointed nurse for the Czech Republic on the occasion of her appointment, also stated that she wanted to address various aspects of the nurse's position and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"In principle, I do not want to separate the profession of doctors and sisters, but on the contrary I see them standing next to each other, with each one having his or her competence, and together with other health professionals he or she forms a team of professionals who provide health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I myself face a number of problems that occur in the profession of sisters, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in solving them."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my experience that some of the nurse's administrative actions make it unnecessary to burden them with time that could and should devote to patients," Alena Šmídová says.
Other areas which it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better work together in the team and managing healthcare providers, adapting competences as well as labour issues such as compliance with the labour code or not overloading the sisters with their insufficient numbers at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous trails which, however, are not documented on a specific case where violations of the rules could occur because of concerns of possible punishment.
"Where the plaintiff is not, there is no judge, so the function of the Chief Sister of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of the anonymity of such complaints and allow the competent authorities to examine a particular case," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Medical School in the field of Health Nurse (a graduate in 1978) and from the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague in the study programme of Pedagogy - Pedagogy (a graduate in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been the head of the department of nursing and other non-medical disciplines and the recognition of qualifications in the department of education and science.
During her professional career, she worked as a sister at the bedside in the internal department, and continued to be a teacher at the secondary medical school, where she was also a statutory assistant director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009, she served as the main sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several specialist textbooks in nursing and articles in specialist journals, devoted herself to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
She's not a member of any political party.
So I don't get stuck with hate
After 12 years, writer Václav Kahuda returned to write.
After long years of reading, he lived but did not write, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) published a new novel Wind, dark, presence.
The number of parties compared to his most famous piece of Houstina (Petrov, 2001) points out that it will not be an entangled volume.
For Salon Kahuda was confessed by another prominent Czech writer today - Emil Hakl.
What happened after 12 years of silence to write a novel?
I did it so I wouldn't get caught up in hate.
Seeing new and new clones around you of this human foolish pettyness, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
I don't even talk about us elders, faces ruined by powerless lusts, vexlac souls, and vice versa-spoiled ideologists, who try to sell their "product" with the expression of a small sales whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my Jubilee friends, freaks, and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I can feel my brain burning out of my life on this planet.
I like to go for walks, and then I read a book at my lampstand tonight.
You're talking about a sense of waste, of hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old like all of us?
A break came back a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, that's what I lived for.
There's a still-surprising silent boy in there somewhere.
I see other lone trainers, everyone in their tornado of anxiety.
It saved me from writing books.
I'm going to participate in this vast, thousand-year-old movement of the system of life on this planet - the ripple of the incomprehensible future.
This vast, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is a direct heir to our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game, when the way of experimenting-myl creates another generation of beings, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artistic intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-speak, or rather, a dialogue that leads the right and left half of the brain, sometimes flows to the surface and forms itself into a book.
Like a period of peace intertwined with quietly sleeping metastases of wars, which may one day wake up - so my book is 12 years of silence dressed in words.
I felt a mute avalanche of my life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day, I'm gonna be quietly hit.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated and put them on layers that are stored in the dark "under the level of consciousness".
Neortex, a gray brain cortex, asks for older evolutionary formations, goes to ancient circles of the brain tree.
He talks to the haired beasts, asks the snakes, searches for an answer in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the star sky above me.
In the end, the brain is asking the world.
Relatively, you express yourself metaphorically to the ego - can you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that man has experienced.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branching information trees, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognizable, cognitive, process, being exposed to constantly changing presence, in a firm effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes overload disorders occur.
Analogically - as if you had "fallen" PC, from the program of speech emulator and translator from foreign languages you would first get caught up in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few unsuccessful restarts ended with a dark green-eyed bios screen, in a basic system that controls functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we're talking about, I'm talking about a psychotic crisis.
You talk about her a lot - why are you regularly interested in this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the so far functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a hole appears.
Here it is good to find Nietzsche: "So long he looked into the abyss until the abyss looked into him."
A pure feeling - that a person is lost if all hope disappears, mentally "death" and a new quality occurs.
And why do I care personally?
I will answer with a parable.
Once a man fell in the shade and drowned, ran days, months and years, he kept drowning and reading, and those books taught him how to swim - that is, live.
He became a diver.
Perhaps a sentence written by me will help someone, just as the texts of the Hrabal helped me.
To what extent do you think of a reader, a particular person who will read your text?
One who cannot be told anything meaningful is called consciousness, another super ego, but I think Arthur Rimbaud was best characterized in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of word and sentence formulation."
From early on, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nem's submarine, running around the Shadowes in dark alleys.
In the end, behind all the branching of the authors and their message, the sun reads, "The bright worlds of the other Karl Hynek Mácha".
And if there's a book out there?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
A retro-reflection that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who will take CZK 300 and are willing to read 500 pages of the text.
And then, maybe years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some tough life decision.
Books are actually "lifes" or better said "worlds".
They are encoded into the characters of the letters, they bear the experience, the history of the regions of the language.
Whenever we can wake them to life if we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden from God - to awaken other and other life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is stored in lines - according to the old demonological books, we do witchcraft.
After publishing the book you – as it is often – expects a string of authorial readings.
I remember you used to like reading.
Are you happy to do it again, or are you feeling it differently after years?
I'd rather talk about it today.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they're inconspicuous, they don't warn themselves, they have friendly radiation, you don't feel alone with them.
Let me give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived (and I hope he still lives) one curly bookstore (named conveniently July), a cheerful friend and a good girl bull.
In one drink, he presented me with individual articles from the readers of my book Houstina.
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown a bold, read copy of my book.
I was embarrassed to put away just a tearful morning, and wept briefly for a man.
We were all standing there, snooping and crying drunkly with the milking.
Then the young blonde blender couldn't stand it, and with a scream he jumped out of the window into the snow.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night country and slaughtered with a happy rabies of sensitive people, a painful soul of countrymen and a path of fallen patriots - poured out and hurled as werewolves until the morning.
Every book of yours is both formally and physically different from the one before.
Does this also apply to the text of the Wind, the dark, the present?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchol puts the words of an old Russian myth in the mouth of the folk healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog, a gray chest on it.
Horrible, scary, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps we were devils in hell a long time ago and drew - what role we would play in this country.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to let it go again on an influx of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, like the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depth and in so wide that it goes beyond our horizon - and so we do with absolute certainty precisely in the intentions of our programmed task.
We're being rewarded by an inflow of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, die in defence and in the acquisition of new personal territories.
Sometimes a malfunction happens and we exude compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the coast of the ocean unconscious, and the leaks made of dirty handkerchief are caught by tides of wet wind.
I have to write to be human.
Obama steps away from health care
After the critique wave, President Obama resigned yesterday from his often repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health program, you can keep it".
With reference to hundreds of thousands of notices of resignations from Republican service providers in recent days, the president has been accused of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday Obama's original promise has been knocked.
“The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep them,” he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called the “ media launch” of the statements, Obama called on the Americans who received these announcements to search for new insurance policies on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration claims that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the scheme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on Available Care.
"I say this to these Americans: you deserve better," Sebelius said in her statement to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Act on Available Care, said that the start of the Internet market went "poor" since October.
"I am disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
The irritable Sebelius, which was captured by the microphone, spoke yesterday towards a consultant sitting behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a member of Missouri, about whether she herself had to participate in Obama's care program.
For more than three hours during his hearing at Sebelius, he repeatedly asked why the "architect" of the Available Care Act did not voluntarily give up funded insurance by the government and did not buy a program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you be talking to next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy operator O2.
The two companies confirmed the meeting and according to various sources from agencies and from behind-the-scenes, the hand is already in the sleeve.
The transaction should be announced in November, probably before the start of the LTE auction, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor, Karel Komárek, owns the KKCG group.
Under the brand Sazka Telecommunications launched the auction of frequencies for the LTE networks.
And to a general surprise, until then, there was no mention of the company's desire to enter telecommunications.
But Sazka is now running a very experienced telecommunication man Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing boss of Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), then became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and was the last to head the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka is playing a few cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she admits she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafone's.
And it makes sense.
If the auction succeeds, it will be able to transfer existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
That would probably not like Vodafone under normal circumstances, but according to Hospodářského noviny, this can be part of a much narrower cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from an agreement between competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the LTE tender (as a rookie can auction specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to participate in the auction at all, or he will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there is not enough frequency for all).
Vodafone can share the nets with Sazka.
Vodafone releases the Bag into its 2G/3G network (respectably the newly built LTE network at the frequency of 900 MHz), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
In the meantime, it will start to build a expensive LTE network that Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Saveable money could then be spent by Vodafone for a fixed Internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy the Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of the Czech) immediately gained a full operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, he's a big pier that'll be waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would get Kellner already behind the O2 and very likely in collaboration with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that the networks will share.
The auction could finally end in success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calls with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will the Czech Television ever do without signatures?
President Zeman's era has entered the legendary scene with an ashtray, so it's not hard to listen to complaints that collect documents about the castle type.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Hardík was not documented in this way, let alone signed under it.
True, the editors stood up for the management.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where such a favorability of some journalists comes from - whether it is a direct order response or, in order not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of inappropriate empathic support.
And if we are to assume universal wickedness, we cannot forgive the question of whether other, no less unscrupulous, power - minded interests that have not yet been given an opportunity to change the circumstances on television.
Those who say that there are no attempts to intervene politicians in advanced countries have the truth.
However, the truth is that this does not mean that there are no complaints about public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they mainly criticise what they consider to be a tendency that is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stage yet and this situation isn't there.
But perhaps also in a country that thinks it's the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about bad politicians and good journalists spend more comfortably than more complicated descriptions of an opaque situation where many imperfect human beings encounter each other.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: Presidents on the verge of force
It is almost a rule that, in the key moments of the country, the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfil its national obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidential period, and events around Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after the symbolic resistance, the air force could fly abroad, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London immediately and not fight there laboriously for their legitimacy.
And most of all, the capitulation would not give the nation hangover to this day.
Benes was not a statesman, and he was still fit for Munich, but in the war it started to go downhill with him and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
Being a little better, he could have gone out for the third time and broken the legitimacy of the communists and their coups.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
He was elected to "Mr. President's not gonna get into a situation where he'd make a decision."
But he had to, although the big decision was not with a knife on his neck at Hitler's chancellor.
The secretary of intelligence František Moravec has been telling in the last days of March 1939 what should be done to keep the occupation, which he knew exactly for the day, from the Germans so smoothly and with such profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, and they were afraid.
The human ruin of Gottwald had his old companions executed, as Moscow commanded him.
Ludvík Svoboda has definitely made it impossible to take part in normalization and have had to take it down, already completely senile.
That Husak was powerless and a sick depressing old man in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only thing.
Havel was lucky that he hadn't been met in the office in the last few years, and he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis senior, but many of his actions make him realize that the mental processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, here's what we've got.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces look like he's looking, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic now.
Or maybe it's a threat, it's just not visible.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, the president is not quite strong (in historical terms).
But it's not a normal state.
Couldn't we be the president of this country again once again with acceptable thinking and acceptable health?
Remote planets, black and white films, or a little fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that an American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw up on in any way.
In the concept of his quartet, which in the large hall of Prague Lucerna will complete this year's String Festival, everything is related to everything.
The quartet of the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the current feeling of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are to play what they're experiencing.
They treat music as a completely improvized chamber matter and think not of harmony or rhythm, but of film images.
But this principle is a freshly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, bearer of nine Grammys, former teammate of Miles Davis and today apparently the largest living jazz saxophonist - he does not like to explain.
He does not speak much of music, even though his overall view of music is closely related.
At the age of eighty, I found it best to be surprised with my life.
"A lot of people are planning everything, and then they're disappointed when things develop differently," Shorter says.
How Insects From Thailand Raise Sales of the Paris Bar
Maybe you're grinning over an insect and you don't know that you're eating it half a kilo a year.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you also have a unique experience taken care of.
He placed the insect offer first in Paris on the menu of his business at the beginning of October Elie Daviron, cook and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
A bar whose name was inspired by the book William Burroughs Naked lunch, you would find in a fashionable 18th district near Montmartre a generously visited tourist.
With fresh avocados, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, the guests can now eat not only different larvae, grasshoppers or water bugs, but also taste scorpions.
Carefully and specially packaged supplies (so that insects do not harm their wings, harm their legs or damage their eyes) send Davir out of Thailand.
Europe is only learning how to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of a Parisian bar with a pioneer menu gives a number of reasons to consume insects.
The first is the ecological benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (as regards finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"Moreover, the insect is an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," said Daviron for Reuters Station.
At the same time, a young cook does not deny his profession, simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes the right pleasure, a sense of sin, and an atmosphere.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just providing a new experience," he explained.
Far from everyone would be delighted to know how to consume a bug decorated with a pest, but according to the owner, the customer's reaction to a served insect bar in Paris is very positive.
Even skeptics are said to finally taste the bite, even when they start with the smallest bites and then they finally pick a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: The new green savings should continue
Czech construction has been confronted with a continuous decrease in the volume of contracts since 2008 and the state has not been interested in dealing with the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the programme The new green savings was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after implementing the measures, will save considerable amounts for heating, but also for construction companies and construction companies.
Every billion invested will bring more than 2700 newly created jobs to the state.
In terms of fiscal policy, the leverage and multiplier effects are significant, and they are also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The association of entrepreneurs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic therefore strongly disagrees with the resolution of the government and asks for the implementation of such steps as would allow the continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be launched within it.
LAW, 1 November 2013
The dog summed up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up with crutches.
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on a bed, and left for the castle in Lány.
What medical condition is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry pointed out that the US's defence attitude about its surveillance programs had been reduced, and in an unprecedented confession he said that in some cases spying has "been too far".
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for treating him as a "autopilot" in view of the angry revelation of the NSA spy activity that appeared thanks to informer Edward Snowden.
The published information triggered a diplomatic storm between the US government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, through a video-connection at an open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the President and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that have been done out of the stamina, because this possibility was, with reference to the Second World War, a difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, September 11."
So he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage crossed the border, but stressed that it had not been violated by anyone's rights.
He said: “In some cases it has gone too far. ”
And the President is determined to try to explain this to people and to clarify it, and he is already doing a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been an abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this trial.
Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA sought good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up. ”
In the world, there is a radical extremism that is firmly committed to killing and blowing people up and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from blowing up and people from being executed because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
On Thursday, the President of the Senate's Subcommittee on European Affairs said that American legislators are preparing for Europe to respond to concerns from abroad regarding alleged US espionage and to convince Europeans that it is necessary to continue joining forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about their threats of stopping participation in anti-terrorism organizations because they were disillusioned by the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the US' national security interests, it is indeed important that Europe stays with us on a single ship, in view of joint efforts to combat terrorism, he said in an interview with Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the Chairman of the Senate of Foreign Relations for European Affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue our cooperation in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over the NSA programs.
The news in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some American allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstandings of metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States,
Another revelation quoted documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA was following the German Chancellor Merkel's mobile phone and up to 34 other world leaders.
Head of National Intelligence James Clapper has advocated the espionage of allies as necessary and has said that this is a common matter on both sides.
In the middle of the heat, Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary journey that should take place this year, hoping that members of both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the next few days, the names of other legislators intending to be published.
He said there's still work on the program.
Although Murphy said that the goal of the trip was to help correct relationships, he added that "well-meaning educational measures" would be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people in terms of spy programmes they have used for years.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programmes to better protect European rights, they must also realize that we are not the only ones carrying out spying here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is heading this weekend to the Middle East and to Poland to respond to the hostility that the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US tracking activity, has triggered.
Australian woman appealed against her stay in a Thai prison
A 21 - year - old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 - day prison on Phuket Island, falsely claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused on June 15 by the Earth Court on Phuket Island of perjury when the Thai police said that a taxi driver along with two other men who were supposed to have held her was attacked on Sunday, June 10.
However, the record on industrial television later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before confessing that she had invented the incident.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security detention facility on a periphery in Phuket instead of being put in jail for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who, in the case of his daughter, requested the help of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely worried" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It is obviously a difficult time, but we hope that he will return safely to us as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford appealed and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports from Australia, she has been on vacation in the Krabi recreational area in southern Thailand.
The legal resources in Thailand claim that Bamford was representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but she received a warning that appeal could lead to a lawsuit that would increase her sentence and result in her being put in adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to correct a broken picture for tourists, which may have just been behind a liberating verdict.
- A goal from a brother?
In the defense zone, he got a puck and no one else caught him.
Plus, the leak turned into a quick forhend loop.
Jaromír Jagr scored this way against Tampa at night on Wednesday, on Thursday night then 119. the winning goal in the NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svobod, the director of the Czech Railways, asked him if I was interested in doing an ad on their most modern Pendolino train!" he wrote at the introductory with the Jagr exaggeration.
I hear we're a lot alike.
I guess I'm gonna have to quit night training so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid the Minister of Defense might then come forward and want to do an ad on the jet!" added the smiles.
In addition, New Jersey scored a second victory in a row.
"And above all, you have noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottr is working," Jagr concluded.
Place of the post-election candlestick
The October elections rather than the winners brought a bunch of losers.
These are not only the parties that did not even reach the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. the SPOS), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD due to their internal dissolution.
Instead of the holiday candles, the politicians served us on the weekend after the election stew.
Andrei Babiš's movement became the jumper of the elections, which promised the voters to change the political style of government so far.
The fragmentation of the electoral outcome and the dissolution in the winning party is recorded by the political (for the sake of President Milos Zeman), regardless of the wishes of the voters who publicly supported the party which President Zeman has not elected to the Chamber of Deputies.
Although the President lost his strategic lead to other politicians due to an unpleasant event, he still has a few ways to recover it - for example by choosing a future Prime Minister.
While the ČSSD's chances of winning the Prime Minister's chair in my eyes are getting far away, entrepreneurs are approaching Andreju Babiš.
The post-election development is a mile away from creating a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government of ČSSD supported by the communists, this development is a better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.
Due to the volume resistance YES to join with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the coalition ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL (total 111 Members).
Due to the dissolution in the ČSSD, which thus became an illegible and weak partner in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be quite daunting for the ČSSD.
The Minority Government of the ČSSD, composed of "non-Zemans" on the Castle, probably won't pass.
In addition, any government to which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by the dissatisfactioned ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead to further dissolution in the party sooner or later.
So I ask myself, "Are we not going to make another early election by ourselves?"
The next election would be a referendum on the power of the ANO electoral mandate.
The plans for the introduction of sector taxes, a more significant increase in income taxes or the construction of a state bank, hopefully fell below the table.
On the contrary, the Parties to ČSSD, YES, KDU-ČSL and Dawn agree to promote entrepreneurship, a moderate fiscal policy (a government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote the employment of disadvantaged persons, to reduce the VAT rate for the goods selected.
The most common areas are social policy and the size of the state.
Yes, but it is now on top, so the program so far the most likely coalition YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would lean to the right.
Which, in my view, is a better result than a left-wing tax program for everything that is still moving in the economy.
