On an emergency call, the professor confessed that he shot his girlfriend
During a call to the emergency line with a shaky voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come home.
Lamb decided that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset, and that contacts with the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," said Lamb's letter.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the campus, where the police believe he shot the favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Chief of Police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university employees heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fate call on the emergency line shortly after.
In the end, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school, the students and the faculty were forced to hide behind locked doors, and the authorized authorities are still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details published by investigators on the side of the state, as well as students and employees who knew him, together created a picture of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed they were looking forward to his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote to thank the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other members of the faculty and many students attended courses at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations in terms of problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him that he was struggling with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had already asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons, stating that he had a problem.
And this year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes to the recruitment of university staff meant that a doctorate at which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
The president of the University, William LaForge, said that he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba seemed to have suffered something."
Lamb won't answer these questions anymore.
After he left campus, the police caught his trail crossing the Arkansas state border back to Mississippi.
Before he could have been arrested, Lamb killed himself with one gun shot at the yard house about a mile from his parents in Greenville suburbs in Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of Washington State, Methel Johnson.
He left the car running on the street.
It was not clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said she probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this county.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and education hours.
In spring he received a doctorate in education.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb's 20 when they met with friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older guy who tutored her playing guitar for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker back then.
The heart of all the girls has risen as soon as he has appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposed to have dated for a while.
During an emergency call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house, adjacent to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter, which is now 19 years old.
"She was completely broken," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She was best friend with her mother.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail stepped up at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, the bartender and the occasional entertainment coordinator at The Jule Room, the sparringly lit bar near Gautier, said the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, the sweat that Lamb finished on guitar and accordion for an countless crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"He was just a happy couple," he said.
We used to poke and record each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the killed professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boy's student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, some 900 people, including faculty members, employees, students and members of the community, attended a reminder event with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also took part in the Christmas Eve, during which the university choir won "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
School started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is over.
This is a healing day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported to Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was adjusted to reflect the fact that the police are now claiming that Lamb made a call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called him Prentiss his wife, there is no proof that they were truly married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us claims not to hire as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturer of toys and products claims to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it is planning to hire around 40,000 employees for business and distribution centres around the country, which is a decline compared to the 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting candidates this month, and that the staff will be accrued during October until December.
While holidays in themselves are months away, the shopping season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to assist in shops and sales, to send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his 'date' with Princess Diana.
The "Back to the Future" premiere was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," said the trailer for the upcoming document, "Back in time."
The movie starts and I realize I'm within reach of something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in time," is a documentary on "Return to the Future," which presents talks with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The "Back to the Future" premiere was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the best travel document ever filmed for me."
Back in time will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
United Nations chief says there is no military solution in Syria
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief once again urged all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and promote inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution.
Ban said at the Wednesday press conference that he was planning to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the division in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "has made this situation unsolvable."
The Ban called on five permanent members to show solidarity and unity, as they demonstrated in reaching the Iranian nuclear agreement to deal with the crisis in Syria.
8 electoral numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The rest of them waved their hands like they failed a joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But whether some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they're not doing it (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people are beginning to seriously wonder what that means for the nominating chances of this real estate magnate.
Of course, it is only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win a Republican nomination.
The experts point out that at this time of 2011, Rick Perry's leadership had taken the lead to the rise of Herman Cain, and in the end neither of them had won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could run into general elections.
But outside groups like Super PAC Jeba Bush and the Economic Conservative Club for Growth realize Trump's will to endure and start unloading their dollars on the stand in order to overthrow it.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that a real estate magnate is not just a fleeting phase:
Trump's favor assessment turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's vote showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
By mid-July, it was already 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of ten Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion on him.
And these numbers stick to the initial stages.
Following the vote of Quinnipiac University last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they would be either "enjoyed" or "satisfy" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they'd be "indignant" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent said they would be "encouraged" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Another closest to the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "disgruntled" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush was a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticised for his insolence and insult, 52 percent of Republican voters are all in favour of the idea that the real estate magnate has the right temperament for the post of president, according to the Monday vote of ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held at the state senator's club of Iowa, which is the first one in the country where 52 percent of Republicans think he has a commander's personality, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think that they have no personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independents say that their temperament does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to this idea.
When they wear their science hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question who most likely wins the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC survey from last week.
That's a change from late July when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: The voters of the GOP did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
By this time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans have chosen Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against 28 percent for the possible nomination of Mitt Romney.
Yet, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone anyway.
Some scholars point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is dispersed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the research of Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct battle between Trump and most other Republican candidates Trump will almost always receive majority support.
He leads on Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubie by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over a trader with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical match one against one.
The vast majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've already made their point.
The new CBS/NYT Tuesday survey shows that only more than half of Trump's supporters claim that they will no longer change their minds.
Clearly, a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they keep an open back door to change between candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent to his outsider fellow neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 of the 10 Republicans allegedly agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in his campaign announcement, immigration has been still holding as the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's insolence will draw key Hispanic voters from the Republican party and the damage will seek rebranding.
But according to a new Monday public opinion poll, ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the theme of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Government frustration is reaching new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half the support from Republican voters, especially given their condition outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post Monday vote say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The vote Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa revealed a few weeks ago that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were "disgruntled" and 21 percent "hell angry."
The House supported a greater share of the State's coal levies.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported a government amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the level of yields of the mining charges of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that this would give them extra money both the Treasury and the budgets of the municipalities.
The draft was criticised by members of the opposition who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they have been, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.At first reading, the House supported the government amendment to the Mining Act, which, among other things, means that the State should receive a greater share of the yields from mining companies.
The state's share will increase to 67%, while the municipality's share will decrease from 75% to 33% so far.
The formula also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for minerals that companies will extract.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million to the Treasury more than in 2013.
According to the government, the municipality's budget revenue is intended to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year the municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million and the state budget CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal was about CZK 200 million to the municipalities and the state CZK 66 million.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the remuneration from the accommodation spaces with the permitted mining to CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments should continue to belong to the municipalities in full.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the Members that the municipalities would gain 14 million to 100 million crowns a year instead of 14 million crowns.
The amount of mining charges will no longer be determined by the law, but it is determined by the government by its regulation.
The remuneration shall be calculated as the product of the quantity of mineral extracted and the rates for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
Mr Marek Benda, however, warned against the fact that setting the fee by the government does not have to comply with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging for a mineral that is a state property.
Only the municipalities whose territory is affected by the extraction shall receive the fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the city's money and a quarter of the state will be received.
The same ratio will be for the mining of radioactive rock.
The part of the money that the state will charge on the mining charges will be linked to purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to compensation for damage after mining or to provide the Bana rescue service.
The draft was criticised by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that they would damage the villages affected by both mining and the region.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that the mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget for the Minister of Finance," said David Kadner (Swilight) elected in the Ústecký Region.
Hana Aulická warned about the rise in unemployment in Mosteck.
The Kadner and the Australians unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, and Kučera wanted the law returned to the government to work.
The reasoning report states that, according to the mining companies, the increase in charges will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 % long-term contract.
Therefore, major consumers, such as power plants or heating plants, should not feel price increases.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for their efforts to reduce their operating costs, which would in particular mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to the Commission, the increase in employment charges is bearable.
According to the rapporteur on Milan Urban's amendment (ČSSD), it is crucial for Members to know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining before the adoption of the Act.
If coal is also mined by the limits, then it will have an impact on both the state and the municipalities' incomes, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Young that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should not fall until 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the ČSA should be broken for social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
The cheerful will lead the Czechs as one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players show up at the Davis Cup's Thursday draw on the board in India, and this time each of them is likely to hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to spread the load to the whole quartet due to the difficult conditions.
There is hot and high humidity in Delhi, which is why demanding matches are expected that can stretch up to five hundred.
We need to keep this in mind.
I'd like to spread it by the weather.
And according to what it will look like, Navrátil said during today's Czech selection training in the center of Raja Kumár Khanna.
The team leader and the world's forty Jiří Vesely count on both Friday and Sunday two games.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are probably protagonized to the position of two.
I want almost everyone involved.
It's in my head slowly, but I'm not going to say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be Štěpánek's participation in the Saturday four games.
It's just a question of who's gonna stand next to an experienced deblist who's got a 18:4 in Davis's four-game cup.
It's probably not funny.
There are options with Rosol or Adam Pavlásk.
"I really don't know who and what it'll look like," he said.
It's decided on the basis of the development of two games.
The variant may be Pavlásek, with Joyy surprised in the first round of winning the double over Australians.
"He's decent to the double," Navrátil said.
I've done it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to do the same performance I've shown since the second set.
"I am happy for the experience and I would like to bring a point," said Pavlásek.
The household will put Yuki Bhambri's (125th ATP ranking) in two games, which won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he defeated the third and fourth hundred rankings.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both challengers, and ours have experience from the ATP Tour, but we've seen a lot of times that the rankings in the Davis Cup don't decide.
"Determining the current form, the weather," said Navrátil.
Friday's introductory two games will start at 6:30 A.M. and can be reached due to weather.
It's supposed to rain and the court isn't under the roof.
However, it can be played for artificial lighting.
They've already lit it up, and it's got, like, 2,000 lux, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," said Navrátil.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ is very eagerly expected
Jeremy Corbyn's new manager will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time, he'll be working with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement, he asked for "less theatre and more facts."
He also said that he could skip several sessions he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of the leadership of Mr Corby, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual Congress of the TUC.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labourist leader to stand silent while singing the national anthem on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative MPs and is the centre of the attention of several stories on the front page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corby's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention.
Mr. Corbyn's spokesman said that he would "stand in respectful silence" and that he would acknowledge "the heroship of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend a national anthem to the Labourist leader to sing "no matter" despite his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on the top of Mr Corbyn's team, quoted differences in economics, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties initially supported him as a leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brant says that the political differences in work are also "classified" after the appointment of Mr Corbyn through his position in the European Union and the government's limit on benefits.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had tabled amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a benefit limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, stated that the party was "very clear" in opposition to government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party faced by David Cameron over the last decade since his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Workers' Party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas from the crowd for Mr Cameron's questions and received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims to be too confrontational and that they will refrain from both "proximity and toothed trade" and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow business secret, will represent him at PMQ if he does not attend — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea that he would let other colleagues speak for him from time to time because he heard that he had still discussed the matter with the spokesperson of the House of John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the style of "Punch and Judy," which was often associated with PMQ, but several years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer for the judgment of leaders, their management of the House and their position among other MPs, although critics argued that they had become a cartoon and that far-reaching reform is needed.
"Photos in Job": Young Homeless Trained as Photographers
Johannesburg Center is a tough place to be homeless.
But a group of former street kids found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was taken in Jobburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound is rising, while wage growth in the UK is speeding up
The pound jumped in the following dates and showed a recovery of the British wage growth, while FTSE 100 was led above using the SABMiller tender goal.
Between May and June, GB's profits, including bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009, and it seemed as if the estimates were coming closer to when the rates were going to rise.
Sterling rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505, and was 0.84% above the euro at €1.3730.
FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market share and jumped 20% after getting the bid closer to his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine the two biggest brewerys in the world, and the proximity of brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the Rival luxury product group Richemont.
The latest sales results of Richemont are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have begun to rise again.
Stocks in Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said they increased by $2.5bn through shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Stocks in the Mondi package and paper group were the biggest drop in the index and fell by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs reduced his credit rating to "sales."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company announced an 83% jump in profits in the middle of the year before tax £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansion
Executive Chairman of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that higher minimum wage for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs of his company, he states.
The costs could impact the plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
The opposers of the Prague apartment of the marshmallow are exulting.
Controversial construction got a stop sign.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investmenti considers the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
One hundred people protested against the building, which was to be built in close proximity to the Anežské monastery in the centre of Prague, and petitions were created in front of the Prague office.
The Magistrate stated in the decision that the construction law had been infringed because all the elements of the territorial decision had not been respected.
"The subject-matter of the territorial decision does not include, for example, the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, a sufficiently clear and clear description of the shape of the building, the definition of the territory concerned by the influence of the construction," he writes.
It also considers that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the original dossier, which had changed, as an illegal magistrate.
It is, for example, an opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be created on the premises of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the file that, however, the owner of the land only confirmed the approval of the project documentation for territorial management, not the approval of the location of the building on his land, writes the department of the construction order.
According to Francesco Augusta Razett, the Department of Construction of the Investor Company, has not taken note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for the initiation of the review has expired.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, complying with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in the press release.
The project, which is called the marshmeloun due to the alleged color of the facade, causes strong emotions in Prague.
In the city center, hundreds of people have gathered in the past to protest against the construction.
The association and the inhabitants of nearby homes are concerned that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticise the inadequacy of the building for the historical center of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Anežské monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Frank, the project has changed several times.
The original version of the 2008 project, which counted with the glass facade, rejected the Ministry of Culture, on the basis of the opinion of the National Monument Institute (NPO) and cancelled the authorisation of Prague monuments in 2010.
The new project of Praga Progetti e Investmenti with windows in the shape of faces but the NPU and the main monuments were approved and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the design rejects the complaints of opponents, said he never counted with the facade in pink colour, which gave the project a nickname after pink and white confectionery.
The Czech politician has taken the migrants.
Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees to the car, who said they wanted to serve about a half a mile.
According to him, it was not yet a crime in Hungary, he claimed to the People's newspapers.
We knew the lawkeepers didn't follow such a course.
But when the police stopped us, they arrested us to our surprise and transferred us to a custody facility in Szeged, described a letter.
In the cell, he eventually spent nine hours.
The police said they were doing the right thing, but they were communicating, because they didn't know English very well.
But he thought prison was a terrible thing.
For example, in our cell, about three times four metres [4 m], 15 refugees from Syria were in distress.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people have been locked in there for the next day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what to do with them, said Berg.
What can't be confiscated?
Ask the president of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday 18.9. Pavel Fučíková, President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic, will answer questions from readers at 9:30 p.m.
You can ask her about changes to the Enforcement Act applicable from 1 September 2015 and other matters related to executions or executions.
Metcash is launching a campaign in the countryside to fight Aldi's invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi’s influx in southern and western Australia.
Metcash is launching a campaign in the countryside to fight Aldi's invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of over 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands using mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are added brands such as Dunsborough based ice creamer Simmo's offering tastings in IGA stores and shop owners sell discounted tickets to the Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and hardware seller celebrates his annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake because southern and western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA’s commercial steps and generates a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Customers in South and West Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern States.
Anyway, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will count on 5 percent of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of the opening of the first shops that took over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week, in his report, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail could lose USD 360 million on annual sales and Metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West during the following year, and will generate sales of USD 500 and 600 million in individual markets.
Loss of food sales and volumes in the fixed price base of Metcash could cost him around 13 million USD on pre-tax revenues, confirmed by Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern States, mainly towards Aldi and Coles, although the last survey by Roy Morgan found that the buyers in IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that the sales of Metcash food will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decrease from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Hamish Douglas Fund, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "highly disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglas' comment.
But it is known that a member of the board of Metcash contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and the profit from the Metcash food trade , which supplies around 1200 IGA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesale went into counter-attacks and invested more than $150 million a year to settle counter prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week to help IGA retailers refurbish their stores by adding fast-growing food and news from private customers.
The Executive Director of Metcash, Ian Morrice, claims that the price leveling and refurbishment programs will catch up and hope that the big sale will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves glory for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a secondary loss in recent fuss with his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behaviour rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention thanks to the affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifier game in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had twice separated the referee, Harrison then declared: "Wawrinka had one stretch to Kyrgios and I had to stretch him too."
While the last time he was seen breaking a rocket, after a convulsed by Richard Gasquet's potential defeat at the US Open, Kokkinakis did unwaveringly defend Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for a second two-game location behind Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensely that I think Thanasi was a bit involved in the whole dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost because of a convulsion in the U.S., but he's not the first player to take his own frustration out of his own rocket.
But he was really doing very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a lot of respect.
He's got a fantastic team around him, and he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is a very adult 19-year-old man, working very hard and fits into the team great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, in the dressing room is very respected, training hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I simply think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios due to an important match that starts on Friday, and states that "the mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports the compatriot from Canberry to return to the team as a long-term stasis.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the game and not on all the controversy that has arisen around it [Cyrgeos]," Healy says.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the public's eyes he's growing fast, he's also made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time outside the sun, when he'll be able to think about it, is in my opinion the best solution for the team and also for himself.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and traps migrants
Following the notification of Hungary's threat on Tuesday, it closed its southern border with Serbia and detained those who attempted to cross it illegally in order to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants were accumulating in the country of no one, and Serbian authorities were reacting indignantly.
Those who have been stuck on the strips of the country between two states are those who run from violence in their home countries, build tents and settle down.
But feelings of frustration are coming.
When helicopters fly over them, migrants call together "Open the border!" and broadcast order units to Hungarian police.
Some refuse food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister states that it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be a part of the solution, not just an indirect injury.
During the following days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The riots at the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-state block did not come with a uniform immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece, and hoped to reach a possible agreement for the next month or the end of the year that the EU nations would adopt more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special EU summit next week on Tuesday to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary did not, however, attach its hopes to Brussels or its neighbours.
The Tuesday state of danger in two southern regions gave authorities greater power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up judicial cases of asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped pull barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point to the European Union for Refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who follow a better life than war refugees who seek protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalise the breach of the 4 metre fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia and also set longer time limits in prison for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government is declaring a state of threat," said the spokesperson of the Government of Zoltan Kovacs in the southern town of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, Parliament must continue to approve the deployment of the army that was expected next week, but reporters Associated Press at the border have been watching heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, an Orban's domestic defense advisor, said that the authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 caught already in the territory of the state.
They have penetrated the fence damage and are now under police custody accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered with barbed wire.
The main border crossing at Roszke was chaos because the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing and created pressures of people.
About 20 of them fit in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
2016: Hillary Clinton's jumper in front of Bernie Sanders fell by half in a national vote
Former Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of the democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (increasing from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to become president, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters argue that it is too soon to say that there are clear decisions that the candidate will support.
But the Clinton sponsors are more confident about their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost ground under her feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders has won several.
Clinton's keeping a big lead between women and easing them, but her leadership is narrowing down.
Its support among men decreased significantly and Sanders is losing only 5 points to her.
The advantage of the Clintons with democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared and now they're equal to Sanders.
Clinton, however, still has great leadership thanks to the senior voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit lead in front of Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points on her in this group.
About half the democratic primary voters across the country say she'd be enthusiastic about supporting Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and a further 15 percent would only support her for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
I don't think it's surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly inflamed about her.
The views are mixed among those that currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of democratic primary voters say they would be enthusiastic about support for Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked openly why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the time it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, a great choice and consensus on problems is quoted.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential candidate, 57 percent of the democratic primary voters would like him to face it - a third of them think he shouldn't run.
When the primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the nomination of the party, the most common choice is Biden.
Among the supporters of Clinton, she put more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's leadership will extend from 20 points when Biden is running to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; but this number fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him most likely to be elected is increasing.
However, when it comes to the issue of the importance of a candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over greater chances of election.
Like last month, not one democratic candidate or potential candidate acts as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their parties.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and they think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have that opinion.
The primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
As far as all these standards are concerned, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as a state secret continue, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter and say that their overall view of her has not affected at all.
But between the American public, it's a whole different story.
Half the Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third of them are satisfied.
The public's views on this topic were already shared in March, shortly after the problem came out.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail controversy has no influence on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent of their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
These are mainly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived to be honest and credible among the voters of her party, this question is still a problem between registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and credible, which is a drop of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump both have good grades for leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were best placed in honor.
Sanders sees more people as honest than respectful, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't get an opinion on him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up behind Donald Trump in the national election.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and others are letting them seek support.
The Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump's overwhelming majority, and they climbed from 23% of the support in the last CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% at the same time.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups and excluding Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorin and the governor of Ohio, John Kasich, is completely behind by the Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker on a 10% stake-out.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio, Florida, are all in third place with 6%.
The error rate for the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson has improved and achieved 19% support among Republicans for Trump's 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
At Carson's rising trend, Trump decided to shoot a blind neurosurgeon in retirement, and Carson even apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five fraternity members accused of the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the overloading brother ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, a murder charge against five people was filed.
Members of the Brotherhood of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital late, which contributed to his death, the police announced.
The police said he had a tied eye, a bag full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the goal through the frozen fields.
Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches and then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Dogs Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng passed out, and they allegedly waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, claims the police.
However, they found time to change Deng's dress, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the state president of the Brotherhood, and ask him for advice, said police chief Chris Vagner at the press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and basically preferred the well-being of the brotherhood over Michael Deng's life," Wagner said.
He failed to recover and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck with blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"To far too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity abuse and at least one student dies every year because of overloading since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengov's family, in a statement.
The Brotherhood and their members must be accountable and this step is important for the authorities.
The grand jury, Monroe County, recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with assault by overcrowding and criminal association.
"We want to detain not only the persons involved, but, if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will also take them to responsibility," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned brotherhood and national brotherhood has abolished its relationship with local branches.
These are tents when the Fed raises interest rates
Rate growth will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slip into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy, specifically, it offers the history of a small timer.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in rising rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when tariff increases begin, but rather on how long the normalization will take.
There are really more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss due to the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as the end of the 'cheap' era," said Julian Jessop, the leading global economist of Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect that the gradual return of American interest rates to more common, but increasingly low, will create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is an overview of how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded in the last few months, the expected increase in rates may make the air a bit unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a trend for the re-stopping of shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again possibly reflects a delay in monetary policy," analysts Deutsche Bank stated in a recent study on what will happen after the increase in the Fed.
More precisely, the market over the last 35 years is often the most - about 14 percent - heading towards a relatively flat rate in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent), and then again returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return on the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's main stock strategy published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on shares tends to become more significant later in the rate increase cycle and the return is beginning to decrease.
The recession is a real economic life, but rising rates often help her.
At present, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and could hasten the recession.
The most remarkable thing is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history when increasing Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, only twice the nominal annual GDP increase was below 4.5 percent during the 118th increase since 1950.
Despite the fact that in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few would expect it to be maintained when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, states Atlanta Fed.
Increasing tariffs in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise, "this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready to grow the Fed all year round and all eyes turned to a meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, future trade is only 25% likely.
"In our study since 1950, all increase cycles have been in a super-cycle lever effect increase with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," says the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of the Fed's waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now at 74 months and we are continuing.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market expects an increase in rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the shares experience.
The main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than for shares when the Fed changes its policy direction.
In the case of bonds, the yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/reduction cycle.
At the end of the bond increase cycle, the yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwaba's strategies believe that the increase in rates will bring the yields closer between long-to-short-data bonds equal the curve.
High-income debt often works better in this climate, although "we are still careful about tensioning the income," said Kathy Jones, a fixed-age analyst at Schwab in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectations of the Fed's policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of a more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are on top, the yield curve is more flat, the loan margin has expanded and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
In general, companies that carry out most of their business in the US will win after the interest rate rises and local products will become more attractive.
Transnational companies with a lot of debt will be worse off, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space, and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of shares tends to overcome within three months of the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachsve analysts in a report for clients.
Companies with strong balances overtake the weak balance sheet companies in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as low volatility stocks, also overcame their counterparts of lower quality on average by 4 (percentage points), and 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside of purely stock games, consumers also benefit from a growing dollar.
Savings can also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, claims MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "helling"
He believes he's becoming increasingly indistinguishable than his commercial opponent.
He's also focused on BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British.
A fellow Member of Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says he's not an original idea either.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" into Classic FM, claims a leading MP and accumulates fresh pressure on broadcasting to prove that they're doing something that commercial broadcasts don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's bosses that the public service radio station seems to be "stupid" and increasingly indistinguishable than its business opponent.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "stupid"- but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that I'm thinking, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," said Mr Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC has rejected the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business opponent in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I would not learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to living with music and making music is actually at a top level.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, the BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element in the production of the BBC that got under fire for trampling on the heels of commercial competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the commission.
Conservative Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that the BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as Judges are shining - was produced by "a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" next time it started a fun series.
However, he refused to exclude ordering more future series of The Voice or spending money on license fees on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales have been growing at the slowest rate since August, and the guilt may be Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth has been recorded since the 2000 recordings themselves began.
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be a reason to stop spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise and has made many British major streets the city of ghosts.
However, experts argue that there are signs of setting online sales, and new data show a 7 % increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure on August represented the lowest increase in growth since the very beginning of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts argue that there are signs of online sales setting, and new data show a 7 % increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth over the past years and go back to 2000, the situation has always been rationalized over time," says the IMRG Sales Index Editor for Guardian Andy Mulcahy.
It explains that online sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant and therefore seems to sound.
The Black Friday phenomenon that was taken over from America is quoted as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from buying before this event, which takes place last Friday November.
In the last year, five times more than the average of the shoppers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and toss several websites of sellers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, through which the buyers renegotiate, can keep customers from buying again
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was spent online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of sales are carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
The Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the crane in Mecca and the Bin Laden family was punished
The bodies of the 29 dead were transferred through the streets of the Muslims during the execution of the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of the construction magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health stated that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane crash in Grand Mosque, Mecca.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, mourners chose the way and gave up the respect of the victims when the first of the fallen got on their last path to the cemetery in Al-Moaisse.
The sad news passed past the sacred place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell upon the believers.
The bodies were released for the funeral, and the Saudi king punished the building group of the bin Laden family over a disaster that also left 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of the crane in Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual snake pilgrimage began.
Saudi officials have already promised that the serpent will take place in Mecca and thousands of people will continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group shouldn't have left the shoulder of the crane up there when it wasn't in operation.
The Arab version of the Decree, bearing the State operated by the Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the fall.
The English Disk Agency did not report this detail, but stated that the head of the company was prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane’s fall to the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are reversing before the Haj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any declaration on the collapse of the crane and its representatives for comment were not made available.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Tens of cranes are surrounded by Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling families for decades and has been running large construction projects.
The late leader of the Al Qaeda Osama bin Laden was the son of a renegade, who the family forgave in the 1990s.
The crash became in the midst of a strong wind and rain just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that each capable Muslim must attend at least once in his life.
Officials say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be devoted to the relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half of this amount.
Chief B&Q claims that East European traders working cheaply are already trending
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen, claims Veronica Laura
The number of East European traders taught is behind the point of growth
The result is open 200 Srewfix stores aimed at traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Worked by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for Daily Mail
They say the British put away hammers and brushes and hand them over to trained East European craftsmen to work at their home.
If you're doing it with a hammer or a paint brush, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to work at their home, according to the head of the company for Srewfix B&Q.
Veronica Laura, the new Executive Director of Kingfisher, who owns a chain for domestic needs, claims that the large increase in the number of East European traders offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
The result is that Kingfisher plans to open 200 other Srewfix stores aimed at traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laura says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores, because eight out of ten shopping decisions make better half.
Currently, most male workers are.
She said that there is a need to address the increasing demographic trends that depict more women's households that make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Laura says, "We still have men working in our stores.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the purchase decisions.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laura, who is one of just five women at the head of FTSE100's leading companies, has also transformed her top team to reflect equality between male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost alone in the fact that he has half the representation of women among employees, including executive and financial director.
Laura says, "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't hard to find good women to take to our place.
Kingfisher announced a decline in profit in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the cost of closing business.
As a result of the Kingfisher trend owned by Srewfix and B&Q, it is to open 200 new shops
The December allowance of 600 crowns to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It is justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said the Vice-President of TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of merit.
The President of the ODS Zbyněk Stanjura noted that although a one-off contribution was good, it would have been better in the long term to be standardized because it would have been reflected in the years ahead.
"We have the space to find the mechanism that we will arrange," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which the next year was to be approved beyond the scope of the law.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which is not pink according to her.
The higher valorisation next year would mean the budgetary impact of CZK 5.5 billion and the ministers are discussing every stamilion.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that the pace of valorization had been reduced in the past.
The rapporteur, Mr Opálka, pointed out that the proposal did not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
In December, the right hand of the paycheck significantly complicates and may even make it difficult, he said.
The president of the ČSSD, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed shortening the time limit for the committee to discuss the standard for ten or 20 days, even the right-hand side blocked it.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost the state a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money is to go from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions should grow on average by about a hundred crowns.
The contribution should be given according to the pension amendment by people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could be obtained by those who lost their pension in December before they were paid.
However, they would have to apply in writing for the surcharge by the end of next year at the latest.
Revenues in the Czech Republic are regularly validated for January, namely price increases and a third increase in real wages.
This year, the pension is 41.5 percent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5%.
Last year the state spent CZK 314,7 billion on old-age pensions according to the state's final account, which was about five billion more year-on-year.
The expenditure on old-age pensions represented 26% of all expenditure on the budget and 46% of all expenditure on the statutory basis.
The average full retirement last year increased by 104 to 10.714 crowns in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17.000 proportional pensions.
Jake's left plans for his political career, he'll be devoted to science.
According to the Russian media, the senate chair was almost certain.
In the Council of the Federation, he was to represent the western Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as the candidate of the government party of the Single Russia, defended his post in the Sunday elections with an overview.
According to Russian law, the senators are not elected by the citizens, but they are selected by the governor from three candidates whose names they will notify before the governor elections.
After the elections, the senator will choose from three candidates.
The complication for Jake was the fact that he hadn't lived in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years, as required by the law.
Although the Kremlin has found an exception for Jaken, he is an extraordinary and authorised ambassador who is not covered by the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger is over.
The last drop in the main hero's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who ran out of strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janžurová decided on her grandfather's life, her old age and her funeral.
It is clear to John that she is on a similar path with her wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová.
He remembers once having his own will and dreams, wanting to live with dignity and freedom.
He wants to regain his government over his life - and as a solution, he chooses to escape from it so far, he said to the story of Slavik.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners did not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role will be played by Bartošek, with whom he had already worked on the Invisible Show.
Yet, the actor who appeared in front of the camera after a longer break in recovery after a serious illness surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I gave him a script, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's probably a gibberish athlete.
He used to ask himself where he'd sit before he shot the next scene.
This time he was riding a bike, climbing rocks and even going uphill.
And all of that in the record tropical heat, the director said.
According to Bartoshka, women are taking tigers to make him a rabbit in time.
They'll feed him a little bit, but they'll shut the door so he doesn't think of playing tiger outside the rabbit.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie, the actor commented on it.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
It's also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic, and it means well.
But at the same time, she's a usurper, and she wants to look after her husband to death, said Bajgar.
The film depicts the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinky and Alice - Tanya Vilhelmová and Pavel Beretová - and the sons-in-laws Erika and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and TV Slovakia.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google's American Internet Company has promised to provide up to $5,5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees flow to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday, Google.org, which is the charity branch of this Internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled some of Telič's visit for criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the NO movement Pavel Telička postponed the Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijan authorities cancelled the official part of the visit today.
According to Telička, this is justified by the EP resolution last week which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telička co-authored.
By deciding the Azerbaijani Party, Telička lost the opportunity to talk with the official partners and also about visiting political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, he explained in the press statement his Brussels office.
The journey, which was planned several months in advance, Telička wanted to use the text sent by the CTC to meet with Parliament and executive representatives and representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners.
The EP resolution condemns "unseen repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent verdict on Azerbaijan’s opposition journalist Chadija Ismail, who was committed to uncovering corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out that it will build its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out the Russian air base in Syria in future.
We don't have such plans yet.
But nothing is ruled out, he said.
Russia has an old naval base in Syria in the port of Tartus, which has so far been used as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian press reports, Russian weapons and military material have risen to Syria since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, they are military shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians are planning to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which for the time being remains the bastion of Syrian President Bashar Assad.
But Washington is not quite clear about Russia's particular military intentions in Syria, and American commentators agree.
US Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke to Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria, which was their third phone call in the last ten days.
Next week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go to Moscow to interpret the concern about gathering Russian arsenal near Israel.
The White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, called Assad's support for Moscow a lost bet.
On the objectives of Russia's policy in Syria, he stated that they were rather unclear.
According to him, Moscow has made Syria its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, it is not quite clear.
According to Russian press speculation, the war in Syria is to be the main topic of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader is not allowed to speak about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas.
According to today's report to The New York Times, the U.S. government does not exclude President Barack Obama from meeting the Russian president during the UN meeting.
However, the views among the White House advisers are said to be falling apart.
Today, the TASS Agency, recalling the words of the Kremel spokesperson, Dmitri Peskov, wrote that Putin has not yet met Obama on the program of her New York stay.
Put sesame oil on a gallbladder diet, hemp helping to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
All the healthy substances remain in the oil when cold seeds are pressed.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladders.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for preventing cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics, the Czech Republic has been the most frequent cause of death for several years.
Galactic inflammation is mainly a concern for women, helping sesame oil.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in the pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used on gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids that contain are a good prevention of the formation of bile stones.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer three times more often than men.
In general, problems with gallbladder concern people who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can be used successfully on a liver diet that is very similar to gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that bring about the consumption of this oil, they should be careful of the products from the exotic food stores.
Producers from Asia often use overflowed seeds for pressing, which have a greater taste.
Oil will lose all active substances, as described by Ladislav Jejecký, Executive Director of Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsko, which produces bio virgin cold pressed oils.
The company also manufactures sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our press will be able to press eight kilos of sesame.
The raw material shall be heated to a maximum of 40 degrees by mechanical pressing and therefore the product meets the criteria for extra virgin marking.
There would be a loss of nutrients at higher temperatures.
Sunflower oil benefits from heart and vascular diseases.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
The research conducted by Jarmila Hamerská at Masaryk University showed that 43% of the respondents prefer him in the hot kitchen.
It is not really suitable for frying, however, as it starts to burn over at 180 °C.
It is better to use it to season salads, for example, and it is especially suitable in a diet in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which most of all fatty acids lower cholesterol levels.
In heart problems, you should be careful about the amount of total received fat and calories.
For example, there are 62 calories in one spoonful of sunflower oil, 99 calories in a spoonful of rapeseed oil.
As regards the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore appropriate to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts as long as the sesame and hemp nine months.
Storage in the refrigerator will be extended.
The old oil people will know, in particular, the bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no cataract on the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical cannabis are classified among the so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot make the body itself and must be taken from food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
Scientific studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams of it, while the Icelandic take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a support diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about using hemp oil, they don't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that it is among the best-selling in Bohemia Oil.
It'll be sold 500 liters a year.
People often use one spoon fasting in the morning.
Hemp oil is not tasteful, but it will enhance immunity perfectly, advised Daniel Vlček from the Kraslice firm Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, Americans are the most enthusiastic nation of barbecuers.
There's a 1.4 grill for one house there.
All over the world, there are all kinds of grilling competitions that only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs aren't behind.
On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people did not grill.
The vast majority then grills several times a year.
To make the grill successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat marinating several hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable for this while maintaining healthy ingredients while grilling?
In general, the grilling process itself should be saved with fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils are then lost to the body of beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain when consuming oils from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
It does not mean, however, that the extra virgin oils will not find their use during barbecue.
Grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When meat is said, experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsko immediately equip themselves with grape oil.
The taste of both meat and fish is wonderfully added.
The kitchen features a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Thus, even at such a high temperature, as one of the few oils retains the health of the beneficial substance, Daniel Vlček of Bohemia Oil describes the benefits of grape oil, which is one of the few Czech producers of this wine grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linolic acid and is therefore effective in the fight against excess cholesterol.
In grape oil our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise themselves for using grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for cold dishes, for example when seasoning salads, but also for heat treatment of dishes.
So there are two ways to use the barbecue, marinating and grilling itself.
We can preserve their juicyness by marinating meat and fish.
Three components must be present when preparing the marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
We supply acidity with apple vinegar, for example, so that we can soften the meat.
Spices again give the meat a taste, and oil preserves and supplies the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because, as one of the few oils, it can pass through dark meat.
So, the marinated meat or fish are ready to grill, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by only a few drops to prepare dishes.
The same applies to barbecues.
Some oils are completely taboo for this way of preparing.
This applies especially to flax, hemp and rape oil, which should not be heated at all.
Wipe the grill with oil from the grill itself, so you don't burn food.
The preparation of annexes is also an essential part of the barbecue.
The grilled meat and fish are suitable for virtually anything - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, a salad hot summer.
You need: • 1 pc of peach • 1 pc of rucola • 1 cup of pickled cucumber • 1 cup of salad leaves mixture • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl a broken sleeve, sliced cucumbers and sliced peach on large cubes.
According to the taste of salt and salt, you can also taste ground chili and soy sauce.
Finally, pour a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste you can soak the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it does not matter only the drugs but also the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, this is not just about medical care, such as women with multiple sclerosis, they also need consultations if they decide to have a child, social counselling, housing, etc. are part of the care of these patients.
Yet all of this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient himself.
The more he fights the disease actively, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change the way he lives.
As physicians point out, the passivity of the patients frees the room for the activity of the disease.
For example, regular movement has been shown to significantly delay the time when the patient needs some compensation, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to various myths, such as that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is why the page "Bezmytu.cz" has been created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Take your chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, the word doubles that the sooner the disease is treated, the more your doctor may influence something.
It's because we have multiple sclerosis medication at an inflammatory stage where the neurodegeneration process is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the more hope is that we will manage to stop and delay disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurology Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis of rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weakening of lower limbs or imbalances.
The patients are treated according to their individual needs: maintaining fitness, improving walking, strengthening the pelvic floor, reducing swallowing disorders or improving coordination.
"It is really individual, depending on the particular patient's difficulties," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, the primary of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine at the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it is a little different for everyone.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, motor activity also strengthens the immune status of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive feature of regular exercise is the fact that the sick are verifying what they can do, and that strengthens their confidence.
"The endorphins are also washed up during the exercise, and one feels good about it," warns PhDr. Kamila Szasová from the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinic of the Faculty Hospital of Royal Vinohrady.
By affecting the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
Directly so we interfere with the mental and immune processes and stabilize the disease, supplies.
"In the past, these patients were being spared, we now know that they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, the priority of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
The aim of physiotherapy is to keep a person as self-sufficiency as long as possible, including job placement.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergotherapists to give each individual a compensation device tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult situation.
When a serious illness comes to your life, most people shake it.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a painful soul, we should go to someone, not try to kidnap everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them in such a way that they can finally conclude that even with handicap, a full life can be lived and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinova - Schubertová from the Neurology Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the manufacturer Latecoere in Prague, the airbuses wouldn't fly.
Air production is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
New aircraft are filled with titanium or light and solid composite materials that someone can't make and process.
Yet, next to the super-accident, computer-controlled machine tools, there are autoclaves for the formation of composites that come across something as ordinary as apricot ovens.
In a drum, which reminds a pot of cotton candy, the edges of the metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are mended in a pile of ovens.
"No one has come up with anything better yet," smiles Ivan Dubský, Director-General of Air Door Manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the complex in Letňany, Prague, the former Lettov complete doors for Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world, they deliver doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which are built in Prague, also allow passengers to enter the first and higher class on the upper decks of the largest airbus aircraft in the world A380.
There are also doors full of compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto.
For example, the company lets the time-keys be arranged twice a year.
If there is no inspection record on the yellow sticker, they should explain to the auditors of Airbus or Boeing in the Prague plant, who drive regularly to see if the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
But human senses have not completely replaced advanced technology.
There are 1500 rivets on one door to A320.
You have to hand-knack the rivets.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the hitter, they will know if the rivet is already well cracked.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The rivet may rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimetres.
That's about double the thickness of the human hair.
During the checkup, the trained touch comes in.
When the controller goes over his finger in a row of rivets, he knows if there's any out of tolerance.
Then he takes the exact perverter into his hand.
Summer lived before 1989 the program of the training military aircraft L-39.
But in 1991, none of them were made.
The company had to quickly find new orders.
That's when she came together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won a tender for the emergency door supplier for model A321.
The courtship with Boeing wasn't that happy.
"We were then a small company that didn't have enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable deliveries," says Dubský.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained in love if Letov had not taken an interest in the Prague conference of the international association of the aviation industry of the French group Latecoere in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French started, says Dubský.
A year later Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
As early as 2000, the assembly of parts of the door for A320 started.
Three years later, the upper deck door came for A380.
In 2006 the company built a new hall for the processing of composites due to deliveries for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't be able to get to these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we could do parts or small parts.
Partners want a 20 or 30-year supply guarantee, explains Dubský.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of over CZK 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
The exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certification and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company would not have produced any aircraft doors.
Get certificates that the manufacturing processes correspond to customer requirements and in repeated checks keep them costing themselves according to Dubsky million crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They're more precise and stricter.
We have to train the staff, equip the equipment, and re-certify the entire process, says Dubský.
Now, the company is finishing the process of metaling zinc and nickel, which will replace harmful cadmium for human health.
The projects were received from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people of Boeing will come, check the whole line's concept.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
One set of samples will test themselves in their lab and then compare the results with ours, approximates the Dubian way the customers control them.
The rewards are long-term exclusive contracts for the Prague company.
With the Prague plant today stands and the production of embryos falls.
For A320 it produces half of the total volume of the door.
To replace the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complicated for Brazilian or European producers.
However, this does not mean that he could make a price out of the door.
The contract includes a price curve.
It says how much one door will cost by ten, fifty, a hundred made pieces.
The price per piece keeps falling to a certain limit value.
We need to fit into this price formula.
If we don't, we're going to lose, says Dubsky.
Half the hall, where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M are assembled, is empty so far.
But it is a symbol of the future.
A new semi-robot riveting and door assembly line for the innovative A320 Neo is being built behind the curtain.
The riveting speeds up and tightens.
"This is the trend of installation in aviation," says Dubský.
The outlet has a secure future line.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of the new A320 model.
Just a few meters away there is a line for the complete installation of the door for the upper deck of A380.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company has to pass the qualification tests for the installation of certain electrical and electronic devices in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also relies on further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company when it can process compositions in addition to metal materials," says Dubský proudly.
Latecoere, however, reaches the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no more place in Letov, where he's based.
Before the entrance of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now it has 800, and within three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing push over hundreds of new aircraft every year, they don't have to worry about the job.
Despite having contracts for several years ahead, the parent company of Prague Latecoere faced a threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay off the loans in September.
Eventually, Latecoere was able to communicate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, some of the loans were traded for shares.
The creditors gained a share of 37.4 percent in the company's capital increase by EUR 57.4 million.
The debt of the company fell by two thirds, i.e. by EUR 180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company signed new shares for EUR 222.9 million among the existing shareholders.
In total, it raised the capital by EUR 280 million.
At the same time, the group is benefiting from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
The average increase in procurement is expected by four percent per year until 2017.
In the custom book he has orders for EUR 2.6 billion, which corresponds to four years of production.
The French media say that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the drips.
The Czech plant in Letňany in Prague is important for groups.
16 percent contribute to the sales of the group.
According to the number of employees, he is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Members supported the increased share of the State's coal levy.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million to the Treasury more than in 2013.
According to the government, the municipality's budget revenue is intended to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year the municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million and the state budget CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal was about CZK 200 million to the municipalities and the state CZK 66 million.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the remuneration from the accommodation spaces with the permitted mining of CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments should continue to belong to the municipalities in full.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the Members that the municipalities would gain 14 million to 100 million crowns a year instead of 14 million crowns.
The amount of mining charges will no longer be determined by the law, but it is determined by the government by its regulation.
The remuneration shall be calculated as the product of the quantity of mineral extracted and the rates for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
Mr Marek Benda, however, warned against the fact that setting the fee by the government does not have to comply with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging for a mineral that is a state property.
Only the municipalities whose territory is affected by the extraction shall receive the fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the city's money and a quarter of the state will be received.
The same ratio will be for the mining of radioactive rock.
The part of the money that the state will charge on the mining charges will be linked to purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to compensation for damage after mining or to provide the Bana rescue service.
Today, the draft was criticised by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that they would damage the villages affected by both mining and the region.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that the mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget for the Minister of Finance," said David Kadner (Swilight) elected in the Ústecký Region.
Hana Aulická warned about the rise in unemployment in Mosteck.
The Kadner and the Australians unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, and Kučera wanted the law returned to the government to work.
The reasoning report states that, according to the mining companies, the increase in charges will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 % long-term contract.
Therefore, major consumers, such as power plants or heating plants, should not feel price increases.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for their efforts to reduce their operating costs, which would in particular mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to the Commission, the increase in employment charges is bearable.
According to the rapporteur on Milan Urban's amendment (ČSSD), it is crucial for Members to know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining before the adoption of the Act.
If coal is also mined by the limits, then it will have an impact on both the state and the municipalities' incomes, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Young that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should not fall until 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the ČSA should be broken for social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide interest rates for the American Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists contacted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historical event, because the flight has passed since the Feds reduced the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalising interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The American economy has done quite well, there has been a recovery in the form of the addition of trillions of dollars to the government account and the creation of only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be ready for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great opportunities against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00 SEC.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on that day and his colleague - wrote a note saying that he was "flying" the first murder and that he wished he could take it back, revealed the government authorities on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around 10:00 p.m.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send the police to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a "nice dog" in the house, which "will not bother anyone," but is upset.
The police requested the caller's name, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also didn't explain why there were shootings in the house.
When the police arrived at the scene, Amy Prentiss, a 41 - year - old body, found a handwritten message from Lamb, saying: “I am so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb went on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt's history teacher and then took his own life.
The university dean William LaForge said that he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "something was obviously happening in Mr Lamb's head".
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities stated that there was no "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person."
The divorce happened 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "shocked" on the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald said, worked Prentiss out of the house on the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," she said.
The police said that Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said that he would not go to jail.
When the cops caught him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
According to a CV published on the school website, Lamb obtained a doctorate in education at Delta University in spring 2015.
Stars That Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
In 2001, he fought leukaemia and lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All these things certainly charge their taxes.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out of the game for a double fracture for a few months.
Luke Shaw suffered a double right leg fracture during the defeat of Manchester United in the League of Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this wound in tears and eliminated it for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Hector Moren's reckless procedure in 15 minutes by Shaw's 20-year-old passing through PSV.
Nine minutes he was treated on the playground and he also needed an oxygen mask before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture, and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transported tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a guy who comes to Manchester at 18 years old, it's very hard, but he plays fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the closets, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will take six months of treatment and he won't be able to play in a group phase.
I believe he'll play this season again.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure with both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their messages, you can't say how ruined I am, my journey to recovery starts now and I'll come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw's injuries in a defeat against PSF
The English defender will have an added incentive to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Coc, coach of PSV, said, "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in the 2014 World Cup for Mexico against Van Gaal.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponents, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," said Coca.
I wasn't able to spot this moment.
I only saw a ball pointing in the other direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched him, but I didn't see the procedure on Luke.
In an interview for SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
You sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long to learn almost from memory.
You must not be David Cameron.
On a request from a child scheme provider to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister of Lorax, a 1971 story by Dr. Seusse, chose.
It was difficult to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the SuperCamps website and goes on: "A funny, touching, creative and with strong content, such I liked to read to my children because behind it was always a picture or a message I had never seen before."
All right, except that in the following paragraph Cameron reportedly described the story of the book according to an elevator from the 2012 film, which added other characters and details to fill in a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, the boy named Ted hopes to gain the heart of the girl's dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," is a brief book that records the object of love unknown Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it wasn't suspicious enough, the text that Cameron added reads as a summary elevator to the film Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of a girl's dreams, Audrey."
Since he was an openly practical parent, Cameron seems unlikely to be familiar with the history of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature destroys the countess, trees cutting off the industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titled Lorax, a shivering, moustache creature who "speaks for trees."
Most likely so relatively little important PR task got a helper who never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
Downing Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron's supporter's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of neglecting England, but he's still holding
Competeing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England has chosen for this tour, I think it would be unlikely to repeat the defeat 3-0 that she suffered last time in the test series.
I wouldn't rule out winning the guests either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting line and the collective thinking is strong; they will not carry the scars of 2012, only youthful positiveness.
With the ball is Moeen Ali's developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents an offensive possibility.
Related: Adam Lyth fell off the team of England in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lyth is a tough nut for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were against two good attacks in difficult conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that the cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no question marks around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and I mentioned earlier — players are their best choicers.
A few more half-century years, and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performances were not 100%, and I am not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time a batter gets to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only thing for you to talk about is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in the best shape — but this wasted opportunity is already the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and that's a hitter I'm judging very positively.
He's an x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he won 236 against us on the Trent Bridge field, which he kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course, all of this will depend on the overall United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting at Cook's side, who would get another extra spinner while he kept four quicks, was raised and I have no reservations against her.
I don't understand why a stokemaker can't fire, and this lefty man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
He immediately succeeded in doing so for three centuries and did not even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow him, I was intrigued by him as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a pramit, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectives have decided for their youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made a few changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
Appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, combatant from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial matches can be a master's move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings both energy and ruthless spark to the team.
I've always felt that he was directly born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten up and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's partner Ben Stokes got a one-day break, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that decision.
Even though many disagree, trainers and voters do not create a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts stagnating by 2017.
David Cameron's unimaginable renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into more problems with every last day and without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is It Yes or No?" Corbyn will lead the Workers' Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have had enough of British egocentric agendas, divisive concessions and disturbing changes to the treaty that they usually did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided they didn't want it even if they took out social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture before the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with words that they win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an uninvolved Britain in Europe - "Do not leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they do not care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a well-balanced German Chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with the long-standing Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on its right, Spain on its left.
It's hard to watch them break their legs with the help of Selfie Brits who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may plan deliberately useless SNP-style notes during the campaign prior to the 2017 referendum in the UK to succeed in the Brexit process, claims a friend.
"The renegotiation solved the problem" and "British has nothing of value from the negotiations."
Europeans know for their own injury how bad Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the EU is about the press oligarchs of the Barons, because they were not during a referendum inspired by Tony Benne in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They can duly remember the name Boris Johnson, a deviant Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels rapporteur, "EU straight banana" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his insolence, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of bad guys who don't pay taxes, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo-non-sea departments that owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a crazy gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her so she won't have you for dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routines since Blair accepted the principle of an EU Constitution that had been sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and obtained a firing card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back on Monday in Westminster friendlyly - I told him that he should not waste any more time on me - appears to be in danger of reinventing Murdoch Neil Kinnock's boycott strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left with the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe, I say it nicely, is evolving.
He claims he would like to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's frenzy and the wild shores of Tory's little Englander can certainly approach it.
That's what Hilary said, "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said on radio and television this week when his inner scout couldn't have decided to admit that Corby's appointment as the shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father fought on TV for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - apparently wasn't what McDonnell said or what JC told his fellow Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever background is any sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he touched me too - the discipline of the report remains important in the ages of all-day television and especially in faith, the party of paranoia and betrayal, which are social media
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign as obvious, as McDonnell stated.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corby's basic crackdown on EU membership - in line with their Bennité-occupied economy, the anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for which narcissism is a small difference of the central nature of dogmatic bickering.
As with his twisting about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end this - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of British concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is quite disappointed by the British "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when reducing the cost of conservative government in power, as I was reminded of the Monday launch of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticise an electronic review published by Public Health England
A government-funded statement that electronic cigarettes are 95 % safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are connected to the tobacco industry, say researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet's criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE Agency published a "restriction" report last month and described it as a "complex review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the extent of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The introductory officer at Lancet magazine last month attacked the "extraordinaryly lame base" on which the PHE based its main findings.
Two other experts who wrote for BMJ questioned a claim that was allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They say that the public could expect the PHE's claim, which is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people invited to prepare an analysis of the multi-criteria (MCDA) decision model to synthesize their views on damage associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell submits that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly previously received funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved the public health authorisation BAT in the sustainability report, states.
One of the 12 participants admitted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not funding previously received from Philip Morris International tobacco company.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but it contains several famous electronic cigarette champions, some of which also declare industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some other participants at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PHE was also attended by tobacco guides.
The report in this group "exceeds eloquently," missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Prosperity at PHE, stated that the claim at BMJ had been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers dies because of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what they do not display, especially when there was so much confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people will die from smoking and smoking-related diseases annually cost NHS £2 billion a year.
With clear emphasis on the current evidence - that even though e-cigarettes are not without risk, they only carry a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we have our national competence.
BBC should end up with EastEnders, says former Director of Channel 4.
Former Director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give their right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for having deployed public service programs that are likely to only follow a handful of people into complex broadcasting times compared to its rivals' greatest rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After General Director Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he was trying unsuccessfully to connect with the BBC for six years, which he worked on Channel 4.
"I fight with the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions," said Johnson in the communication committee in the Upper House, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you keep licence fees that I'm not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, you should reduce the production at least in terms of programmes that are not produced or commissioned by others.
They're broadcasting The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would have broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, senseless.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regression tax should support programmes that can be funded without contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and, of course, produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would give their right hand for them.
I cannot understand how these are public broadcasting services.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur in the field of series, led by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty about catching up on ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the most popular BBC show repeats those that former Sky Executive Director, Tony Ball, used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC will sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more pampered BBC public service programs "goes to the BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they fulfil their powers and they can argue when they are preparing for their hypocritical mission to justify £4bn income from license fees, "But of course we are doing all these obscene programs that no one is looking at."
They're being broadcast at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the licence fee, Johnson said to the Commission: "I urge you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the best of it.
Of course, we all think that £150 a year is a big sum, but for people with £150 a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look at the BBC so much.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared in front of the commission on Tuesday, said that the BBC should review its Reith mission in the sense of "information, education and entertainment."
He confirmed that the small production volume of BBC was now already classified as an educational - it was 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and should take the role of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "information, clarification and entertainment".
On the subject of the Elstein partnership, the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast only a handful on TV, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
Sonogenetics or brain cell control by sound waves
This video shows how audio impulses affect the direction of the patrols.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
The tiny nebulae change direction when they are affected by sound impulses that are unheard of for the human ear.
The pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity through light
Scientists reported that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates itself outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes are introduced into the patient's brain that stimulate the brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The nebula usually does not respond to ultrasound, but the Chalasani found that the reaction would occur when they placed them in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, bubbles amplify ultrasound waves, which then pass through the body of worms.
Increased ultrasound waves operate in TRP-4 ion channels, located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open up and activate the cells they are connected to, says the report of the magazine Nature Communications.
In order to control the nebulae by means of ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
When he used ultrasound on such modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they switched on modified motor neurons.
The new method is similar in many ways to optogenetics, a pioneer tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, heard that soogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike the light that must be sent by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Advertisers embarrassing the British arms trade.
Check out Amnesty International's anti-weapon market video.
Terror killing drones!
Leg chains that break ankles!
Missile missiles!
And electric stun batons that cause insufferable pain, but leave no trace!
A cheerful voice and a cartoon metaphor leave no doubt that this ad at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the UK government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defence and security equipment of the International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in the Docklands district of London.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with postering at bus stops and metres that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling to DLR from September 15 to September 18?" reads one, using a letter with a mark of the London Metro with DLR lines becomes a picture of the tank.
In September this year, a bunch of arms dealers will descend on DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their works at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collective called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute all over London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen Key, which allegedly "will gain access to about a third of the advertising area of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not entertained by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists increasingly question and try to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists switch to working with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world to have their art impact on society.
Another one of the posters against the arms trade in the health of passengers on the subway.
The video Amnesty was seen on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by VCCP agency working without a fee and graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
The creative director of the VCP Matt Lever would be surprised to see an empty spot in the ExCeL calendar, and he thought, "Let's show them a campaign that he's trying to avoid."
They used to play with creating a more realistic, risky, corporate advertising, but "by adding colorful colors and animations, we've achieved more people."
"They did a fantastic piece of work and helped us to raise our concerns about selling illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that the torture device is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military to "on the arm of the AT4CS RS launch."
This includes "a uniquely shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm
11 years ago, I moved to student colleges as an unnoticed 19-year-old boy who still believed in barets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I've bothered - and numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the track can range from mildly on the nerves going up to totally horrific.
It's nice to be babbling: telling people where you come from, if you take a year off, what you think of Corbyn, and why "you don't really love Marmite, and you don't really hate it, because people, it's just an extract from HAHAHAHA yeast, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It controls the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and those you wouldn't even talk to if your algae were in one fire and they'd be handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people some space.
People’s rooms are often changed to drinking receptions, movie evenings and public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress up and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts come to college in short.
Your room should be a haven, yet many colleges change into an extracurricular walk culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendship.
That could be hell for someone who needs to charge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can go back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to find out when the classmate is tired of socializing and maybe write him a knock.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
A boy in my dormitory used to be invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Since you started going to the university on top of baking mania, knocking on a door and performing with a plate of baked cookies seems slightly less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering homely delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe everything will end with your face assigned to a delicious surprise.
This is, of course, the subject of being a decent baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and solid will probably cancel out that the others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Food theft is a common crime in college.
Stealing whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is a drop of milk into your tea theft?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they go crazy inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate, who traded her milk as a dishwasher to punish the thieves.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noises that disturb people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors to turn down the drum and bass a little bit, because it was 3:00 a.m. and she had a test this morning.
Their answer was to strengthen the music.
When they finally shut up at 5 a.m., she let them sleep for two hours and then played her own music out loud, locked the door and left for her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife went to the same college as you?
On the contrary, would it not be terribly embarrassing if you confused your roommates for your future wife, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you won't order your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future wife, try to talk to your weaknesses a little bit.
At an uplifting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unsealed room, there's only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put the keys in the water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their things to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a rough time pregnant with a seven - year - old Vítek.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone for the preparation and upbringing of her offspring.
I faced the situation quite quickly - I was looking forward to having a baby and I was looking forward to it.
I tried not to worry about the uncertainty and being alone with the baby.
And I certainly had the hope that we wouldn't be left alone for long, remembers Eve's first pregnancy today.
She already met on the Internet at an older Vasek chat house, where they started talking about favorite films.
Your Eve and Vitek even drove home from the hospital, but he didn't get too involved in the role of stepdad.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva described in documentary series Four in that 3.
The motive of the third series of Czech TV series is just looking for happiness for the second attempt.
Care for Vítka and the financial security of the family managed thanks to part-time work and great help of mother and help of aunty.
Even the prospects of responsibility for a foreign child did not spoil Vaskova’s affection for Eve.
They finally got together around Vítkov's second birthday, and he now understands Vaška as his father, and he also addresses him as his father.
Even though Vašek already has two adult daughters, he enjoys fatherhood in his 60 ’ s and is also more dedicated to children.
In addition to Vítka, a two - year - old Leontýnka and the twins were added to them.
"Vášek entered our family in some natural way, maybe even by never talking to me in relationships," the smiling Eva thinks.
Not enough space?
At least we're close.
Emma's twins and Ela were born with an imperial cut after Eve was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of the pregnancy.
This is a disorder in the production and activity of bile acids, which then occurs in an excessive amount in the blood pregnant and is manifested in particular by itching.
The disease is dangerous for an unborn child at risk of premature childbirth and death, usually spontaneously disappearing in the mother after birth.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eve and Vaskova, although they were only at week 36.
They placed E.M. in the incubator at the media department, where Vaškova's niece also works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elenka was bigger, and right after the transfer from ICU to the room, I had her in my room, describing the difficult times after Eva's birth.
She spent 20 days in the hospital until the doctors agreed to release the babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two pounds.
But waiting for children in Eve’s hospital was not a joy.
"I was crazy about my husband and kids," remembers the hard times in the department six Sundays, four times the mother.
She also considered signing a reverse with her husband, including because of the insensitive attitude of one of the doctors.
But it didn’t happen after all, and the doctors released Eve and the twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancys and births are broadcast by CT1 on Tuesday night at 21:45.
Quite a large family can be tamed.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to do with an electric two-cylinder and tight conditions.
The house did not increase, but Vasek made Eve happy by installing a gas cooker to make preparing meals for six people more comfortable.
If it's hard, we'll take turns taking a cab.
Eva is convinced that children are especially aware of family well-being and pleasant atmosphere, not the size or deludedness of the house.
For now, we've been laying down very nicely, better than we expected.
While the mess is worse to hide in a small space, we sometimes cross the rolling babies, but at least we're all close by, Eva smiles, who can find a positive side to any situation.
Vaskov's work of lighting company in the film is not a guarantee of regular intake.
That's why he sometimes goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In his 60 ’ s, care for the family’s finances and children can cope physically, but how long will it be?
"I realize that, given our age difference, it will be me who will feed this family once," Eva admits when asking questions about the future.
She would like to go back to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
I'm not exactly the same with four kids.
And if it's the worst, my husband and I can take turns taking a cab, joking blonde girl.
Apple hit the yo-yo effect.
It's all the displays.
A more powerful processor, a camera with more resolution, a more solid chassis or a display that recognizes the power of touch, these are in short terms the advantages of the recently introduced iPhones of the ninth generation.
The latter also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The current trend of Appla was that every new generation of iPhones is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation whose weight increased slightly compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the disadvantage of the news was really negligible.
However, this is far from true for new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams in a smaller model, and by 20 grams in a larger model.
On the one hand, one cannot be surprised, the last year’s issue of bending in Apple’s pockets was greatly affected.
The scene of the news is so much more robust aluminum alloy 7000, which was also reflected in the weight.
But the displays have a much greater impact on her.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology to help the display detect the power of touch.
In order to do so, the display had to be equipped with another layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of new iPhone displays increased more than twice as compared to previous generations.
For smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams per 29 grams, in the case of larger ones from 19 to 40 grams.
In the case of iPhone 6s, the display is the most difficult component used.
The weights of only 143 grams are then achieved for this news thanks to the degreasing bark, which touched most of the remaining components.
For a larger model, the most difficult element used is the battery, but its weight did not change compared to the predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is seen at the display.
Weight 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
To what extent the new display technology will be practical, it will only appear when used.
The first users will be able to try this on Friday, September 25, when iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Have cereal breakfast champions been for tens of thousands of years?
In Grotta Paglicki, Italy, archaeologists were able to find a way to open up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlements by modern people from different times, including wall paintings, instruments and so on.
In layer 23A, which according to the tools is dated until about 30,000 years ago but scientists discovered something that very similar to the rest of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, traces of oatmeal were found on the site, which apparently went through the process of producing such popular flakes today.
In it, the grains are first soaked, then dried, removed, the so-called pluch, then burned and wet themselves out.
In the cave of Paglicki managed to discover grains that were apparently heated or burned, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least that is indicated by traces of use on two rocks in the cave.
Thus, scientists did not prove in their publication for PNAS that there would be a complete process of cereal production in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very obvious.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some fluid and quite possibly also warm is, of course, quite logically offered.
At the same time, it is very interesting evidence of how intensively people used cereals long before the creation of agriculture.
If the flotation is correct, the oldest flakes have preceded agriculture by about 20,000 years.
New reports of stations in the Brno City Transport Company.
So once again, I listened to the report of the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Přízvo, Frázova, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolleybus was a little louder, so the report by male voice was a little less understandable than before when the stops reported by female voice.
The woman's voice is higher, so in deeper traffic noise, it's better discernible than a deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that this speaker was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, I don't know, asked me, but I'm sure that was chosen from the studio recordings taken in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I've been living in Brno for decades, so I know the correct names of all these stops from memory, so I don't need this report, but foreigners from elsewhere who don't know in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended may be confused and may be at the final, where they accidentally arrived, then claim that the stop they were supposed to come to was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of the announcer - but better again the announcer - should be done again, and this time colored with the usual traffic noise and engine speed, in which the clinking of the speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So we don't have to listen to the names of Water Heršpice stations, Smírov stations, or then Ponorna in the screeching shalina that I moved to in Komárov.
I suppose my old hearing didn't get worse all of a sudden during the only day the caller changed.
Before that day, I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
It's from tracker's notes.
Today, few people know what the biggest and smartest party governments were so-called comprehensive checks.
I took the liberty of remembering that.
The bus was late.
I hit the dispatcher's office the minute the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't meet comrade chief, came a minute before you, and he seems not in the mood," said the dispatcher while I was writing in the entrance book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I'm going after the precincts to review the small mechanics.
That's not gonna work. Today's a checkup.
They're all fucked up. They're all fucked up.
What's going on?
"You'll see," the dispatcher slipped.
You'll be next time.
I ran out into the hallway.
That's when the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.
Uptight, with a stone face, in a perfectly uniform fit.
"Good morning, Chief," I greeted you respectfully and quickly turned on two buttons of uniform jacket.
"Good morning," said the answer, and I quickly ran up to the second floor without realizing a cold, sinister tone to which the old one answered.
"You're playing," said the engineer Eva, an elderly lady I appreciated very much.
They say she was even chief before her comrades took her down.
There's a background check, and you're gonna get there like that.
How many times have I asked what those complex checks were, but no one wants to talk about it.
They say they're once every three years, they all have to be there, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
I'll see about that.
I pulled a fascist out of the drawer with periodic reports and a phone in it.
"This is Holcman, come to me now," the chief's voice called.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met and nothing..." I mumbled, but no one answered me, everyone with their thoughts.
"Hello, comrade chief, I've come to your command," I checked in, barely entered the chief.
The chief sat behind the desk and looked at some paper.
" Comrade Mechanizer," he said after a while, without raising his head and still looking carefully at the leprosy, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the leper on the table, leaned into the back of the chair, and looked down on me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, slender eyes.
I didn't know.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised himself for working very well in the next few months and for being very satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the platoon at the distance.
And now this?
You realize you're a track distance engineer, and you have to act accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I've come across such a greeting since I was a kid, that I've been raised and that I don't see anything wrong with it.
It was like a red turkey rag to the chief.
"You're on a socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," said the inflated chief.
Plus, you're still wrong about addressing your superiors.
You'll say "sir" one more time, "sir."
But I'm not a chief to you, but Comrade Chief.
The governors are comrades of the deputy chiefs, the comrades of the chiefs of the track!
Remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... I greeted you with a simple civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of work or comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your priority that you're not on the side," said the cold chief, who, in the meantime, has calmed down a little bit.
That's what we're talking about.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a prepaid chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his priority, it didn't look good with the person in question.
For a while, he stabbed me with a cold, shy look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also upset by his high-profile tick.
He was only a few years older, and he played God, actually, comrade.
Poisoning, inflated, authoritarian, arrogant, as it was right for him at the moment.
They've all screwed him up.
So be it, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the president of the partner organization, like all parties, but also the non-parties, was touching him.
But the chief touched many, especially those with whom he could exercise his superiority.
He just wiped me out for shit.
I thought about my ass and it cost me enough to not shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to being a rascal again, let alone continue to be a railway official.
What would I do with two kids?
And a built-in house!
I've been crying, but I've taken care of myself.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all so far, you can go," the audience ended, and he began to look closely at the leper he had in his hand before.
They called me in at 7:30.
Everyone in the office was already there, asking questions about what and how, they said, "Yeah, it's gonna be good."
Only Jožin was bitten by how his custom used to be that they couldn't fire us all because he would have to do the work of comrade chief himself with his loyal ones, and that's not a threat.
The word "association" stressed, as if he knew what the old man had wiped me off for this morning.
There was a nice reunion at the chief's office.
Comrade Chief behind his desk and at the long advisory table, other comrades who were to decide on my official existence or not being.
Kadrovak, Chairman of the ROH, the accounting officer from the HR, a referee for special purposes, something against the military, and a deputy, my boss.
And also the person most important, the chairman of the partner organization.
I knew him from the stern.
The ordinary track worker, conquering the puddles or pitching pitchers with pitchforks.
But also a former guard.
Rumor has it there was no fun at the time, a pretty beast.
Bad languages said the school came out in seventh grade, he didn't learn anything, he didn't know anything.
And when the crime was canceled, he ended up on a stretcher.
But comrade, yes, the comrade was forged!
The chief instructed me to sit down.
There was a little soul in my neck, an insatiable cone.
Kádrovák read the report from the Civic Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so on.
So far, it's good, I've thought, and I've had a little better breath.
Then a report from the party's street organization.
He copied the Citizen's Committee's report, hoping they were both written by the same person.
But then it came!
Parents longtime members of the party refused to appear before the clearance committee and subsequently acted on the side, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me hard.
The castor noticed it and stopped reading it.
The chief instructed him to continue.
It just got worse.
I was a member of the city committee of SSM and there I was awarded a candidate for the party.
Regardless of the parents who spoke, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and I had a wedding besides the National Committee, at the church.
I've failed to trust the party in the worst way.
That's why I've been removed from the list of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, had a church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
All of this shows a negative attitude towards the leadership of the party.
When the cast iron finished reading, only knocking the chief's pencils into the tableboard interrupted the tensioned silence.
Everyone was looking at me hard, and I wished I was far away.
At the same time, I kept saying to myself, "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could have fixed the switches without some fucking clearance.
But now?
She took the railway officer's career as hers before she started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think that's gonna work. I'm sure the chief's gonna fire me for an hour.
"Second, how did you check with your comrade here?" interrupted Chief's tense silence with a question of cast iron.
Well, according to the previous job report.
Do you have him here?
Apparently, the cast iron wasn't over-the-counter.
In the cracks of sweat, he blinked nervously, as if he had been checked himself.
He nodded and handed over some paper to the chief.
"Well," said the chief with a hint of complaint, which, however, often used to be a premonition of the storm.
At first sight all praise, taught with honours, studied in industry, worked in task wage as a locksmith, met the standard on average at one hundred and twenty percent.
But it's important.
Where did you get that judgment, comrade?" he turned to the cast iron again, who felt that it was kind of starting to turn against him and that he might not even be a cast iron very soon.
This is where the comrade gave it to me when he entered.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the platoon in the precinct," said the platoon.
And there's no need for opinions, his was kind of an extra one, so I put him in the file.
"So when you were assigned to a technical function, this paper was enough for you," said the chief.
The iron was a nervous wink, and there was nothing to answer.
"It's okay, we'll discuss it later," said the chief and the castor.
For now, it's settled.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
He's suddenly blowing me off, so it's over!
I got dark in my eyes, I got hot.
There was a rush of regret and accusation, and I knew that I was the most disgusting creature in the world, which did not deserve the slightest mercy.
That by substantiating an incomplete opinion, I misrepresented a comrade of a member of the referent, and I did not understand why the judgment was incomplete when I got it from a cast iron in a factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element that, at the time of building real socialism, supports the realm of religious darkness, or even participates in it.
That, uh, there was a lot of stuff I did, or maybe I'd still commit myself, and quietly pray that it would end.
I didn't care about anything anymore.
I didn't care if I got out of the mechanizer's seat.
I didn't care if they took the rascal.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of comrade chief.
"That's enough, comrade chief," suddenly the party's chairman reached out and severed the leftist chief.
This is where the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did a stupid thing!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than that we'll shut his door to the side for a while?
To open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
An uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he read or parroted phrases from partner trainings and meetings?
That is why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who is to give it to him if not you, comrade chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat mistaken comrade in his efforts to correct!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of you!
Actually, it's a party duty for all of us, too.
The comrade here must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother not only punishes, but also loves.
When the Prime Minister was finished, no one even heard.
No one expected such a turn of events.
At least me.
"I totally agree with you, comrade President," the chief of ice added in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you had let me finish, you would have heard that this is the conclusion I was going to make.
They all agreed to nod their heads, but it was obvious that they didn't believe a word they said.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a self-referent on basics," I covered my head when I returned to the office and then I cried.
It's a good thing everyone but Eva's engineer was at lunch.
The silence listened to my incoherent recounting of fresh experiences, and in the meantime, I calmed down.
When I was done, she asked me if I wanted coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the stove and prepared cups.
In the meantime, she talked about cast ironing practices.
Like one opinion, often full of praise, they give a person their hand, and the other, in which there is dirt, will send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to be, but on a stretch at the cracker's house, so the factory comrades didn't know where to send it.
And our castor?
He only cares where he eats or drinks, and that's how it ended.
"He gets it from the old man," she said viciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Take care of him anyway, he's very vengeful.
And the Joint Chairman?
Basically, far worse chief, no human being.
Zero from a crackler with great power.
The water for coffee started to boil and the office then filled with the smell of just covered coffee.
I threw a sugar cube in the cup, and the silence was mixing a hot potion.
I hope I'm out of the worst place.
I'm not going to get fired now, and the other clearances aren't until three years from now.
Anyway, comrade chief won't forget today.

The symbol of the village came to life.
The wheel of the windmill over Chlum turns again after years.
You can see far away because it is located on a 15-meter high mast.
People around here call him "Chlum weather."
For the village 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the municipal sign which the village gained for the occasion of the meeting of the natives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at the time, and we wanted to have a fan on the mark of course, everyone knows it in the area," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a memento of the present: it reminds us of a time when people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries has been a rare thing.
Only in 1910 did the Chlumsian representatives decide for the solution, which then worked until the mid-1980s.
In the village near the branch of Čichov they had a deep well excavated seven meters.
Three years later, they completed the well with a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranice in Moravia at a cost of CZK 2,400," says the memorial inscription on the ground floor of the construction of the mast.
The pump after several repairs and the fall of the wind wheel served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the water struggle began to be written: a new water pipeline began to serve in Chlum that day.
The wind pump remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and its rarity.
The dominant was opened at this year's meeting by the natives.
Only in 2008 did Chlumští decide to repair the wind wheel and bring it back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - reduced by half a metre in diameter.
The bike was mounted on a mast, but that same year it had to be brought down.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel could not resist the gusts of the wind.
Then the Chlum dominant rested under the roof for several years.
However, since this June, the wheel on the high mast has been turning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the compatriots, the village had a replica of the wheel modified and re-assembled it to the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel only draws utility water from the well into the dead-end blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected him because there was little water in the well.
It was spinning at least empty.
"In the fall we will disconnect the shaft of the windwheel from the pump in the suction basket again," explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel got into the municipal character, but it is the only village of this kind in the whole of Vysočina.
Similar elements in the character are in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in Vyškovsko, in Kuželov in Hodonínsko, in Partutovice in Přerovsko or in Police in Vsetínsko.
No hard feelings, but I don't know Lafata. She admitted the backing of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the fight against Slavia very well, even my goal, like everyone else in my career," smiled the 34-year-old Goian at a pre-game press conference.
We were trained by Georghe Hagi at the time. It was a shame we lost.
I hope I give Sparta a goal now.
Only with the difference that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
This very man who played 60 games for the Romanian team is the key backing of the Greek team.
As a hitchhiker, he's going to face the invasions of Spartan offensive.
There's gonna be a couple thousand people, no hell, talking about the Greek fight of Spartan Hybs.
And in part, he knows what he can expect on Thursday night.
I know Fatai well, who played Astra in Romania with my brother Lucian.
At the time, I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good attacker, which is why he went to Sparta, said Goian.
The other footballers of the Prague club were not named, so came the direct question of whether they knew David Lafata, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and with a slightly disrespectful look he aimed at Czech journalists.
The helpless look on his face was, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a while of silence, he triggered.
We saw some videos, and I noticed Sparta playing a lot of teamwork.
He's got a really good player.
And Lafata?
No hard feelings, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
"He has experience with larger clubs, one can say that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is such their organizer of the game," said Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has already had the best years of his life, but he can boast of a very interesting football resume.
He was interested in Borusia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both the Manchester units United and City, and Steauy headed for the Italian Palermo, and he played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We're expecting an aggressive and unusual style, says coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European cups, fighting for a victory in the Czech league.
For me, he's a favorite in this game, but we're playing at home, and we want to start the band off with a good result.
Like Sparta, we're going to try to win, Goian said.
I am in a room with Slovak goalie Tomáš Košický, who is very excited about his opponents from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland because of trading in shares of the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the seat of a group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the framework of the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no real impact on the company, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the group's head office, shareholders are considering the location of the shares on the Prague stock exchange."
Due to the entry into the Securities Exchange Prague completes the prospectus of the securities, which will be presented to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the head office of the holding company and the related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction involving only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no public subscription shares or new investors will be offered under this operation.
"The possible offer of shares to new investors would be made - if the company and its shareholders so decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and in Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
A test of objectivity of Czech Television in the information about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of reporting of major Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time the broadcast of the main news session of Czech Television.
And how did she do it?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can launch today's broadcast of Czech Television Events.
The migration crisis has been dedicated to about 80% of the news broadcast.
Except for the first minute that the Czech Republic informed about the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on police officers called them euphemistically out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), already the current promigrant propaganda went - review the names of the individual reports themselves.
Critics of NGOs - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Travelling refugees - CT consistently uses the terms runner or fugitive and not migrants.
The most striking thing is that the CT uses consistently only and only images of young children and women in the illustrations.
In the same broadcast, however, she said that 80% of migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: Mostly propaganda, which has no similarity to communist agitists.
I must say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I woke up to a panel apartment, I soon stopped being the only resident.
My fish have moved into the bathroom.
Domestic fish, an insect with an imperfect transformation, i.e., not undergoing the conversion from a caterpillar to a beetle and the cub looks like an adult individual, only small and growing gradually.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't lick them.
First by hand and later by chemical means.
The socialist drugstore for their liquidation provided some kind of blue crystal.
I think it was called cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, they were successfully destroyed.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with some juvenalizer that the ants brought into their nest and then he wouldn't let the queen generate a new offspring.
But I turned that around.
As time went by, insects became the subject of my admiration, and I was increasingly inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have learned from my life that interference with the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace the other.
The truth about fleas and bugs, I'd probably not hesitate to make karma worse by killing them.
In the new apartment, my partner and I agreed that if the fish don't fall behind our necks, let them eat the peels of the skin, some of the invisible algae, etc.
Their peaceful existence was disrupted by a spider after a while.
It was a common kind of pilgrim who had long been based on the ceiling.
We thought he was living from occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only made us more comfortable.
Because he lived in our country for several years, we found that he is mainly engaged in fish and that his number was apparently maintained in an obsessive number.
We found that she was a female by trusted regular contact at every need.
We witnessed romantic talks with our partner about a third less, as he carefully calls on the webs' fibers so that he would not be eaten before he reached the desired copulation.
It took about three days for them not to move or react to our controls.
We found the remains of a dried male next to the female under the toilet bowl where the love play was played.
Then the spider hasn't moved in weeks.
When we thought she was done with it, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging from her surroundings.
They disappeared soon.
The work was eaten by their mother, and the work was scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she went somewhere else or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up again on the ceiling.
True, slightly smaller, probably the daughter of the native toilet.
For some time from the ceiling, she carefully observed our behavior and, by moving under the toilet bowl, she assessed our non-attacks as friendship.
On the other hand, the number of fish has decreased and the spider has taken a slow look at his normal activity to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed in a whole year.
Our daughter, amongst other things, reached the age when the use of the potty was already a disgrace.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've been eating the eternal pouring out of it.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more.
The daughter, however, found an excuse to maintain her habit in the spider that she saw very well when she was wiping.
Our talk of seeing a spider wasn't in luck at all in the house.
She cried and screamed and forced her potty.
There wasn't much.
There was a time when a spider had to command in order to develop his daughter's shift.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and banished through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt like I was throwing away a relative after such a long cohabitation.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and start to multiply with a geometric line.
The world wonders, a week, two, none of us showed up.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if the spider, like ants, was growing, somehow, that the toilet environment wasn't as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then there were the first pieces of medium size, and they were crawling again.
I had to come up with a different theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured out that their bond to the spider had to have had a reason to believe that if they didn't see it, it was hidden somewhere else and that they were at risk from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predator and his rapid disappearance in them caused some kind of alarming reaction.
All the more reason I don't have any illusions about their eyesight.
Some light was showing a spotlight, but that they would react to waved hands or quick movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
All we have to do is attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wish to the air, and I hope they didn't shut me down after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that cyclone B.
Ten statements by Albert Einstein, which has enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the past century probably never cease to be fascinated by mankind.
He could sink into everything so deep that the explosion was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
The consciousness of the people was mainly his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
Its clarification of the photofector or the idea of quantification of the electromagnetic field cannot also be overlooked.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of popular theory of relativity are so complex for many, that they prefer to choose easy ratios for a closer acquaintance.
But it's not easy.
Of course, it would not have been Albert Einstein if he had not found this in a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: The hour near your beloved seems to be a minute; the minute in a hot oven seems an hour - and that is relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing from his entire set of famous quotes these ten that literally impressed me.
Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, genius is trying not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experiments can ever prove that I was right.
However, the only one can prove me wrong at any time.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of a mess in the mind, what then reflects an empty table?
I don't know what he's gonna fight in World War III, but in the fourth, it's gonna be sticks and rocks.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and know much too.
If I had an hour to handle a problem that would depend on my life, I would spend 40 minutes studying him, 15 minutes analyzing him, and 5 minutes solving him.
The world's most difficult thing to understand is income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive myself not to mention Einstein's formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are expecting changes for 1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that all four of them are in black numbers this year," said Chief Stanislav Mišák.
At this point, the total profit of regional facilities is about 32 million crowns.
This is mainly due to higher remuneration from insurance undertakings, which are equally favourable for this year.
This fact, too, shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlin, the constructions that together will cost almost CZK 1.5 billion will be built.
The long period when we bought mainly appliances is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them the top health care cannot be done, the Regional Deputy for Health Lubomír Nečas justified the plans.
They look forward to changes in all hospitals.
The builders are coming to hospitals next year.
In Vsetín, the suppliers are now choosing a new internal pavilion for nearly CZK 300 million.
In Kroměříž, they have planned an extension of dialysis.
The Hungarian Hradiště wants to add a new internal for about 200 million to the open central pavilion this year.
And Bať's Zlin hospital is waiting for a long-scheduled construction of a new central income and internal income, which will require three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the major and often biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said Věra Prousková, the internal director of the hospital, for example.
The five-storey building there is supposed to be finished in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for both internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
Greater comfort for patients.
Changes, which are well known mainly by patients, affect all regions.
New buildings will replace those in which, for example, many people lie in one room, on the floor they have only one toilet, beds are inseparable, windows are leaky, and health professionals do not have the right conditions for work.
"For example, our internet was built 35 years ago and now it is at the limit of its lifetime," said the director of the Zlin hospital, Pavel Calábek.
In a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected to an urgent income.
Doctors and patients will have all the acute departments in one place, in addition in new spaces.
The same model is half finished by the Uherské Hradiště.
The central income is already standing, and the internet will be added to it within three years.
"We will pay the construction from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained Petr Sládek.
This hospital is the only one who can afford its own funding in the country.
The profit still has the highest, and it didn't get into the loss two years ago, when, for example, the zlin hospital was struggling with nearly two hundred million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we raise revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
The patients of the Kromeriz hospital will also see the improvement.
Within ten to fifteen years, he will go into repairs, new instruments and reconstructions of up to half a billion crowns.
This year there will be a repair of the capture station, then the extension of dialysis, or building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained to me how I should keep reception refugees in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister of Interior Milan Covancec (ČSSD) complains after consulting his European colleagues that the other countries of the Czech Republic are pushing for the adoption of quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but are rejecting any discussion.
It also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We didn't get an answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chowac told the journalists.
Can you describe more specifically the position with which you came to the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants as sacks of salt or flour.
They're living beings who have visions, they're going somewhere, they've got relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we were able to keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not get the answer, and that is why we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust funds for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
That's what we've been talking about for a year, and we're saying this is the way.
But saying that quotas will solve everything?
A few days ago, we were dealing with 40 grand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be 500 grand?
And how do we keep these people in the area?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost nobody wants to see us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese, and others who take the Czech Republic as their target country are to come to us with asylum, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is marginally close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't really want to see us, but 15 hundred people have already committed themselves.
Would it not be possible to accept more of them in this way?
We've undertaken to accept 1500 people, but on condition.
We said functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even with the 1500s, there's going to be 1,100 people to deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them just like the ones we picked up.
It is a big question, and we will debate this with Europe whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece or Hungary.
Because Europe is acting in such a way that, if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it can happen that we will not even keep the 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go back to Germany after they arrive.
If we can detain them during the asylum procedure, we will handle the asylum procedure with them.
If the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent of the European statistics provide international protection.
Then they get the documents that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will be resettling.
This is the second project that is still taking place, and there we have only progressed in discussing with the churches the possibility that they could help them get jobs, accommodation, etc.
But that's a long run.
You said the other states weren't willing to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
But isn't it that the Czech Republic just rejects quotas, but offers no solidarity step to unlock the debate?
And what exactly do you think that's supposed to be a solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive to all migrants from Syria to join them, the report spreads in the order of hours across all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It calls for another migration wave that goes to Germany because they just don't want to see us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders - just to discourage the migration waves, to help the needy, and to separate the economic migrants.
Show them they don't stand a chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovans came to Germany only last year.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all sats of this state, including police, courts, state attorneys.
If we could separate them and not accept them or only accept them according to the needs of the economies, 50 percent of what the social systems are spending in vain on them today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's 80, the first day was 12.
How much longer is this supposed to take to get border controls tighter?
We were afraid of being captured in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we're dealing with.
We still have a few hundred seats at the stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we hold will be returning Austria within seven days.
We do it the standard way.
Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.
So where's the break point?
Would it have to be, like, a thousand a day?
I think it might have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, three consecutive days, will drain our capacity to the point where emergency plans will take place.
Then I'm agreed with the Prime Minister to convene an extraordinary government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in the phone several times a day.
If this situation were to happen, the government could sit immediately, and by one resolution, it would decide to strengthen the police's military, let's call it a customs administration or, if necessary, a prison service.
The regional variant is an exceptional state that has now declared Hungary in some places?
I don't think it can come this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen in order for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians are trying to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct journey to Austria.
The Czech Republic would touch it very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debt at the last minute.
He's trying to stop a bankruptcy announcement.
Football Slavia paid off her debts.
Football players have been able to get their money.
Football Slavia was brought to court on Tuesday for the first time on the basis of insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after the proposal was made by Online Services from the Pacific Samoa for approximately 20 million crowns.
The lawyer, Slavie Zuzana Mládková, tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
And it has to be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Jiří Šimána.
Apparently, money came from the new owners at the club at the last minute.
This is evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vrsov club sent tens of millions of crowns on Monday, just the day before the hearing in court.
"Everything was paid between 11 September and 15 September," said the attorney, Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
For example, the Slovak representative Milan Ivan or Czech substitute Maria Ličkov.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenick.
Already on Friday the club paid the due fees of the city part of Prague 10.
As a part of the insolvency dispute, only the claims that Slavia disputes remain de facto.
According to the club, the commitments were not made at all, or there were legal disputes.
However, we are ready to pay in case of loss of these disputes.
"We have the funds in our bank account, which we can document with an account statement," the judge told attorney Mládková.
"All that was paid after the due date is paid," said Mládková, adding that the outstanding liabilities were outstanding.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid those debts.
There will then be an evaluation of all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The Judge ordered the continuation of the negotiations on the third November.
However, the decision will not be taken at this meeting, but in writing after it.
Medals for Finns and Austrians.
FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of high-end technology, hardware and software integrated into modular construction brings benefits and rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set is always configured according to customer requirements.
Any of it, from welding of construction steel to welding of special alloys, as well as from welding of rough materials to welding of thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
The incredible amount of welding curves, simple adjustment and expansion of the welding source enables you to react quickly to changes in requirements, leading to reduced simplicity, need to rebuild the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with top welding processes developed by Kemppi to ensure higher productivity and quality welding.
It stops wasting time and does not waste material or correct faults.
Flexibility is ensured, there are less simplicity, more welding and more profit.
It is this year's news that premiered in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We appreciate this honour very much because it confirms the exceptionalness of the product.
The leading world manufacturers can boast of similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and parameter management, FastMig X is part of the world's top.
The delivery times are also pleasant for those interested, which are around three weeks.
We have already established first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will certainly expand after the Brno fair.
We have been his regular participants for over 20 years, and almost always our business results are better than before, stresses for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka went to build so she wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka got hit safer, says the expert.
Blanka Tunnel Complex was able to be built in such a way that there were no two landfalls in the Prague Stromovka, said the production director of Satra, the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovic.
He said it on Wednesday evening during a journalistic tour of the tunnel.
But he thinks it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
Drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel has been able to hit safer, but costs are rising exponentially," said Butovich.
According to Stromovka, the conditions were the same throughout the time, yet the country fell only a few steps from where it began to hit by a safer and more careful method.
"If the measure were applied 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," said Butovic.
Blank's tunnel collapsed three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is very expensive, he said to the weekly Euro.
The construction was intended to cost CZK 17 billion.
When we add to that VAT, which has doubled out during the construction period, you have twenty-seven billion of twenty-one.
If technology, land purchase and engineering, valorization and similar items are added, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from 37, said Bělohlav
That's what someone ordered and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with a new Apple update
The new operating system can be requested in Settings by clicking on the "General" tab and selecting "Software Update" (software update).
When ready, it will offer you the possibility to download your phone and then install it.

FedEx's mixed profits, reducing the fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfactory results over the last quarter and a huge reduction in annual profit forecasts due to low demand for freight and higher costs for land division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 55 000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
In that period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers on holiday.
The company's shares fell by about 2.5 percent in the pre-market trade 45 minutes before the Wednesday opening.
FedEx states that it expects between $10,40 and $10,90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, which means a 20-cent decrease from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
Despite an interest rate increase of 4.9% on average, which will appear in January. 4, and higher charges for land transport of heavy or large parcels starting in November.
The company stated that it still expects an increase in profit compared to the previous year due to a decrease in costs, higher incomes and growth in online trade.
The Chairman of the Board and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "has shown firm performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing and global trade industries."
The rental plans were announced on the day after UPS’s rival company stated that it planned to hire between 90,000 and 95,000 additional workers, which is about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx won $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
The sales increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts questioned by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been affected by a decline in priority international shipping, which has led to a stagnation of revenue in its Express Unit.
But boom in online shopping strengthened the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land revenue increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while the profit fell in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In the pre-market deal about an hour before the opening of FedEx's shares, they dropped by $3.85 or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesdays with a fall of 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the record of June 11th.
At its most awaited meeting over the years, federal reserve legislators will spend two days this week based at 27 feet long Honda Mahagon table and will decide if, after almost ten years, the time has come to raise the key interest rate.
On top of them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-storey meeting room will be the wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder of the fact that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: maximize American employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have recognised that there is an unwritten third term of office: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be too close to the predictable decision to be notified on Thursday whether the American economy is ready to launch in withdrawal from unprecedented stimulus in the form of almost zero short-term on-the-spot interest rates from the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows solid growth in the economy, recent turbulence in world financial markets could already frighten the Feds by adding to instability by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - no more than just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economist of the broker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse to not increase the measure, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient justification to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself causes nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently asked by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% of the chances of an increase.
This would point to the decline in the stock market if the Fed increases its rates only if the politicians reduce the fall by the promise that the next increase is out of sight.
On Tuesday's industrial average Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, at 16 599.85.
The assembly was triggered by the expectation that the Fed politicians would delay the rates this week in peace, says John Lonski, the main economist in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed would now raise the rates," he says.
If the Fed's politicians would do it, "they would have to go to the extremes in their program statement and hold hands on the financial markets so they wouldn't panic."
Other experts claimed that the increase in tariffs would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty from how the Fed will proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the right track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said that over the spring and early summer, despite complaints from liberals, more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the labour market has experienced strong growth this year.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to what the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage profits showed signs of uplifting.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank's annual target of 2%, the Fed's politicians argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "is able to cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the principal economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world began to drop at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones dropped by up to 16% below its record value in May when investors feared that China’s slowing economy would go down to global growth.
The market is somewhat reflected this month and Dow is now losing only almost 10% of the May maximum.
The Fed’s political factors are concerned about the market situation and provide a comprehensive calculation of how to start an increase in the interest rate.
"In the absence of what happened in the financial markets and reports of China's economic weakness in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening up at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Head of Researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
He now predicts that he will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact that this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data that they can rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed became the monetary authority of the whole world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint of then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "use" their monetary expansion on the market, triggered cramps all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely connected, representatives of the Fed can also be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but they also consult with other central bankers and experts in order to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for wealth-management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of excessive movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic foundations."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy-making, who pushed for the increase in tariffs, quoted the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings "Though limited identifiable effects on growth in the USA," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed's representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prefer financial stability concerns only during a major crisis, such as the market collapse of 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Committee on Rates at the Bank of England.
The latest heat is not even close to this level, he said.
"You certainly do not want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets got angry," said Posen, President of the Institute for International Economy Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/storage was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/storage is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian refreshments, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part if you need some motor oil.
The deal's massive, and it's gonna take you over an hour to climb all the alleys.
If you're hungry for all this shopping, go get some food at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal shopping stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has different collection sites.
What's in the warehouse: do you need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in large quantities.
The range of fresh products includes special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and more.
The spread of the meat is great, for example, fish - staff behind the counter will wash and bone you, even fry it if you wish it,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezing section where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, free-sales preparations and more.
Who shopping here: Owners of restaurants and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
The broad streets are facing shopping carts and forklifts.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the cashier stand.
Located: The shop is in the industrial area of Los Angeles, surrounded by suburbs of Chinatown and centers - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be occupied, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the highways stays the same.
The House rejected the acceleration of 150 km/h.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum allowed speed up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided to accept the Senate's amendment, which refused to increase speed.
The amendment to the Land Communications Act will now head for the President.
President Miloš Zeman said that by the end of April he would veto the law allowing for a 90-mile-long speed.
Dan ťok (for ANO) was also opposed to the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built at such speed.
Tue Tuesday before the Members supported the Senate version of the Act.
The amendment now approved will allow, in line with the original government proposal, an increase in speed from 90 to 110 km per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-speed roads.
The House first extended this possibility to motorways, which could be used in selected sections of speeds up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
The Members have now agreed to his proposal.
The senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport, also removed the authorisation of the transport police to have the final word when modifying the local communications that the municipalities care about.
The Senate version approved by the House also includes the possibility of storing the sewerage, the waterlines or the public lighting cables longitudinally below the surface of the roads.
The village would have saved up for the purchase of the land.
Also, municipalities should not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, irrespective of the owner of the relevant land.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and facilitate the management of towed vehicles for which owners do not apply.
Newly, the municipalities could sell towed vehicles which, within a six-month period of notification of the tow, do not apply to their owners.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport across their territory on the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of fines and also for freight forwarders.
The amendment also cancels the possibility of introducing electronic motorway stamps instead of existing paper, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The U.S. Exprimator is going to court.
He's been in danger for ten years for overindulging his citizens.
The case concerns the allegedly overestimated welcome project.
Police wanted to prosecute Mrs Zuzana Kaila (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not issue her.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both up to ten years of prison are at risk.
The main makeup is scheduled for two days of October.
According to the U.S. Attorney Mandik and Maciek, at least one million crowns were damaged, resulting from the prosecution.
The plaintiff is leaning on an expert opinion.
Former city management members, according to the plaintiff, have unduly enabled the company which organised the welcome of the citizens to benefit from their duties.
According to the prosecution, the head of the department of the city services, education and culture department, ordered him to address five connected companies in the selection procedure.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, the city hall cancelled the competition.
The city was then to entrust the order to the administrator and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both accusations conducted in order to ensure that Darothore was awarded a public contract to organise an event Welcome of citizens to Ústí nad Labe for a long time and coordinatedly acted at least against the requirement for a proper economy care procedure, writes the U.S. Attorney.
At the same time, they were aware that Darothore would then, after obtaining this contract, charge Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the event Welcome of Citizens a price that would be disproportionately higher than the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the project file, the company collected more than five million crowns.
In the end, the city paid only one part, approximately CZK 1.7 million, and then it resigned from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was overpriced by at least one million crowns.
The Mandik has previously rejected any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this case, said the former mayor, with the fact that the city under his leadership was merely based on a similar project from past years.
The event was organised by Roxy II between 2008 and 2010.
"It was on the same terms, with the same money," said the Mandik.
The criminals originally wanted to charge Mrs Kailo, who was also a member of the city council.
But the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it to prosecute.
Therefore, the criminalists have postponed the case in her case, but they count on Kailo to accuse her after her parliamentary mandate has ended.
The welcome was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for CZK 5,000 to buy children’s needs and small gifts.
Hungarian police officers reportedly let a dog on the run.
Then they got the press to delete the record.
The Hungarian police reportedly arrested the cameraman of the AP agency shortly at the border with Serbia and forced him to delete the footage of a police dog allegedly hit the ground of a fugitive.
However, the Hungarian Government is questioning this accusation.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night when cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the corn field near the Hungarian town of Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
Cops have been arrested against refugees, and one of them has had a Syrian attack a dog with a basket on his nose.
A dog of a man who shouted, "Please, I'm a fugitive," said Muzi.
Muzi's filming everything, he noticed one of the police officers and wouldn't let him go.
The reporter was not allowed to call his superiors or his colleagues on the spot.
The Muzi cops took him to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
The music thus lost the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt threatened because there were dogs nearby.
AP sent a letter of protest to the Hungarian Government spokesperson Zoltan Kovács.
She described the behavior of police officers as unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not fearing that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
Kovács questioned Muzi's presentation of events with appeal to the police report.
He said the cops just wanted the reporter to show them if they were on some footage, which they said they had a right to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to do anything.
"The dogs can bark - they are trained to scare away and a little bit of fear, but they did not attack with certainty," Kovács says.
Unforeseeable Champions League.
The winner of the city will kick us, believes the Juventus
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserve to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, coach of the hometown.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Not one team created a lot of opportunities, but we've had the ball on the ground for a long time.
"The cause of defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," said Pellgrini, whose team scored in the competition after 636 minutes.
The finalist of the last season Juventus at this was exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian League, as a defender of the title has only a point and with a score of 2:4 is located on the 16th place table.
That's why turning to Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will mentally help us, it will kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances before the new year - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Manchukich, and Morat.
"That's right, this victory is extremely important, and hopefully it's the way we're going to get on the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, especially in the attack phase.
That's what my players deserve.
"Before our goal, we could have recovered at 0:2, but Gianluigi held us," said coach Allegri of goalkeeper Buffon.
"We burned a few good chances," lamented Yayu Toury, City's backup.
We must take experience from the League of Champions and try to achieve a better outcome next time.
Goodbye, Angela, goodbye, old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that all this media shivering around is run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, the newspapers and media are full of kids carrying an exodus on their parents' dusty journeys.
And this automatically creates a sense of guilt and compassion in man - in the sense of European man.
Well, they don't just come here desperate kids, notice on the shots of landing boats to the Greek islands that the kids can't see so much!
Well, we've had pictures of ships heading to Lampedus recently from the French border near Menton, with thousands of young men lying near the beautiful promenade.
Most of the young blacks.
And also the pictures from Callais, where these eat, and black men wait for them to climb through the tunnel below La Manche.
I don't think he's getting it anymore.
Even the pictures of the primitive Church of Eritrea did not make a special impression on the people of Europe.
There was too much phony.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it sort of conceals itself that it is not only unfortunate children from Syria, but also about stable ones - for the elders: fashionably dressed - young men.
Whose musculatures look like they just came out of some fitcentre.
Only one personal experience.
This summer on Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on a private beach hotel.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no ham.
And from them came the young black.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went into the beach, all the clothes in designer clothes and shoes, in the hands of, like, smartphones.
That it is a private beach, they were not interested and employees - Turks, Muslims! - were clearly afraid of them.
They've taken all the deckchairs.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was just in the sea had bad luck.
They were dressed like an American rapper movie.
On the head of a hat with a nail, white and colored adidas on the legs.
Then the local beach bar besieged and started to breed.
They occupied the tables around, stuffed themselves next door to the sitting and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace in peace.
Incoming blacks drank beer from threes - how in US shows? - on the beach they threw empty bottles around.
They kept yelling loudly at each other.
It wasn't English, of course.
Then they put themselves in a drink of wine, also made of bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in the branded swimmers, especially the young ladies - in the water they were screaming and screaming, mothers with children and pensioners fled horribly and in half an hour there was not a single black guest on the beach or in the pool.
Everyone's gone.
No matter if anyone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel employees were afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said half-voiceful to me in the evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they definitely didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had a 20-inch massive cross of gold on his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Are these drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen them drink," said the waiter.
Drugs don't smuggle, they don't use.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I figured out what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105, it wasn't that important to me.
I had no idea what was gonna happen next.
But secret services and top politicians should know first.
They don't seem to know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were sent to Europe at that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today it has proved that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and linked lobbyist and economically important groups in Europe have the greatest power.
Germany and its politicians - the already recognised main force in Europe - are lying, lying and lying - but not just them, the EU's tops and televisions, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of the pictures of Moscow TV from August 1968.
Sure, there were some sunshines at the station, but mostly - the ancient German - Muslims welcomed their souquons.
For weeks they were babbling on the news on Czech TV, as according to some research Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
Of course, who's only been in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms more information.
For example, famous research public opinion organized by ARD - Czech Association public law television company Federal Republic Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of the Germans wanted to receive even more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TVs reported.
However, they concealed what broke the next day in Germany: it turned out that 94.5% of the Germans do not want any more immigrants - the polls were attended by 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago, that "our efforts to achieve a ‘multi-culti’ society have failed."
Then she said, "Germany gives up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts to achieve such coexistence have failed."
In a country where there are four million Muslims, she says that strategy has failed to enable people from different cultural backgrounds to live together without being integrated. Today they live here with us and we have lied for a while that they will not stay, that they will disappear again one day.
That's not real.
A multicultural approach where we think that we just live happily together, so this approach failed.
He totally failed.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euro-German Schulz, President of the European Parliament, Member of the SPD, the only one who is reportedly not even a senior in the Euro-Parliament - yes, this is the one that Berlusconi in the EU said he could have played a concentration overseer for a minute - as he has already demonstrated.
It seems, especially under the impression of the last statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed Rubicon.
Note that, with the exception of some, the majority of European politicians do not support these statements, the states of the countries that have been victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful, solid Germans?
Who have spent years trying, at least on the outside, to deal with their horrific past, the aggressor and the murderer of millions?
Are those who say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is in Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped all of his power from trying to control the entire centre of Europe?
When did he say the Grand German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he should have.
When he was suspended, the preparation for World War I began.
The idea of Great Germany, which led Germany and Europe to two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in another form.
After the Marxist attempt to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the NDR failed, in Germany, on the basis of, for example, ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism, a new German ideology began to develop.
We'd say sunshine.
German elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, leaving alone all those fighters against the atom, the enthusiasts seeking paradise for everyone, silently supporting the old imperial and Nazi password Our forest must live.
In order to satisfy the restless young people who everywhere want to do something differently and better, they have fully leaned towards the fight against the heating of the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and an anti-Slovan current that considers all the Slavs to be a difficultverb - since Karl Marx, who, after his parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the last statements of Schulz and the German ministers show, openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of a leader of Germany.
Which must be obeyed without absolution.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And if we add to that that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
As always, the capital, especially the German one, is in line with the fact that Germany, through banks and the Union, is in fact controlling most of Europe's countries.
First, the Sunflowers’ pseudore led the Germans into the swamps of environmentalism and multiculturalism, and today she brought them home, possibly bringing millions of Muslims.
Who, enticed by the siren's voices, are about to hit a wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see and start to rebel.
Germany can only threaten its neighbours with force again, once again some of its inhabitants - but it seems that an increasingly small part - will wander ideologically, but eventually reality will catch up with it as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against incoming Islamists begin?
Where have Muslims long lived in Germany come to help, but certainly not assimilated in such a way as to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans engage in their country’s fear of Islamization?
What will it do to the Germans, and even to Germany, when people rise up who will protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-overhuman Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict, which instigated in Europe by supporting solar ideology, i.e. elitist ideology and essentially totalitarian , and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the infallible conduct against the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot be done well.
Completion tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of sleazy sellers is to scare them to death.
Just knock and the robust have knocked on you in a way that the weaker nature may not stand.
The living head will wipe you down nicely and drive you away stubbornly, accompanied (or rather driven away) by a relentless seller and a living statue.
Maybe it's a shame that a talking slip can't actually be done.
Even in our country, it would be useful to banish a lot of excavations and bastards.
Cinnamon (Oxalis corniculata).
A tiny weed that tolerates a dry environment.
And so it is among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is one of the expansive weeds, but it looks like it gives a nice impression about the flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
She's inquisitive, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, it's easy to adapt, modest, and not demanding.
Although creating leaves with chaotic composition, it is worth observing and taking photographs.
The beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves with purple accompaniment are just under the detail.
The Brazilian paediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy breast-feeding diet
The Brazilian paediatric society SPRS came up with a shocking way to try to convey knowledge of the importance of a good diet when breast-feeding with pictures of children sucking from their breasts, painted by a picture of an unhealthy meal.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbs, which provide infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new-born mothers are recommended to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected their children's genetic creation and protected them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets have had a negative impact on the immune system of children.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's is trying to take over the lead at the Today Show
With Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry to cover the costs of the escape of liberal leadership, it was not possible to create a sufficient increase in evaluation for Today.
Nine's morning show from national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's overthrow tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Army has been stuck in London as part of a week long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that this tyranny of distance matters so much to the audience of Aussie TV because it recorded on average 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers of Today.
Today recorded a slight increase in its evaluation compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was only past Thursday (343 000).
Today has been filling the Sunrise gap in recent months.
In August, on average, 318,000 were on Wednesday, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 viewers so far, and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds of change affect more than just Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are well, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand has on average a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
The critics wondered if Thomson himself could tighten a TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a clear "yes."
The X Factor by Seven kept a strong 1.136 million viewers, thus smoothly defeating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings of the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30), reported by Andrew O'Keefe, had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped on 623,000 viewers — enough to win the Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 viewers and a second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
Thanks to the fall in the second night ratings of The Chase Australia, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a Million Dollar Minute show that couldn't beat McGuire's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
Secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally found out who will win Bachelor.
The woman that Sam Wood is coming to Bachelor's house with is shrouded in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls that are left with the state will definitely not tell who the real girl is who gets the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they left, they unwittingly told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until the Thursday finale
All three women were singing about why Wood was the perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as the reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, in the question, "If not, which gets Wood's final flower?", their answers could function as a liaison about who gets Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one best suited to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been sharing a light relationship since one day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched Sarah's and Sam's energy, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really a land woman, she is a lot of fun," said Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're fine and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood and I could make a great couple.
She herself claims that during his last visits home she realized that Wood could be "the right one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized this wasn't just a game anymore - I opened my whole heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if she didn't, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say this," she said.
I like both girls anyway - it's between Snezena and Lana indecisively.
Bachalor is aired on Wednesday at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after moving to the United States and a lot of teams were asked about his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems like a reasonable decision.
Some trainers let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which he did convert the Australian rugbi league at the first pitch kick at the 20:3 Tuesday win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing newbies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, stated that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and only cared about the next game.
Already in the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne, he fixed his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught broadcasting when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian radio duu Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 the worst start of his career in NFL he could not even imagine.
“It happens, you’re just focusing on the next game, and that’s all,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in its own goal area led to a threesome of Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published a photo with fans, on which he holds the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Rus Vladimír Putin will meet in the discussion on the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested by pointing guns at Siberian ranch.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
U.S. was defended by emigrants who sought compensation for property.
Two emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the State for compensation under the Act on Extrajudicial Rehabilitation.
The court first assigned them the amount requested, i.e. more than CZK 2.8 million, but the appeal court changed their claim by granting them only less than CZK 90 000, referring to the fact that the amount of the refund is determined in accordance with the 1991 price rules.
The emigrants were upheld by the Supreme Court, and the amount they had originally charged was stuck to them.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay off the money, turned to the U.S.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in the social and economic conditions, that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - even though it was a compensation adequate in relation to the property withdrawn - today reaches only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of secondary participants as a restitution of entitled persons who have been exercising their rights since at least 1995 and who have not been able to obtain compensation earlier," explained the judge, rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, why the U.S.S. took the side of the emigrants.
"The UN has repeatedly expressed its view that the general courts should proceed in restitution matters so that possible inconsistencies are not interpreted in the interests of authorised persons and that the purpose of restitution is always achieved, i.e. the redress of the property injustice caused by acts of the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA now works by Radka Fisharová.
Radka Fisarová, by the way, became the world's youngest Eve, when in 1998 she played the role of Argentina's dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Prague Spiral Theatre.
To return to the same role, he says: "To this day, the challenge of Evita has not been balanced by the performance."
Because Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
Monica Absolone recommended her role as the first lady of Argentina.
I've seen a monk in Evita three times, and it's definitely been inspiring to me.
This is where I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I'm totally in favour of more modern modifications, but this is just a particularly good one.
"The directed by Andrew Sokol is original, light and current," says Fisharová.
The idea of handing over the musical sceptre between both singers will take place at the Birthday Concert by Monica Absolone on September 27th at the Studio DVA Theatre.
In the evening, they will culminate in the compositions of Evita's musical.
The experience will certainly include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Silute Your Cry, Argentina!).
Ondøej Sokol will also jump away from the director's seat in a limited number of performances when he represents Karl Roden as President of Peron during the film.
For the sake of public interest, further deadlines were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of the world musical Evita presents the Studio DVA theatre in cooperation with The Really Applied Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Under the direction of Ondrej Sokola, Monika Absolone studied the main female role.
Karel Roden appears by her side as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenachik.
Legendary songs from the workshop of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostejovský are given by live orchestra led by Kryštof Mark, who participated in the first introduction at the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after police officers shot rubber projectors at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in South Nepal after the police shot rubber projectiles into a crowd of demonstrators against the proposal of a new state constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhaka, a district officer, states that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of a police station and some were throwing rocks and arson bombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that the police used tear gas and then fired in the air before they resorted to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians have been injured, reports.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projects, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as less lethal alternatives, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This clash has been the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern land of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution and have mitigated their political influence.
Other demonstrations in Western Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which required the creation of its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have been killed in violent encounters, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial question in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been going on since 2008, but the legislators has accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week in Kathmand on the provision of the draft constitution and the officials say that the new charter should be adopted on Sunday.
We definitely can't panic right now.
After a loss on the ice of the Lithuanian champion, you couldn't even handle the home duel with the Sparta hockey players (3:5).
Aren't you worried about the same catastrophic entry into the extra league as you did a year ago?
I hope nothing like that happens again.
Folk Honor.
NHC predicts a 60 % probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verden islands is likely to be 60 percent in the next 48 hours in the formation of a tropical cyclone, reported the U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system between Cape Verde and the Small Antilles also has a 60 percent probability of developing a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added a weather forecast based in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to raise 11 million dollars for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it is launching a campaign aimed at raising 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who flooded European states in their escape from the war of the overthrown and the poor.
Google announced this on his blog very unusual way.
The report on her blog was published by Google employee Rita Masoud based on personal experience when she fled with her family from Kabul as a seven-year-old.
"We traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But the worsening immigration crisis in Europe is growing more and more families, such as mine, willing to help.
All contributions will be divided into 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all posts made via google.com/refugeerelief will double up to $5,5 million.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II, most of which come from Syria with a four-year war that has driven only four million people away this year.
Many people are also running away from the war-damaged Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetes, weight loss surgery may be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly obese type 2 diabetes people live longer after weight loss surgery than those given surgery.
"The mortality data lasts a long time to see," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an introduction to the new JAMA study.
The weight loss surgery, bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the stomach.
To reduce hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery was shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the study was conducted in people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the weight-to-height relationship, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values of 25 or more suggest a person's overweight, and people with values above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Hospital Min-Sheng in Taiwan have used data collected from a study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and gastroectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatment procedures in people who have been slightly obese.
The average BMI among those undergoing surgery decreased according to study 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, BMI remained the same for those who did not receive surgery for diabetes, at approximately 29.
Between patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the treated group, only 1 percent of the patients and in part only about 2 percent of the patients were completely resolved for comparison of diabetes.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol have also been shown to be "generally better in the surgical group," found by the authors.
Researchers have also monitored the patient’ s blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the continuous level of blood sugar in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, says researchers.
After the operation, the mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9 percent to approximately 6 percent.
However, in medicines treated by the group, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality at five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), reaching greater BMI reductions (7.4 versus 5.1) and A1c haemoglobin (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and were more likely to remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
While a new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden where they have found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people undergoing bariatric surgery had about 29 percent more chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study has shown no improvement in survival among surgery patients, Blackstone says it's a comforting result for people with BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here, this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group," he says without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously after the patient's BMI drop between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to show people the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think that once the accumulation of these genetic changes, which will firmly link their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to capture all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the refugee home countries.
The Dalai Lama dealt with the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He claimed that under the present circumstances, mankind’s interest should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to resolve the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"Take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bringing true peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also expressed his views on George Bush's accusations after the 9/11 terrorist attack and claims that "the US's violent response caused a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in President Bush's letter and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent road.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength to create unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have eaten a sanitary agent in the last four years
Toxicology centres around the United States reported an increase of nearly 400% from 2010 in the number of children to 12 years old who swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitary agent, according to the toxicology centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the toxicology centre of Georgia, the number of ingestions in children under 12 years of age reported at the poison control centres increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the E.R.," Lopez CNN said.
Some children drink a sanitary device deliberately while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge to the social media.
Videos on Youtube show teens drinking sanitary for cheap fuss.
Teenagers were reportedly mixing oral water with alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to an attractive scent of the product.
"Children don't think it might hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot more attractive (sanitation) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitary devices with the smell of strawberries, grep or oranges that are very attractive to children.
The sanitary device contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few elbows may mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is a highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, medical director of the toxicology control centre at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let a whiskey glass just roll, either, but people leave these sanitary devices out there, and when the kids get to them, it's a fast way to drink alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently at school ate up to four loaves of a cleaning agent with the smell of strawberries and was taken for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered drunkness in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency doctor who took care of her at the Guineanett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke indistinct words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the E.R.
Doctors were monitoring her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any sign of brain trauma, because a girl fell for alcohol and hit her head, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, mother of Nhaijah.
It could have been lethal for my baby.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to make sure that the sanitary devices are from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitary agents have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a sanitary agent containing toxic, undeclared ingredients.
The health professionals thought the product contained methanol, a lethal agent rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in North New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the room," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary devices and prohibited their presence in the room.
The police considered the ruined plan as "innocent gossip," referring to the discipline of the school district,
Ruma: No inconsistencies on the Celtic team
Griffiths is divisive about the clashes in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he's turning it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increases their lead over Celtice by 5 points
The penalty from the first half of ADAM Rooney's presentation provided Aberdeen with a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, which gave Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtice.
Griffiths denies the talk of dissent
This situation has provoked rumors of inconsistencies in Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for the fight with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're under any pressure. I think the players are looking forward to it.
Weakness in Scottish title rivalry bored the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers and former Dutch representative Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them anymore because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently the ambassador of Ajax, states: "In the Netherlands, they are no longer showing the best of Celtic games, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension at the Old Company games, and not just the people in Scotland are watching these games.
Turn things back to good, commits to Deila.
ROONY Dealia admits that Celtic is a little stumbling, but the Norwegian chief has undertaken to turn things back to good.
The defeat of Malm and the subsequent departure from the League of Masters was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now runs on the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has been through a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current situation.
We're on the same page, but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic's support, because it makes players so much better.
Now it's very important to stay together.
Warburton's worried about the January reinforcements.
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and suggested that he had already identified some of his January targets, the head of Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the large purchase of reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former chief of Brentford says, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
Players who come in the summer have a whole pre-season period to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Michu's transition target indicates retirement
The assailant Swansea Michu, who was linked to Celtic in the transfer window, indicated that he could retire after his contract with Swansea.
A 20-year-old shooter has been having trouble with a susceptible ankle for two years and couldn't find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1, when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this defenseman was cancelled later - it is the third red card issued by the referee Collum, which was dismissed.
Neilson stands up for his claim and says, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths committed himself to avoiding Tynecastleu
The stubborn Hibbe was strictly reproved after he admitted that he sang a song with a text for former players Hearts Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in the Roserburn pub in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a derby, and it was a entrenched moment," the assailant said and continues: "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastleu unless it is in Celtic's shirt."
Council in Tannadica believes in the management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United still believes in remedying the situation by the current team's management - but he admits that the decline on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boy for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes likes to be "ugly victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately stick against Hamilton Accies in order to manage to win the seventh league victory in a row and a five-point lead before Celtice at the top of the table thanks to the penalty from the first half of Adam Rooney's submission.
McInnes states: "There is no team that has won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning this kind of game."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged, while the total unemployment of the UK is rising
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged at 164 000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The rate of Scottish unemployment was 5.9 percent above the rate in the UK (5.5%), as shown by data from the National Statistics Office (NSA).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over a period of three months, and the number of workers has now stopped at 2,612,000.
Over the course of the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen to 74.0 per cent - a number above the British average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of State of Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest information: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland has made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have witnessed further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment has increased while unemployment has fallen.
Why I witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I'll be watching a man get killed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the death chamber of Oklahoma State Prison, and I'll see Richard Glossip, who'll be executed by a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials to witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approaches, I'm starting to get scared.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more applications than job vacancies, a morbid lottery is carried out to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will be watching the whole execution unbiasedly.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends and make a special bond to him through the months of calls and one two and a half hours of visits.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't have a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell the breeder's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admits that "she could have done better," but she still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here again.
I can't say for sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His crimes after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of complicity in a crime.
But I believe there's a high likelihood that he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that insufficient evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll be watching him die.
I can't say I'm really going to be objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you're gonna get from me is an experience to see the person I like to die in vain.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after getting the men out of Canning River.
A man's bet on Peter's escape to the police failed after he got into the shallow mudwater just meters from a police officer who tried not to violently persuade him to return to shore.
The Canning Vale police were called in at an incident exceeding Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them through the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He was standing in the water repeating 'I'm not going out, just come and get me,' said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use safer tactics and police negotiations."
"Sometimes people try to do funny things on the run," Castledine said.
The football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006 Cousins took a car to the ditch to avoid the bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peeter Moody accused the organizer of Racing Victoria that they tried to get a spy in his stable last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He focused on organizers and integrity department Racing Victoria and he was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with a late scratch of Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation as regards Lidarin's positive paint on cobalt that couldn't explain.
He bit his tongue on a spy charge for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it will all come out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you'll react and have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight, and I'm going to get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk upside down and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking the opposite, then I shouldn't be coaching anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Previously Moody launched a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
" 18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man who I'm going to name after a question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out the things that are being done in my stables," said Moody at Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because in an effort to catch me, they totally burned me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moody, current president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a few balls and make people outside of coaching take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt what I'm saying will give them the material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I'm gonna push them, and I'm gonna put a burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family, and I can leave.
Coach's frustration levels have increased with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent scratches in it have made it feel like "he could hourly his license on the table."
Moody, the most famous for preparing the undefeated Black Caviar champion, called the treatment rule on the day of the race "funny" after the clay or mud was applied to the horse's feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He might have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened.
It happened the day of the race.
Moody faced three months of disqualification for treatment of tiles on the day of the plant to which the organisers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobramian driver who ran away was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a cyclist on the weekend in Cobram and left after the collision.
The bike was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the main road Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
The police said the motorist left without stopping and helping a wounded rider.
On Monday, a 50 - year - old man from Nathalia confessed himself to the Shepparton police.
He is expected to be accused of not stopping an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic offences.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains stable in the hospital.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns a blow to the rivals for wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach of Melbourne Storm, criticized the actions of his players as "setting a plan" to two NRL's Prime Minister's favorites.
Trent Robinson, coach of Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to "fight" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team in the Sydney finals on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, the coach of Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly curved remark on Strorm after his team won the final qualification over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game the "review" of the rugby league and according to him two of the Queensland were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his confidence because his team is criticized by two head trainers, which may mean that they are afraid of defeat by the Storm team.
"It still comes - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were defeated 24-2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed any of our defensive systems and techniques in the last year, we've just put emphasis on contact during the procedures, and that means a turn-off for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and he's obviously been coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which might have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things always come in this year.
Bellamy degraded Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiere in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right in saying that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. It was also as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care at all.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game, which seems to him to be canceling, especially his young backups at their speed.
Such a football you would like to play if you had this type of player available.
This opinion he said in 2010 and now wants all the teams to play his football style - but not every team has two backups like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more confident because they say things like that because they're worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that more goals had fallen in Storm and Roosters than in Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are the breaks and not skewing experiments interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, it means we will definitely meet again in the phase.
Storm is taking a break this weekend and they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finale of the next Saturday night in AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold from the morning of Tuesday.
Serbian man got bail on $200,000 for drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for holding 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled from Queensland got a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of the five men arrested last month by federal police looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, who arrived from South America through Vanuatu and landed in Coomer in August.
Maksimovice was seen at a meeting with the accused in the harbor during the morning and later met with them at the coffee shop Coomer Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for the possession of commercial quality cocaine, Maksimovice's lawyer put the defense on the ground that there is no evidence that he owned the entire amount and that he could be in a cafe quite accidentally and innocently.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan thought the Maksimovite had fled.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the court.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and stepfather Maksimovice together offered bail of USD 200 000 for his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of both persons, it is clear that the USD 200 000 deposit is a real financial burden to them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their own efforts were apparently insufficient because the accused did not appear in the court, he warned.
Maksimovic has been granted bail on the condition that he surrenders both the Australian and Serbian passports, will report daily to the police and will comply with the curfew from 18 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Steve Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send images
Pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get pictures of child abuse.
Steve Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then applied to her online chat room, where he had a lot of rude photos of the kids he had sent him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found out she was missing a phone and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found some disturbing news.
The police were involved and saw five photos, then analytical computers found an address and discovered a "disturbed" search on the web using expressions to find immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was "put the pedophiles on the Internet before he "stranged them to be a police officer and scared them."
fiscal deputy Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was doing a search on the computer, but he claims he was just pretending to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was questioned about his conversation with the unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send others.
He thought he was doing it to lure them in.
He claims to be drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When a girl found messages on her phone, she called her mother, she was shaking and crying.
She saw immoral images on her phone, and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was questioned and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty of bringing an action against the admission or granting of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the terms of bail on 25 January and did not appear before the hearing at the court on 24 March of that year.
Gregor Sim's defense attorney asked Hogg not to be placed on the sex offender list because he may argue that in his act there was no "no essential sexual subtext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence for October for reporting social workers.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but was held in custody before the hearing on other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the sex offender list before the date of his sentence.
The Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the African oldest leader, fell earlier this year on the steps leading to the stage.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also defiled by the claims of the opposition legislators that they had received anonymous threats by killing them, warning them of the writing of Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was paged and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The President of the Members' House of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to oppose Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that does not appear, but is named 'death'," he told the journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and that their parliamentary immunity does not work once they leave Parliament.
The chief said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has "fear" about threats to MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is going to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancelling 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save business services.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster-growing operations in corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in the range of about $2.7 billion and the beginning will take place in the fourth quarter, says HP in the statement.
"These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, HP CEO and Chairman of the Board, who will be the head of the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and extensive business portfolio to help businesses move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual income of more than $50 billion and "will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will result in the distribution of the company, founded in 1930 by graduates from Stanford University of Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called "Silicon Valley".
HP was undergoing a massive reorganization to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest producer of PCs and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the conviction that a closely specialized company has better results.
The captain of the arsenal, Mikel Arteta, says that the teammates must get behind the wounded Jack Wilsher before Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger also stressed for Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason for him not to play again on Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next European summer championship is clearly uncertain.
The big pity of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after the ankle injury and then again got into the former form during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger says.
It's a wound that requires healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There's also an unpleasant pattern.
The survey carried out by Premier Injuries Ltd. recorded 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he had his game debut six years ago.
Over the last five years, he has played only in 65 league matches of the Arsenal of the total number 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the enchanted circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement in the reported injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you return after the injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a contest," says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out.
I hope his body is stabilizing, I'm sure it is, and he'll have a career that he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in Liza Champions at Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to spin his team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to enter.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” says Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite to the F-group, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not defeated in a total of 41 games after keeping the "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Richter on Wednesday night.
That was already ten this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that the Arsenal learned from the final season of the Champions League, when it capitulated against Monaco, and his hope remains that the club will lead to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This deployment is tremendous," Wenger says.
It never happened to the arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A comedy show that gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of similar images in various shows is striking in the eyes, especially given the need for men to open themselves more desperate than ever when it comes to suicide among young men under 15 years of age.
In 2013, it was the only cause of death in men aged 20-45 years in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (Calm) marked 2015 as the Man's Year, the aim of which is to challenge a culture that prevents men from looking for help if necessary.
In the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of over 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends represents a half chance of having mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, it must, of course, be achievable first.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of messages, the immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are rather isolated in reality.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game maker recently explained, money really doesn't buy much luck.
The beauty of the series Friends was a source of this thought for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities that glowed through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victim, a moment of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all the sources of knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
As a Samaritan worker explained to me: "My role as listeners of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the programs that come to mind when I try to offer a longer-term compensation mechanism.
It emphasizes little moments in male friendship.
As far as I'm concerned, the situation of an outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from closer, from a network of friends and family.
So if you are going to FrendsFest this weekend organized by Comedy Central Station, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior for the occasion of the celebration will be completely reworked.
Or when you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Friends series will be broadcast at Comedy Central Station from start to finish - whole 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG to mate Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after shooting a goal against Malm.
Angel Di Maria scored in his debut at the Liza Masters and helped PSG beat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the report on the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored on Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Liza Masters with a final comfortable victory of 2-0 against Malmo at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after his debut at the Liza Masters and this PSG player sent French champions after winning, then threw away a few chances, until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored the goal head in 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualification for elimination bikes, but on improving their journey to the quarterfinals they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they won three points, it was not the classic performance of the team Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was prodigal in front of the goal and later he was replaced against his home team and club where he began his famous career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the League of Masters either outside or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents a problem and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things we will have to improve with the season procedure," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we didn't shoot one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, who at home lost 2-2 draw this weekend with Bordeaux in Liza 1, but was in the fourth minute overshadowed by Di Mario.
The Argentine Wing was marked as a man who would shift the PSG in Europe to a new level after the transition from Manchester United, which last month, and showed why when he ran into the Marc Verratti Pass for the defense of Malm and by a beautiful ending he sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to start a spectacular PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs and got into this phase, joined with 9 internationals in the basic lineup and five defensemen and two drawn backups were a tough opponent.
But in addition to Nikola Djurdjice's missile, which just missed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in 34 minutes, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves dealt with the benefits of the attack with bad passes and a miserable ending, which was not good even from Ibrahimica, which could not even shoot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because its missile arrived in the net shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved much more appropriate when he came to prepare the chances for his teammates and it was just from his pass when Di Maria sent a rotating missile that ended up in the Wiland gate after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan head sent behind the line already the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic scored him after the pass from the left wing of Maxwell.
This put an end to all of Malm's thoughts on the possibility that they could profit from the match, and only the excellent intervention of Wiland from a great proximity has ruined David Luiz's hope, and the score has remained unchanged even when Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal was unrecognizable at the end of the match.
The coach of the Malmo Age Hareide team later admitted that the PSGs were a class higher than his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Liza Masters took place last December."
Since then, we've only played a Swedish league that's not on the same level.
Qualifying matches aren't enough.
Hat down for Paris.
For them, it was an amazing game.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for the sale of shares
The mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which was affected by the collapse of commodity prices, made on Wednesday $2.5 billion from the sale of shares within its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in its statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
This company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is facing commodity price depreciation, as China’s economic slowdown reduces demand and sparks destruction across the markets.
The issue of rights sent Glencore shares to a peak on the London stock market in early morning business.
The shares jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion is part of wider plans to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold a new share of 123 pence per share, which represented a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
So they got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about the extension of the Chinese growth brake have reduced the price of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities by 20-40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, confirming the White House in his Tuesday report.
The first visit of President Xi to Washington will take place on 25 September in response to a visit by Barack Obama to Beijing, where the president visited in November, has reported.
The American President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner that will take place after the talks are over.
"The visit of President Xi is an opportunity to strengthen relations between the US and China and encourages cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the disagreements of both states," the report adds.
Xi, whose first visit was announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the UN September meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address the disputed problems, including Washington's concerns about the alleged cyberspyping of China and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis spread the Schengen area.
The emergency flare set off by Germany was far from fueling the European crew, but already forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union has decided on Monday to deal first with the problem of refugees: it will be more systematic to classify migrants and asylum seekers once they move on to the old continent - especially in Greece, than to argue over the future distribution of refugees by quotas on the basis of a quantity that is increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160 000 refugees, the internal ministers of the Member States changed their priorities.
Before caring for the final destination of the runners, it is necessary first to filter those who are arriving today and to solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"The effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," stresses in the text discussed by ministers on Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds that it is at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increase pressure.
Renews border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in Austria.
This makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday has already served as evidence.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, although with varying intensity.
Hungary has taken this step a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
That it's a domino effect, but it sees the blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, in southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone inland.
The French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière intensively discussed this with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This is not a new idea, but a stiffening is being implemented.
According to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of the newly arrived runners were already registered and identified with fingerprinting in Italy.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point in its territory because it fears more than others that there should be camps on its shoulders in which refugees would accumulate on its account.
Greece remains a real black hole.
More than 200,000 people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as much as they have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers, who came directly from Syria after going through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge zigzag hole.
Athens, still in a financial upheaval waiting for a new government, put their hands in their laps.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and the source of common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Juncker's commission promises that the implementation of the checkpoints will take place as soon as possible, but it did not specify any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," agreed the EU Home Ministers on Monday on mobilization on this front.
The aim is therefore to deploy in this country the intervention teams of the European Frontex Border Control Agency.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its asylum reception capacity and strengthen island surveillance.
"The need will be adequate financial resources," warns the ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the emergence of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching.
The new emergency situation of the 28-year-old has, in any case, raised the issue of binding quotas and 160 000 refugees, which was raised by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year, strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was preserved on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the 28.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40 000 refugees in the next two years, which was already reached in June at the EU Hectic Summit, is Le Figaro.
Seven dead under the avalanche in the Alps, reportedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the German nationality is also a woman who survived as the only one of the eight - member groups affected.
Previous media reports say it's about Poland.
About 30-year-old female was hospitalized in Briancon with serious leg injury in the femur area.
The dead were mostly forty according to AFP.
"The rescue operation is over, the victims' bodies have also been transported to Briancon for identification," stated the Prefect of the Hautes-Alpes Pierre Besnard Department.
The accident happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the peak of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to the eight - member group, at an altitude of about 3900 meters, a huge amount of snow was gushing.
Today, the weather service has not warned in the area of adverse weather.
Trpisovský before the Braga game: finally a true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, in his cup premiere, managed to go through the European League's front-wheel to the basic group with Liberec, and now he is looking forward to having a good time with the team.
The Slovakian will welcome the 2011 Brag finalist to the opening of the main stage of the competition and, according to the coach, she wants to force her game style.
After all the nerves in the elimination fights, where every goal and situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're playing six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every scored goal, we can play our tactics, and we're not bound by just two games.
"I look forward to it very much and it is a true Europe, before that it was only a qualification," said Trpisovský at the press conference.
Bragu thinks it's a top team.
It will be very active, having all Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be more difficult to say that he doesn't have that name, but he has a player in his cast who, I suspect, scored three goals to Manchester.
"It is an excellent whole at top team level," said Trpisovský.
But he doesn't consider Braga to be a bright favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have shown that we are strong at our stadium in the home competition and in the forerunners, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Supercup in Pilsen from eleven duels this season.
They believe that Liberec can impose its style on Braze as well.
We'll have a team that's strong on the ball at the same time, which is unusually disciplined for them.
They play from the 4-4-2 distribution with a quick transition to the attack phase.
"He is a very heavy opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing is how our players will do it on the field," said Trpisovský.
We studied our opponents a lot in the pre-rounds, which helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted trainings.
"And we certainly want, even though it will be very difficult to play according to our notes," added the coach.
Student films take over Sand, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries entered their works this year for the 15th edition of the International Student Film Festival in Písek.
Four dozen of them, which the commission of students and teachers sent to the finals, will be shown from 15th to 18th October at the Portyč Cinema.
The best of them is chosen by an international jury, said spokesperson of the festival Jakub Charvát.
Every year, the festival has its special theme, depending on the festival theme.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year's festival evenings Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And, of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our little treatise this year," Charvat said.
Visitors will see the selection of the most interesting of student works - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, which will, for example, meet the winner of the previous year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Shard.
Festival organizers like every year are preparing an accompanying program.
Comes Wattian Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondrej Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ondrej Smeykal, turbošanson group Poletíme?, band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with recital Life at Bar.
The festival will host two exhibition photos.
The first will bring a graduate of the sand film school and a holder of prestigious awards, including World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrennerová.
The second exhibition will bring the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The German film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber with his music and the sandmen Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotný will baptize his new book by 3 friends from P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are its legacy, which will continue to live.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences with each other, and develop common links with the film industry," said the spokesperson.
The Pitching Forum will help to do this, where students can meet with film professionals, take several job auditions at once and get a job position.
The festival is connected with the creation of a Private Film College in Písek.
Its founders, the husbands Vladan and Miloň Terč, organized the first year of 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth year.
In the bankruptcy of the CK, insurance companies are to pay the client’s claims in full.
Insurance undertakings should pay the client’s claims in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
She decided on this in the middle of the House when she approved an amended amendment to the Act on the Conditions of Business in Tourism.
Travel agents will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee according to the draft which is heading for the Senate assessment.
Insurance undertakings with an obligation to pay client claims and over the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development insists on adjusting, arguing with consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to put an end to the insurance of travel agencies against failure when the amendment applies.
However, travel agencies also criticise the proposal.
Because without insurance, they're either gonna have to quit or go abroad.
The Minister for Local Development, Karela Šlechtová (for YES), pointed out that the cases where insurance companies have not paid full compensation are not Eurocommunity.
She pointed out this year's decision by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client was entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, stressed Šlechtová.
"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but it must have a limit to be feasible," said the Vice-President of TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
According to him, the bank guarantee won't work because no one will give it unlimited.
"Travel offices will have to stop or move abroad," said Kalousek.
Member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) agreed to Kalouska's concerns on the basis of a survey between the Member States of the CK.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance companies," he said.
The statement of insurance undertakings does not consider Okamura to be relevant, there is no official written statement in that sense.
They say they're going to find out if the travel agencies will participate, which is not a problem, according to Okamura.
Jana Fischerová (ODS) also warned about the provision, which referred to the opinion of the Competitive Association of Travel Agencys of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of stairs to Czech travel agencies.
Travel agents according to Fischer will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer says.
Her proposal to release the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) did not take the proposal back the draft to the committee because of the alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Philip drew attention to travel agencies that he thought might threaten consumers.
The rapporteur for the draft of Martin Berdych (ANO) withdrawn her proposal in the light of the Constitutional Court's verdict, which would limit the liability of the insurance undertakings in cases where they could not have known that the insurance payments would not cover the full risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum of four million insurance limits for travel agents offering air travel tours and a million-dollar limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The border will remain at 30 percent of planned sales from the sale of tours.
However, the limit of insurance provision will have to be such as to cover all customer claims in the event of a bankruptcy of the travel agency.
Even after the modifications, the standard provides that travel agencies will have to indicate, on the trips they sell, which travel agency organizes the trip.
Travel agents will have to submit information on the economy and number of tours to insurance companies prior to the conclusion of the contract.
The approved amendment to the Public Administration Committee also envisages further regular information on insurance undertakings.
Travel agents will have to provide them with data on the number of passengers and the tours sold each month, the total price of the tours sold and the amount of the advances and sales for the tours and the links to them.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agent has failed to fulfil any of the legal obligations relating to the insurance undertaking, it shall invite it, in accordance with the draft to remedy it or may prohibit it from concluding new contracts in the event that a breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of the customers.
The amendment also has to adjust the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the mountain service subsidy on the basis of its request, which will always be applied by the end of April for the following year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financing plan for expenditure and a perspective for the next two years.
According to the Association, however, the law-enforcement did not think of the situation if the insurance company terminated the CK contract.
She won't be allowed to organize tours, and the clients who bought the tour will lose it according to the association.
In such a case, the CC shall suffer a significant loss and may fail even if its management has been in good condition.
One of the options for such a situation to be met by travel agencies is the action for compensation by the State.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and on our market we will only act as agencies, said the Vice-President of the Association Jan Papež.
Although the proposal for an amendment also contains an institution for bank guarantees, it is so inconceivable that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, as the bank guarantee cannot sound like an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the Association, the change of practice so far is de facto unnecessary.
In view of the new EU directive, the entire law will have to be recast over a period of two years.
There are now 942 active travel agencies operating on the Czech market.
Only three CKs have ceased their activities this year.
National travel agencies will sell annual tours worth approximately CZK 20 billion.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must base itself on improving humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced it after talking to German premieres.
At the same time, she called again for the allocation of refugees who have already arrived in the EU, among the Member States of the 28.
We need to help countries where refugees leave or where they are staying after leaving their country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we are applying for dignity in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which higher financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations could be such a signal.
"The federal countries also support the German Government to promote a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis into European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg Dietmar Woidke, at a press conference, said that he was expecting real solidarity from all EU countries.
The long-term allocation of EU refugees on the basis of quotas rejects, among other things, the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also expressed their views on speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to begin the integration of foreigners faster, said the Prime Minister of Brandenburg.
According to him, most of the money that Germany spends on the care of a runner is also needed to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
More teachers will be needed to handle German.
It is a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if the runners manage to integrate, they can benefit us, he said.
Matt Damon's swamping the diversity in the movie
Matt Damon confronted the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during the discussion of diversity with the claim that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of HBO, Greenlight interrupted an actor in the Brown series, stressing the need for alternative views on black protagonists in the script.
"When we're talking about diversity, you're doing it by casting a film, not by casting a show," Damon says.
Shocked, she reacted indignantly to Brown with distrust and she sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown joined together a known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I would like to appeal to people to think about whoever the director is, how they will treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at the beginning.
The only black guy who's a hooker who's packing a white pimp.
The producer of the Dear White People was promoting the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to direct the film; Damon cut off that their directorship "could finally give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded in a dissent with Damon's commentary.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at writing a video, "Matt Damon jumped into the talk of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is YES WHILE it hurts."
Tweet has earned more than 5000 retweets and 4,000 liks since it was published.
Damon's comment comes when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After he was killed by a teenage Michael Brown white cop in 2014, the Black Lives Matter took national action and pushed lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colorful people.
In February, the singer Prince gave incitement to the movement while mentioning nominated in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"The albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent head of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to Fox News's personality question, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," said the manager.
Damon was recently reported on the list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope, it is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
Professional mountaineer and picnic Isaac Caldiero became the first to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and took home one million dollars.
In the competition that just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During this season's finale, two men fought to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb over more than 220 m long rope.
Britten graduated from the climb first within the set limit and became the first contestant to overcome the debilitating 4 section in the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero beat him by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for intelligence! News right after its hard-on victory and it was recognized that he was still in shock of winning the main prize of $1 million.
“It’s an amazing feeling, I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,” said Isaac E! in response to his win.
"So all of a sudden... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
The executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter on the course of the finals and why Britten won't get any reward despite the fact that he became the first competitor to finish the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the person who completes the track the fastest.
"If more contestants participate, the winner will win with the best time," Weed said.
Even though the gain of the main prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
“I don’t think he’s holding a grudge.
He's glad he managed to achieve what he did.
He received a warm welcome from his fans.
He's a great guy, and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife."
Geoff told me: “If there was going to be anyone who could have beaten me, I’m glad it was Isaac. ”
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season, which will start shooting in spring 2016.
The Detroit tigers passed just past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit tigers, the second half of the season was not just a walk through the pink garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is right now in the last place of the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers just turned away their defeat when, on Tuesday, they defeated Minnesota with a close result of 5-4 at Target Field Stadium.
The twins wasted their chance to approach the Houston Astros team and capture the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which for them was during the second half of the season so elusive.
"Wining is always fun and no matter how," said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
The tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive start and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed opponents 6 1/3 shots and 3 doubles.
It was only his third successful game of the last nine games.
"This year I want to end up with convincing results," said Simon.
"It's hard to get into a game when you're often sitting on a bench and that's why I want to get in the game."
Victor Martinez hit three times and made two doubles and his first draw point since mid-August.
For Martinez it was the first three-point game since the last June game in which he hit four times in a match against Seattle Mariners.
"He put himself in a good place," said Ausmus.
"He looked good at the training, he fired significantly better and managed to transfer it to the game."
Three laps at the end of the seventh shift gave the Twins the best chance to get back in the game.
The middle fielder Byron Buxton gained a shift thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
A true pole Aaron Hicks scored a point thanks to a set-up bat, and Simon had a look at Brian Dozier before Blaine Hardy replaced him.
Hardy took out his only opponent Mauer, and he had Miguel San's bat in front of him, who blew up the ball and ran two meters and left behind right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two players in the finish line and a chance to draw in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send a third metare over two.
Plouffe has already gained 27 circulation over two metres this season and reigns the league table.
Detroit held his ninth shift, Mauer scored two points down, and Bruce Rondon scored a 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-handed man has eliminated Sano for three downs.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in Phil Hughes.
Tigers gained three rounds in the first two shifts against a retired right-handed man who entered the game after more than a month's rest due to an inflammation of the back muscles.
"I certainly did not imagine such a start," Hughes said, "but during the third shift I felt I was able to pitch better."
After resisting the impact in the first shift, Hughes let Ian Kinsler have one point to the second meta.
Two departures for the right fielder J.D. Martinez were brought by Victor Martinez, who was the first to go around all the finishes.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 series.
The third metatarist Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored another circulation, but Victor Martinez was thrown when he tried to run to the third base.
The tigers added two points in the second shift when James McCann's pitcher and Anthony Gose's pole won two and then one point, and a 3-0.
"This got us to our knees," said the manager of the Paul Molitor Twins.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got him to the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of pitches, ended up on the third shift with no points and was replaced by A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three meters, got six shots and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right tiger pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who is on the list of wounded due to the stretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, should enter the Wednesday game.
Sanchez will replace lefty Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and join the Twins.
Since Norris was traded for David Price's left pitcher on June 30, he's scored 1-1 after 4 games.
But he hasn't played since August 20 because of a stretch of muscle.
Tigers and Twins will play the third game at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
The Minnesota left pitcher Ervin Santan (5-4, 4.73 ERA) is against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to strengthen growth, said President Xi Jinping to a group whose task is Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should be involved in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," said the central leader of the Group on the deepening of overall reform about the 16th meeting.
Promoting the opening up of emerging reforms will provide a new impetus and vitality, and will also provide a new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border control policies, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is important because it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, states the statement.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and will make sure that companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In order to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened up to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and protect the legal interests of companies financed from abroad and will provide better services," says the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card", thanks to optimising requirements and simplifying the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and the leaders of Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, a new bed section may be established.
According to Deputy Director of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Wawek (ČSSD) is the current capacity of the bed-bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
There are also possibilities to extend care in the region.
For example, a one-day surgery centre could be established in the surgical department, where, according to the concept set, the performances of surgical disciplines would be performed, which do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours.
In which specific hospitals the workplace should be focused on day-to-day surgery, it is not yet clear.
The skin department of Karlovy Vary hospital could create a laser centre with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic center to care for patients with brain disease who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be set up centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also a possibility of focusing such a facility on the Island hospital, where similar care already exists.
The next capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region, is post-care beds, in particular beds Treatment of long-term ill patients (LDN), whose capacity in Nezko is insufficient and should, above all, closely follow-up to the beds of acute care.
Part of this facility should function as beds rehabilitation and part as a classic LDN beds, recommends concepts.
As he points out, beds of follow-up care are missing mainly in Karlovy Vary hospital.
There you could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region, there are no social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are lacking in the whole of the Republic, so they could serve the other regions as well as the so-called Alzheimer's.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds to which European grants will be mobilised.
"These are beds that will follow up on the areas of supespecialised care and will create space for translation of patients after surgery, for example after cardiac surgery, neurosurgical, transplant or other surgery," describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
