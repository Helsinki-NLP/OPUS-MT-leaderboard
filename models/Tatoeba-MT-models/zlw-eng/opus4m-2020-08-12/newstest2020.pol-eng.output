Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic.
St. John's Masses for deliverance and healing are taking out the crowds.
He was a dozen years old when things inexplicable began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
St. Witko's mass for release and healing is to be held by the crowds.
One day, the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a hole in his heart, a size of 7.5 mm, came to him.
It was supposed to be surgery.
Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.
On the same day the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
The astonished doctors said: "Operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm".
My parents were crying out of luck.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The spirit’s extraordinary actions of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.
I was woken up at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at the moment – he says.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what was happening to a man who commits a mortal sin.
"My body began to change.
I've lost human qualities and started taking on the look of an animal," he says.
The invisible force carried him up, couldn't get his voice out.
He felt lost.
That's when God told him to save him.
"I was immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing the baptism, I was released and returned to human form...", he says.
He didn't tell anyone about this strange experience.
There was a vocation in it.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Renewal Community in the Holy Spirit
Father Witko’s healing service involves many who count on getting rid of the disease.
However, the clergyman emphasizes that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
Kolping's first failure to FRAC Jarosław
This afternoon (September 26th) the team of Kolping FRAC deserved the present Polish Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd round of the LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.
The Jaroslavians have no chance of winning with league rulers in the personal setting they have presented with the bulkheads.
He showed this duel with Dartom Bogoria.
The team's still missing, called team leader, Chen Jingqi.
With him in his lineup, the Jaroslavians may have reached for the third in a row triumph in the new season.
The young Asian Qiyao Han probably hasn't won against the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek yet.
Not even with one of the most prospective Poles, i.e. Marek Badowski.
The player from Hellada was the biggest star of a duel in the MOSiR Hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.
Both in a fight with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class of himself.
After three games, Kolping FRAC ran 2:1.
Kou Lei probably won Mark Badowski and Daniel Górak after the exciting, 500th fight – Pavel Siruck.
After that, though, it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
There could still be hope for a win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not meet Badowski.
There won't be any more tests for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafał Trzaskowski, a programme of free prevention studies for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be put into effect because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and its Submissive Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariffs.
In the explanatory memorandum, the Agency explained that the target group had been badly selected.
"Severaler actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to deepening the difficulty in accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affecting the patient, causing concern and discomfort related to false positive results of tests," was written.
The decisions of the Ministry don't understand the president of the capital.
"The money is ours, we predicted the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, they'll be going to a doctor later, which is absurd, because it's about bringing about a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All professionals know that this helps in terms of burden on the health system, because it helps to quickly detect diseases and in a sound approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"I find it hard to imagine that expert experts say, "Let's not study ourselves, because there will be longer lines at the doctor's office, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that there is a health service in this state," he added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
The Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced at the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements with Israel if the future government of the country tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the future government of Israel, which will arise, will proceed to the implementation of this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he said.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," he threatened with the pressure of Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights with all possible means – less important what the consequences will be – by engaging fully in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism", said the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, Israel's former Prime Minister, was re-emerged after the September 17 elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce an annexation of the Jordan Valley and intends to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank in Israel.
At the beginning of the 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements to which the United States was patronised.
During the UN General Assembly session, the 84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold general elections on the land of Palestine.
The last was held in 2006.
"When I return to the country, I will call to the West Bank, Gaza and Eastern Jerusalem for local elections, and all who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian President declared solemnly.
Abbas also defended Palestine's rights as a permanent observer at the UN to exercise the powers of "the full-fledged members of the UN and all its bodies and institutions".
The Palestinian leader ended the speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations in all respect."
Ambassador Danny Danon briefly responded to the speech by saying that the Palestinian leader “wills to focus at the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel, rather than fight against the calls for terrorism in Autonomy under its leadership.”
Danon, as the agencies note, did not, however, refer to the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands announced by Netanyahu.
Rescuers want defibrillators at the New York points of Przemysl
The history of the border crossing shows that the AED automatic defibrillator can save human life.
The regional emergency station in Przemyśl, wants such devices to be located in the city's newcomers.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulations from the Regional Emergency Emergency Station in Przemyśl.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Tax Office in Przemyśl.
On 28 August, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing point in Medyka.
A Chinese activist died in custody because of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, was called on 23 September by the Communist Party secretary from her home village to announce that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
Which was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
In Cao's morgue, she saw her husband's body slaughtered, unrecognizable.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were covered in blood," says the woman.
"They wouldn't let me take my cell phone with them, and there were a lot of cops around who didn't get close to Wang."
The police pressured her to sign a statement saying that her husband was ill and died of a "unfortunate accident."
105 million PLN for video gaming companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost 105 million PLN of funding will go to companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
On Friday, the National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the 3rd edition of GameINN.
Almost 30 projects supported by the NCBR included, among others, the development of a platform for the development of field games based on the AR engine that creates a real world map, together with an application that enables user data to be transmitted; a test-training platform to verify practical skills at the workplace and professional improvement using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game that simulates the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of Industry 4.0 – is provided in the NCBR communication sent on Friday PAP.
The objective of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, already today the Polish video game sector is growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion and the forecast for 2019 was PLN 2.23 billion.
"The specially prepared research agenda for GameINN and already 300 million PLN of support for entrepreneurs under this sector programme provide an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev," says the Communication.
The video gaming industry is an excellent example of the efficient use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The government's incentives for entrepreneurs to innovate, such as R & D relief, skills improvement programmes, IP boxing and support programmes implemented by the NCBR drive innovative companies and allow them to compete more effectively on a very competitive market," reports the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Science and Higher Education, Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The Head of the Ministry of Science points out that innovation money not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also stays in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs have benefited from R & D relief in 2018 than a year before.
"The amount of R & D costs deducted was PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million savings for the companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three editions of GameINN", stresses the Deputy Prime Minister.
Director of the NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kameniecki recalls that in the two previous grant competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million, 78 innovative projects were awarded.
The great interest of the third competition and the diversity of applications show that the video gaming industry has ideas and competences to further develop and enhance its competitive advantages.
"In particular, the fact that projects selected – as in previous editions – include projects on not only entertainment but also industry-related solutions 4.0" adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific entities could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of funding of approximately PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition was PLN 100 million at the time the competition was announced, but it was increased and 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million.
For more information on the results of the III GameINN competition, see ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
The NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Agreement, which includes, among others, companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloomer Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The event occurred on September 16th.
Dolberg, who arrived from Ajaksu Amsterdam in Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not just what, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
Angry Dane didn't show up for class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
The case was mysterious from the beginning.
The ballers in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, he finally confessed to the theft by Diaby-Fadiga.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Danish to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most prospective footballers of the young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a 13-year-old to make his first debut three years later.
He played seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as the newspaper "L'Equipe" reported, the club will probably solve it immediately.
So far, he's started disciplinary action against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this matter.
See if you're doing well washing your hands.
We all know that you have to wash them (e.g. when you come home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of the germs, you have to do it the right way.
It's especially important now that autumn infections are coming.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
And most of us wash them shorter.
Just warm water and ordinary soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise them off).
By washing, we rub not only the bottoms and palms of the hand, but also: the finger tips (connected or individually) – rub them with circular movements on the inside of the other hand, the spaces between the fingers (twisting your fingers, wiping your fingers on yourself), thumbs – each thumb includes the other hand and in such a hug we turn it a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency (when you cannot wash your hands) we should wipe hands with a wet handkerchief and then use an antibacterial gel (in the roadways, from PLN 5).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the handles or doors washed (recommendation of the Main Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it with a paper towel.
The president of Iran says he's rejected the US talk offer, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not discuss with the American party during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the offer made by the Americans to abolish sanctions,” said Iran’s President Hasan Rowhani on Friday.
US president Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian party that asked for the abolition of the restrictions, which he refused to do.
According to Iranian President Hasan Rowhani, the Americans have proposed to abolish all the sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear programme and the ballistic missile programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not make talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran said that he refused to take these talks because of the “toxic atmosphere”.
He declared that he had met with American diplomats because he had been dubbed by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not enter into talks in the atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1 format, no one is able to predict what the final result will be," Rowhani said.
The day before, Iran’s leader said that he did not exclude talks with the US, and the European parties to the nuclear agreement were accused of favouring US sanctions against Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US came out of the nuclear agreement “are a prerequisite that does not allow” to enter into a dialogue.
If we manage to abolish this precondition and if America endures sanctions and maximum pressure, then, of course, we can talk to America – he declared.
He added that he did not exclude a meeting with President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation during the UN General Assembly in the past week.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he was the one who rejected the Iranian party's request.
“Iran wanted me to endure the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said "no!" tweeted the President of the United States.
A voltage with an atomic background agreement
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to mitigate the tensions between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the 2015 agreement with Iran, which they were signatories to.
It stated that in exchange for the abolition of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons-building programme and that the nuclear sector would be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the agreement in May 2015, its signatories have often confirmed that they wish to maintain the agreement.
So far, none of this has worked out.
Washington is applying a tactic of putting maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran announced that if no export licence for raw material was granted, every 60 days it would limit its obligations under the agreement.

The Regional Administrative Court judge in Warsaw and the husband of the head of Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsApp, participated in the stalking of judges, was reinstated on Wednesday by the NSA.
Reason: Disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, so there is no reason to maintain the order of WSA president Wojciech Mazur to withdraw him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, disciplinary spokesperson at the NSA, opened an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not so far turned into a case against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its adoption.
In this situation, a judge who publicly talked about his wife's mental problems, to discredit her, who, due to suspicions of participation in the heterogroup, was removed from the KRS office, would return to the judgment and issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt is denying his participation in the Hetero Group.
He claims there's no evidence of that except for the falsified screens and the words of his wife he's divorcing.
That is exactly what the other judges say about the "Kasta": everyone is innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible they'll bet on their own.
Because the D.A. didn't nod to secure the evidence from their electronic media, she's also keeping quiet about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she stopped in June in another case.
The police did not give a finger to secure the devices of those who, as persuasives, were identified in Judge Waldemar Żurek's February report.
There is no evidence – no case of Szydt, no case of "Kasta".
It is also not the case of the head of NIK Marian Banas for renting a building to basements and concealing incomes.
CBA's checking his property statements.
And he'll check when he checks.
The Committee on Ethics will not take care of Banasie, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee on State Control has gathered somehow to take a quaint decision to dismiss the deputies of Banasis and appoint him as his lawyer, although the law of such a strange combination does not provide for).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American novel, I guess, about when my wife comes home and finds her husband and a lover in bed.
She's so astonished and devastated, she can't cry a word out.
She's standing in the door, and at that time, the lover jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And the husband made the bed.
When a wife gets her voice back and screams, "What is this?"
Who is this woman?
A husband calmly asks, "What woman, honey?"
It's just that there's a parody of states going on about Casta or Banasia.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the final high jump
Earlier this season, a brown medalist from the world championships from London 2017 to compete after a break, defeated 1,85 and 1,89 and in the second, 1.92.
1.94 only managed to get it in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first try was completely unsuccessful.
In the finals, I will have to jump more technically," she admitted in front of the Eurosport Lićwinko camera.
Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karyna Demidik were the best in the eliminations, after 1.94.
The two contestants were the only ones who had lost any height.
The women's jump finale was scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7.30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in a hospital in a severe state
He's in the hospital, and the doctors call his condition heavy.
He's conscious and conscious.
"We believe that he will succeed, that he will win again.
We all pray that he will recover," said the anonymous person close to Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with "Super Express" journalists.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for Senate.
"I am being held alive by the nearest family and politician," said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview, which he gave to "Super Express" journalists two weeks ago.
In January, "Super Express" reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been assigned to research at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and applied to the hospital.
It turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When a CT scan was performed, it was found that I had a cancer of the pancreas...", the father passed on to the Prime Minister.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki had a serious operation at the MSWA hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
"I know a lot of people prayed for me, and I thank you so much.
Fortunately, I don't think I have any metastasis.
I don't know if I'm going to be going through chemo yet.
I'm handing myself over to specialists who are rather good thoughts.
For now, after this heavy surgery, I have to get back to some sort of useful state.
I hope everything will be all right," said Kornel Morawiecki in January in an interview with "SE".
"If I were to pass the test too late, the situation would be tragic, and I would have said good-bye to the bad guy...", he added.

She was last seen at Old Guest Street in Krakow.
Nel Stoklosa is 14 years old, measured 167 cm, has blonde hair and grey blue eyes.
The last time she was seen, she was wearing a blouse, gray pants and shoes.

The power of the Olava jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports competitions, held on Sunday afternoon 15 September on the hypodrome of Oleandra Street in Oława, may be misleading for some.
The way to true power is far away, but this is what is called one of the types of horse competition...
The jump power competition consists in overcoming ever higher obstacles by the rider and horse, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed two metres.
It is worth adding that the world's long-standing and still unbeatable record, established in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the "Huaso" horse, is 247 cm.
So high in Oława, of course, nobody jumped, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm is not one of the worst...
The competitions organised by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists “In the saddle” were a part of the previously held “Dęczowyho jezdski”, which we write more widely in this newspaper, on page 22.
Eight amazons, training riders in the Olawsk JKS, joined the competition.
Four of them competed on ponies and four on big horses.
The first group was best done by Nikola Szłodra, with a crazy "Sprinter".
This small, but dynamic rumac began with the overcoming of obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at a station with a top beam 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three subsequent refusals was the jury rescinded the competition from further competition.
The second place in the ponies jumps was Amelia Pawlak, who joined "Famy", and the third was Lena Borun on "Harmider".
The youngest player of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles on the small mare "Carmen".
Even more emotions were accompanied by starting amazons and viewers during the competition with large horses.
The grave-looking downfalls included Paulina Szewczyk, who joined the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who rode the “Lotka”.
Fortunately, there was nothing wrong with horses except minor bruises or amazons, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young mare "Wineta" on the park had its seat, Veronika Łuczkiewicz.
We needed either an assistant coach or another horse to a couple, behind which a little crazy "wineta" went.
After taking the obstacle from the park, she also went down full of skill, so at times in boxing and at the gym it became dangerous. “All is under control!” Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down some of these frightened viewers, especially the youngest ones.
Since the beginning of the big horses competition, Marta Masalska, who has been taking part in the "Whisky" competition, has been excellent at the park.
This worthy mare, in partnership with an experienced amazon, followed the second approach in the final stage first jumped 135 cm and this was the best result at this point.
After a while, Paulina Szewczyk on the Declaration, Veronika Łuczkiewicz on the Wine and Anastasia Abramenko on the Lottery included the same height.
For the decoration of the flo and after receiving the prizes in kind in the form of equestrian equipment, all of these contestants went together and, finally, together with the amazons on ponies in the march of Radecki, performed an impressive round of honor, ending it with these interesting and exciting competitions.
Thank you.
The "In Siodle" Sports Club warmly thanks the sponsors of the jump power competition during the XVIth "Tartish Horse Racing": the City Office in Oława, the Waterworks and Canalization Plant in Oława, the District Mayor and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko cuts off from the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution addressed its proposal, in particular, to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced his cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Pavel Kukiz, but none of these coalitions occurred, and the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko was unable to even collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko informed on Twitter that he had completed his cooperation with the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will expect my name removed from my name from the KWW.
Please do not associate my person with the above mentioned entity," he added and announced that he will give more information soon.
So far it is not known whether the journalist will continue his work, or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4th, on the American Independence Day, the journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, reported on the emergence of the new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has been famous for running on the YouTube channel Max TV, on which he comments on events in Poland and the world.
"We're tired of politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the government in the country to take over the nation and rule for the good of the nation," said Kolonko.
The programme of the party included, among other things, questions relating to the judiciary (it should be selected in general elections), tax changes (comparing the amount of the tax free for all), war reparations (in the form of military assistance to NATO's eastern states, with particular attention to Poland), holding a referendum on the possession of arms, reducing the number of Members or introducing single-mandate electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation Mariusz Max Kolonko began to talk with Marek Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his profile in social media suggesting that #R would join forces with Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions happened eventually.
UBS: Golden close to the point of balance
"The euro will remain close to the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months, accompanied by a weak downturn in global markets," says Michael Bolliger, UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a solid growth rate and stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilising gold quotations on the current ceiling", says the specialist in the conversation with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite clear inflationary pressures, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks mitigate policies.
"While the gold is properly valued, the euro should remain in the vicinity of the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months, the Polish bonds are less attractive to him.
Michael Bolliger, Head of Asset Allocation to Emerging Markets with UBS Wealth Management, is much more profitable than Polish securities.
According to a specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world economy.
"Global slowdown may get worse, but there should not be a severe recession, and at the very least a downward trend of GDP slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.
"Investors should be underweight of global actions that could harm the lack of prospects for a solution to the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment and brixit procedure.
Among the share markets, Europe should behave relatively least", according to the latest letter to investors by the lead manager of UBS Wealth Management, Mark Haefele.
"The shares from the euro area should behave worse than the US, because they are more vulnerable under conditions of increased uncertainty about global trade and fear of slowdown," says the paper.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of German 10-year-olds up to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, the long-term viability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term, through the mitigation of bank monetary policy.
The Fed has the biggest area to lower its rates, which should lead to the weakening of the US currency in the next few years.
The long-term balance point for the euro quotations is the ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean a 19% potential for strengthening the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in the Fed's rates, which will lead to a decline in monetary policy in the world.
"The long-term strength of the dollar may not allow current and budgetary deficits," says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr is losing his weapon.
Confidential report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has reported the disappearance of 39 arms, 39 parts of weapons and 19 445 pieces of ammunition, based on a confidential inventory drawn up in the Ministry of Defence of RFN.
The press belonging to the Editorial Group EditorsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) reported.
According to a document from the Parliamentary Office of the State Secretary at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapons and 3,474 pieces of ammunition have been re-traced.
Among the military equipment still missing are six universal MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 barrels are missing for MG3 machine guns.
The vice-president of the left party, Martin Renner, expressed concern about the situation.
As she told RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “disturbing”.
Even more so, as a result of the investigation, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a "poor balance sheet".
She also criticised the fact that it does not show that there is also a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence that threatens the security of the state and of violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.
The officer was denied the preparation of attacks on leading German politicians with extreme right-wing and racist motives.
His "black list" of objectives, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegally into possession of four firearms, over 1,000 ammunition and over 50 explosives.
Crying kids on a plane.
How can we avoid them?
There's a solution.
The carrier Japan Airlines has recently used a function developed for those for whom travelling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the layout of the seats on the aircraft.
If a given combination travels under the age of two, then the "icon of the child" appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or carers.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the possibility to choose a place away from that occupied by the child.
The BBC states that the lines have already reported the failure of this solution.
"Children's icon" shall not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a change in the aircraft at the last minute.
As expected, the idea was shared by Internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, we used to be kids.
"We need to learn tolerance, because soon we will need maps of seats for breathtaking mouths, salivating or drunkards," wrote G Sundar.
Another Internet user noticed that he used to be disturbed by crying children on a plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also no shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me of screaming children on a 13-hour journey," said Rahat Ahmed.
Majorka expects losses from the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook travel agency
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive on vacation to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
On Friday, a representative of the Autonomous Government of the Balearic Islands Marc Pons reported, amongst 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take their October vacation in Majorca, there are also those who were to travel with companies indirectly related to Thomas Cook, e.g. the company Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of expected holidaymakers who, due to the bankruptcy of the British company, had to give up their vacation in Majorca next month were German citizens and Scandinavian countries.
However, as Ponts claims, since Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island in November-April, losses to the local economy will be lower.
He revealed that the Balearic government had already opened negotiations with international operators on the "entering the Majorca market" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
Diario de Mallorca estimates that in October, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs due to the tourism crisis in the Majorca.
About 800 are fired workers of Thomas Cook's office in Palmia.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with Thomas Cook's bankruptcy announcement in many hotels, Majorca property owners requested that guests pay an additional accommodation fee.
This situation has been experienced by several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had stopped their business until at least the end of October in connection with Thomas Cook's bankruptcy and the companies cooperating with it.
On the other hand, the Friday daily Diario de Ibiza indicates that most hotels operating in Ibiza, which cooperated with Thomas Cook, do not intend to close their facilities in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this ballerina island, British bankruptcy cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish Government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy announcement by Thomas Cook travel agency.
They revealed that the most affected tourists, about 36 000, were in Majorca.
According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is behind local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July to September 2019 of around EUR 5 million.
FIFA female ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, USA at the forefront
Polish women's representation takes 29th place in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Miłosz Stępiński was classified in the previous, July compilation.
Weak game of staff.
What's it gonna be in October?
The leaders were the other American women who recently won the title of World Champion.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, and the third place was held by the Dutch.
Polish people are preparing for ME qualifications.
They were supposed to start with a departure match with the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting it was postponed by one year because of food poisoning.
In this situation, the Polish authorities will launch a meeting with the Spanish on 12 November in Lublin.
Earlier, "White-Red" will play two social matches – on 3 October, on a trip with Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
The Polek rival group is represented by Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
Group winners and the top three teams from second places are promoted directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second positions will play in the marshes by the last three passes to the European Championships.
The rate of 16 participants will be supplemented by the host – England.
The men's representation of Poland in the September ranking of the FIFA fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Roz": Smog crushed the government
“The effects of the “Clean Air” programme are low, and the coal furnaces will kick this winter as if they never did,” says the first page of today’s “Rzeczpospolita”.
So far, 82 000 applications for funding totalling PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the Clean Air programme, of which 48 000 have been positive.
Accepted applications total more than 915 million PLN, says "Rz", referring to data from the Ombudsman.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred is reimbursed from the programme.
The results of the announced noise program are considered "moderate".
The self-government, quoted by the "Rz", is looking at the failures of the "Pure Air" in too much bureaucracy.
"The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by post, possible sampling of implementation.
This would improve the operation", thinks Mayor of Lidzbark Warmiński Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog alert that in the first year less than 1% of the intended goal of replacing 3 million hilling boilers was achieved.
According to "Rz", although the programme budget is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion annually, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, PLN 1.4 billion was reserved for this year," we read.
Congress agrees with F-35 for Poland
Blaszczak: Now negotiating prices
The US Congress approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft.
"This is one of the last steps before the contract, but it is not the end of our work," wrote Mariusz Blaszczak on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the most favourable price", added the Polish minister.
Contract for Polish F-35
Polish air forces are intended to supply 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, Poland agreed to their sale by the US Department.
The Communication underlines that investment will support national security and US foreign policy by improving the security of NATO's ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland has to pay $6.5 billion for fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract would also cover the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, the execution of engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of support for logistics and programme and staff training.
Lockheed Fighter Martin F-35
F-35 Lightning II fighter produced by Lockheed Martin is a single-seat and single-engined fifth-generation multi-tasking fighter.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out a mission of close support, bombing and typically fighter air combat.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
Recently, the F-35s bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16 with them.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also to consider buying U.S. aircraft.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer Barbie placed on the market a series of sexually neutral dolls.
That's how he wants to fight the stereotypes.
The manufacturer Barbie placed on the market a series of sexually neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin colors, figures or hairstyles, Mattel introduced a sex-neutral doll.
Toys from the Creatable World series wear wigs.
So children can decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In an instant, dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
It was also abandoned to highlight the characteristic sexual features – gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelashes and thin waists or, in the case of Ken, broad arms.
The company believes that children don't like their dolls to have sex standards imposed, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made for a particular sex inhibit girls' ambition and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"New dolls will allow all children to feel free," Mattel predicts.
Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a bathing suit and high-shoe shoes, has in the past been repeatedly criticised for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as an unnatural body proportion.
The company has responded to criticism and has already put on the market dolls with different skin colors and more rounded shapes.
There are also dolls in hijaba.
Zandberg: Round or Club Together can have a dozen MPs
Zandberg asked on the ZET radio, how many ZET candidates can get to the Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the candidates for the Sejm SLD, Spring and Left are starting together with the common logo "Levica"), replied that this depends on the outcome of the committee.
"I believe that the Left result will be very good, because we feel that people have the hope that the Left is not only right, but also strong," he pointed out.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60–80 Members.
“This may mean that a circle or club together will have a dozen Members.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I'm not going to guess and tell you how it's going to happen," he said.
Asked whether the Left would have a separate wheel together, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed to be diverse, and we will not pretend that there is no such diversity.
I think that this diversity has been rewarded by the Poles because we have shown that we have been able to agree on a common agenda when we differ."
Asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is SLD Włodzimierz Czarzaty, Zandberg replied that in his view the largest beneficiaries are the central left and left-wing voters.
On the other hand, as the SLD will receive the whole subsidy, he replied that "the aim of the political party is to represent its voters".
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the Sejm elections.
In the case of the Senate elections, he pointed out that he was wondering.
"The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also ones to which my heart is further," he said.
"On the other hand, I will be very honest and very clear that if I were in the 44th Senate District, I would take the election certificate and vote in another district," he stressed.
"I think I would not like to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (KO- PAP candidate)" he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leader of the Polish Nationals Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS start.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in D.C. on Friday to inaugurate a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims came by bus, by car, and by foot to Bopp district, where a new mosque was built, which could accommodate 30,000 believers.
The building was built by the Mouride fraternity, belonging to the Sufi Islamic mainstream, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares, which was passed on by the government.
The name of the mosque Massalikul Jinan ("Roads to Paradise") comes from the title of Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, worshiped as a saint.
The Mosque is surrounded by Carrar marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The Mosque in the middle will accommodate 15,000 believers, and the second will be on the outer Esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gold dome, giant chandeliers and handmade decorations by the workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but there is no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 believers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed from private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, provided lighting, sanitary facilities and funded road works worth EUR 10.5 million.
Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, it is us ourselves
The pass of eight league matches without winning the Korona players will try to stop in the Friday meeting with the vice-president of the Silesian extraclass.
"Our problem is not wroclawing, but we ourselves, we must work on what we play," stressed coach Mirosław Smyła.
The last Korona players and so far the only victory in the league were recorded in the first round when they defeated 1-0 beniamek of the Raków Częstochowa game on the way out.
Later, the Kielczans recorded two draw and six failures, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to the Lubin Cup in 1/32 of the Polish Cup final.
"I am very optimistic that in the last seconds the football team fought for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the wall after the last whistle did not result from a breakdown, only it was a fall of anger because they were so close," said Smyła.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, therefore it will sensitize the team to play in the lateral sectors of the field.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play,” added the coach.
In the Friday match in the Crown, there will certainly be no interruption for the excess of the yellow pages of Ognjen Gnjatic, and also the injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski will not be in the picture.
In contrast, it is upbuilding to join several players in the championship match with the will of the game.
"We have a headache, it seemed recently that he will not be, and now he is," said Smyła.
The Crown Defender Daniel Strangel stressed that Silesia would not be an easy rival to break the pass of eight league matches in a row without victory, while in an extraclass everyone can win with everyone.
"We are a good team.
In recent weeks we may not be showing this on the field, but this moment will come that we will win and we believe that it will be already on Friday", said the footballer.
After nine rounds of the Crown extract with a five-point score, it takes 15.
Silesia collected 12 more and placed second.
The Friday match in Kielce will start at 8.30 p.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
"42% of European tree species are at risk", warns the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUCN) in its "Red Paper of European Trees" published on Friday.
The list is headed by chestnuts and berry.
IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It has been drawn up by experts who have come to the conclusion that 42% of the 454 species of trees found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) are "highly endangered".
Among the causes of the Red Paper is the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most vulnerable are these trees and bushes, which occur only or mainly on our continent.
As far as typically European wood stand is concerned, 58% of species are at risk from IUCN experts and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and bushes, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper mentions errors in the exploitation of wood-castan, accelerated urbanisation, too intensive logging of trees, and subsequently forest fires and changes in Europe's ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, there is also a strong threat to the existence of many European varieties of bushes, mosses and vegetation.
"The follow-up of human activity leads to a gradual loss of European plant species and poses a danger in Europe of extinction of important and underestimated varieties that underpin European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," said Luc Bas, head of the IUCN European Office.
Grzegorz Schethina: I will not promise 600+
"Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles, offering them for freedom of distribution on a loan that will have to pay off future generations," says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for "Rzeczpospolita".
In his opinion, "the whole policy of PiS is pic".
At the same time, politicians promise that "what is given will not be taken".
Schethyna assures Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to overcome the Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the polls.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this regard than the Kaczyński party.
"Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal country are more than PiS supporters, a party that has betrayed the declared values, such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Schethina.
The leader of the Civil Coalition and president of the Civil Platform also stressed the basic foundations of the election programme KO.
"First of all, nothing that is given will be taken away, but we need to set a course for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen after dramaticly low investments," he said.
Secondly, it is about "launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work fairly - and those who are entrepreneurs".
Schetina explains that in the KO program there is a project, which will give the least earning Poles more about 614 zlotys on the hand and more earners – also for several hundred.
The politician also pointed out that he did not want to race for distribution.
As he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers auctioned with the opposition to the distribution, until the financial collapse of the country finally occurred," he stressed.
In an interview for "Rz", Schethyna also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki were afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"He is proud to fall.
Kaczyński is a man of the state like Banas is crystal," he added.
The PO also said that it had not yet decided whether to apply for the leadership of the Platform.
Argentina: Six dead big condors
In the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina, six large dead condors were found – says TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Large condoms are likely poisoned with a means to kill predators such as pumas, foxes, and wild dogs.
Animals could've eaten toxic paddlings.
In addition to one young person, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
"It is a great loss to the environment because the condor must reach 10-15 years in order to become fertile and reproductive.
So we are losing the protected species, the endangered species", says Luis Jacome, Director of the BioAndina Foundation, Argentina's environmental organization.
"I think that using toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
"Rz": They want the President's jewel
Work has started on the awarding of the head of the precious chain to the state.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda’s firm – we read in “Rzeczpospolita”.
As the newspaper explains, it is the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignium officially known during the interwar period of the Republic of Poland.
The last time he was used was probably President Ignacy Mostecki.
"Roz" says that soon such a chain can hit Andrew Duda's shoulders.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday for the amendment of the Law on Orders and Awards to restore it.
The journal says that this is also not the first attempt to restore this state head chain.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.
This time the work is swift.
At the beginning of August, the senators dedicated a few minutes, considering that they would consult the President's Office.
This one came in mid-September.
"I kindly inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position put forward in this petition", said President Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee continued to devote little time to the case.
"The President's office has given us a brief answer: it's for bringing it back," said the head of the committee Robert Mamátov from PiS, quoted by "Rz".
He submitted a proposal for legislative work, which was supported by the committee.
The police will teach the drivers how to drive through the crossroads
The police action will be carried out at the intersection of Ceplinski Al. Piłsudskiego.
Uniform action is linked, in some ways, to recent complaints by the city authorities against drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the crossroads.
On Friday, September 27th, the police are starting their preventive activities in Rzeszów "Round crossings".
It is about eliminating traffic difficulties: crossing the road without the possibility of exit, not complying with traffic lights or road signs.
"We often think we're alone at the crossroads, and we're actually making life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobiński, vice president of the city a few days ago.
His words spoke at the city hall press conference, at which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate traffic of cars at the intersections, resulting in traffic jams.
Then the president appealed to the travellers for reason on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not texting while driving.
The theme was, as it were, taken over by the Roman police, who are starting today with the action "Table Crossroads".
What is it?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of congestion limitation at the intersections by drivers entering without continuing driving.
This is a frequent misdemeanor, which contributes to enhancing congestion in traffic and creating traffic jams.
It is threatened by a mandate of PLN 300 and 2 criminal points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic lights or road signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe a lack of fluidity, late movement from the tell-tales, free crossings and leaving too much distance between the vehicles.
What crossroads will be the subject of action?
M.a. on Lisa-Kuli street from Jagiellonianska street; al. Ciepliński from Piłsudskiego street; ul. Targowa from Piłsudskiego street; Plac Śreniawitów from Dąbrowskiego street; and ul. Hetmanska street from Warsaw's insurgents.
Such actions in the Podkarpacie capital will be carried out on the next Friday of October.
They checked the waste disposal company from "Czaczka"
"The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Old Town of Wołomiński and the District Inspection of Construction Supervision checked on Friday the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the "Czajka" sewage treatment plant in Warsaw was disposed of," said Mr.
Inspectors from the Volomińskie Care have carried out checks at a plant in the forests of the village of Zielonka.
The "Dar-Trans" Private Trade and Transport Plant, by means of a contract with the capital waste treatment plant "Czajka", operates water waste management services.
"The installation was examined and the company was also asked to provide documentation related to its activities," said Szysko.
He added that the audit report would be submitted, among others, to the Regional Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last inspection in "Dar-Transie" was carried out by the Regional Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw between 29 December 2015 and 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not carry out samples, measurements and tests of groundwater, nor did it have results from studies of stabilised municipal sewage sludges from the "Czaka" sewage treatment plant.
Following the review of the KIC Dariusz, he was invited to cease the infringement of the terms of the decision.
The DAR-TRANS Private Trade and Transport Plant Dariusz Saturday is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilised municipal sewage sludges from the „Czaka“ treatment plant.
According to the decision to dispose of waste in the production site, waste weighing up to 60,000 tonnes per year is processed in forests near Zielonka.
Last Thursday, the Warsaw Municipal Waterworks and Canalisation Company informed that STUOŚ was shut down at the turn of November and December 2018, which was related to damage to one of the combustion plants.
According to MPWK, the monthly cost of their exports is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Margaret Kidawa-Błońska.
"You have taken up a difficult task, you can count on my complete support," said Lech Wałęsa to Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska on Friday.
"Mr President, these are very important words to me", replied the candidate for the Civil Coalition, the leader of the list of KOs in Warsaw.
The former President stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, this is now "only a fan of retirement".
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met on Friday with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk.
The son of Wałęsa – Jarosław also took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
"You have taken up a difficult task," said Lech Wałęsa after the meeting.
"You can count on my complete support," he added.
“The problems before Poland are known to us all.
Therefore, the great hope that you, as a woman, can handle these problems, and we all - those who love Poland - will support your actions as much as possible", said the former President, addressing Kidawa-Błońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for her support.
"Mr President, these are very important words to me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the Constitution, and knows how important this is," she said.
“Let us show that we can make a different, wise policy together, but according to the Constitution, according to law, according to respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and we want to change Poland," said Kidawa-Błońska.
Retirement support
He spoke to journalists and said that he is now "only a fan of retirement".
"Of course, I'm looking at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, checked, (to this) we will return.
The distribution of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And all of this has to be cleaned, all of this has to be restored to normal, and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if we don't, we have a street criterion," said Lech Wałęsa.
"That is why it is so important that the Poles go to the elections, consider and make their own decisions.
And this is the most important thing," said Kidawa-Błońska.
"The last chance we have of improving the state of things in Poland with a card" replied the former President.
"We must build a new foundation"
She asked about the most important changes that should be made in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “The President has said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since there is no division of power, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and so that everyone knows that Poland will not move forward."
ME volleyball: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-final.
On a hot ground in Ljubljana, Polish volleyballs fought with the Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European championship.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with the judges, with the Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
The "White Reds" have lost 1:3 and will play for a brown medal.
The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate adopted, without amendments, the law on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important persons in the State.
52 senators voted without amendments, 14 voted against, and three abstained.
The senators therefore decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during the Wednesday debate by Senator Sławomir Rybnicki.
According to him, the amendments were intended to "civilise" the law and to limit the scope of the information provided in the statement on the property situation of own children, the children of the spouse, children adapted to cases where children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make a statement.
The act on the transparency of the property of the families of the most important state officials, the project of which was established at the Prime Minister's office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.
The rules provide that, inter alia, the Prime Minister, ministers, Members, MEPs, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as the persons at the forefront of other state institutions, will be obliged to include in the property statement information on the personal property of the spouses, children and persons in common.
Nor did the Senate propose amendments to the Act on Flights of Key Persons in the State.
It regulates what flights are in HEAD status and who may be on board government aircraft with the most important persons in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for keeping the Central Register of Flights.
55 senators voted in favour of the bill without amendments, 12 opposed and four abstained.
According to the Act, each flight of the President will be a "official flight".
The President's flights will be accompanied by family members and others invited by the President.
On the other hand, only a flight "to carry out tasks directly related to the function" will be flying on the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Sejm and Senate Marshals.
The Act also specifies the list of persons who may be accompanied by the most important persons in the country during the flight.
According to the rules on board the aircraft may include members of the delegation - invited Members, senators, representatives of the public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational services; and journalists.
In accordance with the Act, in the event of any doubt concerning the flights of the Sejm and Senate Marshals, the Head of the KPRM will request clarification.
If such doubts are not clarified within the time limit set, the Head of the KPRM shall be required to notify the Head of the Sejm or the Senate of the inability to organise such a flight.

After the first training in Paris, Poles are waiting for the last rival
On Friday, the Polish volleyball team held their first training in Paris, where they will perform at the brown medal on Saturday.
The custody of Vitala Heynen closed down the Thursday defeat with the Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud of them to get in trouble with the game.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday afternoon they went together with the Slovenians charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had training in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the reports of the participants, the world champion trainer was nervous.
As the assistant of Heynena Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just the exercise of volleyball elements.
“We went to the hall, but in the vast majority it was time for the band.
It was about spending more time together than training.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild all of this as a team," he reported.
He confirmed that semi-final failure was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
"We have been brutally brought to the ground.
No doubt we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd be back in this game.
We discussed this game with each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot to the players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would point out inefficiencies in the attack and much worse than usual coping with the situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect," he analyzed.
In his opinion, the "White-Red" did not stand up to the stress associated with the performance against the public supported by the loud and numerous co-hosts of the tournament.
He admitted that the world’s champions might have put a smooth road to the semi-finals.
"Maybe if we had a similar-style failure in the group phase, we would have looked at this lesson sooner and later we would have played in the next phase of the tournament.
But it's just a fucking thing," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with the Thursday defeat of the Poles will be able to overcome the aggression in the bronze game.
"I hope that we will show our true face then.
There's something to fight about.
We recently won the ME medal in 2011" he reminded.
Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country visited by the Poles during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group they went to Apeldoorn, and for the semifinal they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment but suspended
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week launch ban and a $25,000 fine – in a six-month suspension – for words, gestures and acts during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour is losing patience with Kyrgyzus, but they are still giving him a chance to improve.
The summaries of the most uninterrupted professional tennis player in recent years look dangerous – 16 weeks of breaks plus a lot of fines, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a trial period in which a picky athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he's been working hard for a long time and he's made a specific tennis record in the world – he had to pay the highest in history of discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of conduct on and beside the court.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsional behavior, insulting judges and viewers, breaking two rockets during a losing match with Karen Chaczanov – all of this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $113 thousand.
He did not play long in the US Open 2019 either, but he made it public that ATP activists “are corrupt,” which hurt the organization so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgeos and, after a few weeks, gave the verdict about suspension of the start and the next fine.
However, words of corruption were forgiven, after hearing the accused and learning the context of the statement.
In the justification, however, the tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that the behaviour of Kyrgios over the past 12 months has in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted almost a continuous violation of the rules that it has constantly offended people associated with tournaments and viewers, hence a high penalty.
ATP, however, gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the judgment, ordering several conditions to be fulfilled in the next six months: in ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios, it can no longer in any way violate the rules of the code of conduct of the professional tennis players, in particular, it can no longer curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and the public, nor any other way to behave indecently and vulgarly.
He also received a recommendation to seek “continuous support” from mental trainers during the tournaments and also outside the season to consult with people specialising in solving the problems of athletes who do not manage to behave properly.
The first commentary (on social media) of Nick Kyrgios on the verdict was: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break, as Lavera’s shoulder injury worsened, so he had to give up the nearest start in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
The ATP Kyrgios ranking takes 27th place.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than 1.3 million dollars, so even after fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: Poland is getting better
The report on household budgets published by the GUS on Friday shows that as a good or rather good material situation 44% of them assessed their situation.
The previous year was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5%, and earlier since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessment of the situation of households, it never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% a year before and over 20% in 2009.
The best material situation for self-employed households is the situation.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
At the second pole there are households rencists, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the physical situation of households.
The worst is for single parents, of whom 32% declare good or rather good material situation.
The percentage of couples with children varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60%, with 48.8% of childless households.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500+ programme.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst material situation was assessed by single parents and multi-child families (with at least three children).
The improvement of subjective assessments of the situation of Poles reflects the rapid growth of income, mainly from work.
However, that is not all, because the share of households that consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of the voivodship there is no clear link between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best ratings are formulated by residents of the Opole region, where 48.9% of the surveyed consider their situation to be good or rather good.
The Lubuskie voivodeships (47.7%), Śląskie (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie voivodships (47.1%) are still present.
In Opole, however, the distributional income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average and 98% in Lubusek.
The highest income was for Mazowiecki people (120% of the national average) and for Silesian people (104%).
On average in Poland, income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after the price adjustment), it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Against the background of previous years, this is quite low.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.
Although income growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These per person amounted to PLN 1187, which means that they decreased by 0.7% in real terms.
This is the first case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Household budget surveys suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its disposable income, while in 2014 this share was still above 80%, and by 2006 it was above 90%.

USA: Three suicides among carrier crew
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush last week – reported the U.S. Navy.
In the last two years, five crew members have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July this year and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each incident occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush moored off the coast of Virginia.
The participation of third parties has so far been excluded.
In addition, death is not meant to be related.
“The need for everyone to be involved in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to point out that there is no stigmatisation or other repercussions regarding the search for help," wrote Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander on Facebook.
Nesiołowski critically about the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In his conversation with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiałowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.
"In fact, every opinion of him was accepted."
Later, some of his actions were criticised.
“For me, John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of Ryzidek, he lays a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – the pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best of Pope Polak's life," he explained.
The former PO politician admitted: “There were glooms of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, he did not accept Rydzik once, but he had power, and he could simply throw him out of the Church for politics or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do it, like his successors," explained Niesiołowski.
"In addition, this terrible matter of pedophilia and the operation of the Church has come to light, or rather, of their absence.
I ran off thinking a little bit, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole shape of his life.
The pedophilia scale in the Church has been relatively recent.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things", he says in a conversation with the journalist Niesiółowski.
In the evaluation of the former Polish politics, the Church is an ally of PiS.
"It is necessary to admit that during the period of Solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, the crosses hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are spelling, they have become a symbol of the dictatorship – the sign of the Pisan regime.
I repeat: One of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that such people as Rydzyk shake the Polish Church that John Paul II has done nothing about it and that the Church is today an ally of PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will be asked to pay without fail," Niesiółowski argued.
"I hope Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Ryzyk and a few others of this kind," he summed up.
FLOWERS: Tomorrow 590th anniversary of the county
There'll be a gala of concerts and auctions.
The Jubilee gala will be held in the Hrubieszów House of Culture.
First, the Holy Mass will begin at 10 a.m. in the church of St. Nicholas.
The official opening of the ceremony will take place at 11.30 in HDK.
The band of songs and dances of the Hrubieszowska Land will perform.
The young people from the ILO by Stanisław Staszica will present a performance entitled: "The district of Grubieszowski: From here my family – here I live".
The medals will then be presented "Deserved for the brute district".
At 16 o'clock, the event will move to the city walk, where the concerts "Hrubieszów charityly for Angelika Zińkiewicz" will be held.
They will play the disco pol bands – NoLimit, Malibu, Energy Girls and the star of the evening Mig.
There will be auctions, including feathers and porcelain of the Prime Minister.
PZPN is punishing bullies in stadiums.
Disqualified griffin
The fight between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk for a small hair did not end tragically when the goalkeeper Zlatana Alomerovica, who was fired by fans from Wejherowa, passed the race for millimeter.
After this incident, the game was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN commission investigating this case has given Gryf severe punishment, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, the fans will not be allowed in the nearest match at their own stadium.
Nor will they be able to leave for league games until 31 December.
Burdy also called fans of Silesian Wrocław at Widzewa Łódź Stadium.
Here, however, the PZPN judgment was milder, because Silesia had warned that similar events could occur and had sensitized the relevant authorities on this issue.
Nevertheless, the services have allowed the sector of the Łódź fans to be tossed, set fire to chairs and fortified by the host sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-off stadium ban in the nearest match in the Polish Cup and prohibited the organisation of trips to the matches in this and the next edition of PP.
The Extraklas league matches were also banned, but it will last until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange markings across the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Reichs
In Podkarpacie, implementation of the amendment of the Regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among other things, the registration of the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish.
For example, "Lions" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our voivodship, changes will be made to 94 road signs on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines stem from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that the names of towns in neighbouring countries often also have Polish sounds.
Thanks to the change we have prepared, they will finally appear on the roadside on our roads.
The introduction of a new marking starts with the section of the A4 motorway in Podkarpacka," said the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpacie, the changes will be made to 94 road signs set on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total cost of the investment?
200,000 PLN.
First of all, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.
What's it supposed to look like to implement the idea?
It'll be out of the exchange board, on a stick-up basis.
They will replace the current name of the village with the new ones written in Polish on already existing characters.
Both names will be written in one row – first in Polish and then in the original, in brackets.
This will make it much easier for people who do not know the spelling of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swans out of a windmill
In the pond in Zameczna in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants noticed a swan having trouble with its wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had set themselves an animal target – a shot was found in his body from the windmill.
"The early bird received information from the villagers of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Centre in New Salt.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to the scene.
It was immediately obvious that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and accurately to avoid harming him and putting additional stress on the table.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first photo of the X-ray, it was already known that someone had turned it into a gunnery shield.
In his body there were shrapnels of bullet", says Marcin Walasek, CEO of Malpol managing, among others, the rehabilitation centre.
Winters in the resort
"The wounds have been cleaned, the bird has been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the resort where he will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He's not able to fly yet.
Releaseing him now would be associated with the fact that he would probably not survive the winter," adds Walasek.
After the swan's rehabilitation, the staff intends to release him in the spring to the same pond.
The authorities of the municipality of Żukowice, after receiving information on the cause of the animal’s poor health condition, intend to inform the prosecutor’s office of the case.
The event occurred in Zameczno
Gowin: "We must stimulate Polish, small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, it will have to be considered whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement.
Gowin said during the "Day Signals" call in Radio Single that trade is controlled by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that, in fact, Polish companies cannot grow.
It is very difficult to deal with this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the government of PiS tried to face this at the very beginning of its term of office, but was given a "controversy by the EC".
"We have won before the Court of Justice, and I hope that if the United Right wins the nearest elections and formulates the government, we will return to that topic," he said.
He also pointed out that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, i.e. small trade".
"To this end, it will be necessary to consider whether the government has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Gowin.
In May, the EU Court held that the European Commission had made a mistake considering that the Polish retail tax was illegal public aid.
The retail sales tax Act assumed the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% from income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% from income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC opened proceedings for infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered as public aid.
It then concluded that the tax was implemented in an illegal manner.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until its analysis has been completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but it did not finish the case.
On 24 July, the Commission brought an appeal before the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press services of the TEU reported to PAP that the case is at a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether or when the oral procedure, the hearing of the parties and the possible hearing, will begin.
The need for good few to several months after the appeal has been filed.
"This conduct lasts for an average year", said PAP's source in the Luxembourg Court of First Instance.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We're making a few practical solutions.
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.
It is often the first occasion around the child where the whole family is centered together to celebrate his appearance in the world.
No wonder a freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look the best on that day.
However, before you make a final decision about the child’s outfit, consider whether he will also be comfortable.
In shops you can find many dress-up sets that do not provide the little one with proper comfort.
What, then, should be noted?
The basic criterion for choosing a woman to be baptized is the age of a child
Until recently, several weeks old children were baptized, dressed in white sets, and put in the same barrels or large cushions.
Today, children who join the sacrament are often older: several months, a year or even more.
It is not difficult to imagine that such a great comfort needs a slightly different dress for baptism.
So if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will likely spend the celebration in a wheelchair or on the hands of his parents or the godfathers.
The best option is to dress it up in comfortable cotton sleepers or sets.
Although this piece of clothing is considered a daily outfit, it is sufficient to look for its sacred variants, for example with a wave or lace.
For the boy it will be perfect for points with a print of flies and shells.
In the case of older children, a bigger fantasy can be afforded in clothing.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tiula dress
Many parents of girls with a yearning look towards richly decorated, phalanous dresses for baptism, complete with coats, belts and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-respiratory materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In order to find the right outfit, it will be better to check out the store Asanti for Kids, which offers elegant costumes on cotton linings.
Gentle, tiule skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and charming sets will make your little girl look beautiful and comfortable.
Perfect outfit for a small gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, the boys had a fashion for suits that were a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and pants, rigid collars or casseroles often made young elegants loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they were thrown away by comfortable cotton sets.
Just take a look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, which is soft, shirt shorts, and a blouse decorated in front of the vest.
These machines look very sacred, and at the same time they do not interfere with the movements that come to know the world of the little one.
Krystyna Pavłowicz published a statement of property
Krystyna Pavłowicz made a property statement at the end of the term of office.
It shows that the MEP of PiS collected PLN 110,000 in savings.
Let us remind you that Pavlovich has announced an exit from politics.
By the end of the term of office, it has an amount of PLN 110 thousand.
According to a statement made by a Member, it receives a monthly pension of PLN 4.7 thousand.
Pawłowicz has an apartment worth PLN 570 thousand and slightly smaller, which he rents, taking PLN 880 a month.
The messenger also invests in industrial metals, assessing the investment for PLN 150 thousand.
Prior to that, Jarosław Kaczyński also published the property statement.
Voting on the intermission of the Conservative Party conference
The British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the meetings of the House of Communes during the annual programme conference of the Conservative Party, as requested by the government.
289 MEPs voted against – 306.
Ordinarily, the House of Communes shall not be held during party conferences so that Members do not have to give up their participation or from Parliament's meetings.
However, opposition parties considered that, at the time of the last weeks ahead of the UK's planned departure from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the meeting.
The government's request for a break was supported by 289 Members, and it was against 306.
Two opposition parties after the Conventions
Failure to agree to a break may be taken as a political revenge against Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (the decision was declared illegal by the Supreme Court on Tuesday) and for not wanting to apologize for the decision of the judges.
Following that decision, the House of Communes resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the following turbulent debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking the brixit and avoiding early elections.
"The time has come to realize the brixit.
It must be realized in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Rexit needs to come so that we can deal with the citizens' priorities, the health services, the cost of living.
Rexit must be implemented so that we can unite this country," said Johnson.
The Conservative Party conference is due to begin in Manchester next Sunday and will last until Wednesday, 2 October.
The two main groups of the opposition – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already been held.
One of the reasons Johnson provided for this long suspension of parliament was the party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders", writes foreign media.
The President's spokesman has strongly detested these reports.
"It's just not true," he said on Twitter.
Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", refer to "Jewish Insider", writes that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Polish Consulate in New York, stated that Israel was responsible for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to Israel's foreign minister, Katz, who stated in February that "the Poles sucked out anti-Semitism with mother's milk".
Andrzej Duda said that he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned an act of aggression against the Polish ambassador in Israel Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an assailant who shouted, "Polak, Polak."
"The quote is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true," he said on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
According to Spichalski, the "invented it" portal.
According to the "JI" spokespersons, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivors, the decorated Order Order of the Polish Order of Merit Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda's words and to say that the Jews from Israel "like Israel Kac" were responsible for the growth of anti-Semitism.
According to Boteach's sources, he was about to break Mosberg's speech.
Who is Banas and what did he do?
The tenement house rented by the Witnesses led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banasia's property statements.
We will summarize another affair that has shaken the government camp.
TVN's "Superviser" journalists revealed that Marian Banas, President of the Supreme Audit Chamber, has not inscribed a 400-metre building in the property statement in the last few years, which is located on the Krakow Podgóry.
Moreover, his tenant was supposed to drive in the above-mentioned sex business house (so renting rooms for hours).
On the other hand, the building itself was supposed to have been collateral for the repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel pointed to the irregularity in the Superviser program.
A journalist revealed that from Banasius, people associated with the criminal world rented the building to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
The clients were to be men using prostitutes.
Banas's accusations were vague and confusing.
Interestingly, the tenement house rented by the Witnesses led a journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.
For the tenement itself was described in them unclearly, and the income from its lease was to be lower.
"The property of Marian Banasia and his wife can be worth between 6 and 8 million PLN.
In total, the spouses can boast of two homes, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia building itself was worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-corruption Office is currently in control of Marian Banasia's property statements for the period 2015-2019.
Banas announced that he would suspend his activities in NIK until it was completed. "I will call on the Marshal for a free vacation," he said.
The opposition demands an explanation.
"We do not hear the CBA expanding its investigation or speeding up the investigation of Marian Banasia's property statements.
That is why we are forced to guarantee state authorities and to make a notification of the possibility of committing a crime [...]", said Mr Po-KO Mariusz Witczak.
"If the normal Pole had so extremely low valued the rental of its properties, he would have already had 10 controls, a tax credit and a group-tax procedure," he added.
He went high, fell low
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Control Board.
He was appointed on 30 August 2019 for a six-year term of office.
His candidacy was tabled by the Law and Justice and by the politicians of that party.
Before that, Banas was associated with NIK between 1992 and 2005, he worked as a co-worker of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first governments of PiS (2005-2008), Banas held the position of Customs President and the Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has been re-emerged on the Customs Service Chief's table and has been managing the National Tax Administration since 2017.
Banas served as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki for three months.

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoreing a police officer will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding a certain order of conduct issued by a police officer is to be a new kind of offense, threatened by a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.
The police union wants to make a change like this.
The idea went to the Committee on Petitions.
"The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million criminal cases are brought to Polish courts," we read.
The "Rzeczpospolita" has determined that the petition that the Independent Trade Union of Police has written to Members on the revision of the Code of Offence has a chance of success.
The petitioners shall propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offence.
It would read, "Whoever is not subject to a request or order from a public officer, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, is subject to arrest, fines or restrictions of liberty."
“Paragraph 3 of this provision refers to the same punishment for those who do not execute orders, do not make it impossible or difficult to carry out their duties,” states the journal.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolita", that although he agrees with the main message of the recipe proposal, he fears that if implemented, it can be used in political manifestations.
"In situations of freedom, it would be unfavorable, and instead of mitigating the situation, it would even exacerbate it," he adds.
The statistics provided by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens have been positive about police interventions in 2018 and that they take 1.5 million city interventions each month.
Buras is worried about Europe
Topol's jachym has writing in his blood.
His ancestors include editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war playwrights of the Czech Republic, today mentioned in one row with Václav Havel.
So Jáchym had been hanging from the beginning the curse of talent that he was trying to exploit.
After eight years, he returned with "Sensible Man."
The heroes are Buras and Soňa along with two sons, but they do not form a typical Czech family.
They're wandering actors, they travel across Europe.
He is a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she is a one-eyed translator who does not part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound, and for the other, he stopped in infancy.
But it's not the heroes who are most important in this story.
Everyone is just the background to observe a world where there is no room for artistic nomads.
It's a world of stuffed provinces, a society of old, suspicious people, and unfailing young people.
"The Sensitive Man" turns places into an absurd theatre.
Narration imitates didascal, and the conversations of heroes create this world.
Europe is full of fear for its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has failed, his Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is in operation.
However, the company has problems.
As reported by VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that they would cancel 105 flights in October due to the bankruptcy problems of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All travels with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to get the money back.
The Ghent court also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian daughters' companies, Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently around 12 thousand Belgians are abroad on trips purchased at Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave with the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, spokesperson Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is now "fully operational" despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British mother company, which caused concern among employees and customers.
At that time, the office calmed down that the customers who bought him a trip would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – announced bankruptcy at night on Sunday on Monday.
The direct cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of the last chance on Sunday discussions with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors requested that, in addition to the 900 million pounds of rescue plan already agreed in August, the company would receive an additional 200 million as collateral for the winter period when travel agencies usually have a lower turnover.
However, the company’s problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer prepared for the German visitors Görlitz.
Action is intended to help fight the growing decline in the population of the city.
Görlitz is the eastmost city of Germany.
A beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, according to The Guardian, the city is facing considerable problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also faces a steady decline in the population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left to the west of the country, which translated into a 25% drop in the city's population.
In 2013, it amounted to 54 000 people.
To combat the depopulation, the officials came up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
In the meantime, 150 applications have been submitted to the programme.
Two thirds of them were made up by the inhabitants of big cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the program.
"When we applied, we thought the program would convince people to move to Görlitz", said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free homes, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the whole country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the views of programme participants.
The information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need and if they decide to move – what their motivation was", said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas of attracting new residents, offering them housing incentives.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy or in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.
