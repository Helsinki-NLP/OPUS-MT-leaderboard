Prague Stock Exchange has fallen to a negative at the end of trade
After the early fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected losses.
CEZ transactions have reached almost half of the day-to-day trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange has been following up on its Monday fall since the start of Tuesday’s trade, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, a drop in shares in Wall Street is behind the decline.
In our case, the market response to the result of the US House vote, which refused to support the plan for stabilising the financial sector.
The Fall of Stocks in Asia
Dramatic fall on Tuesdays experienced stock exchanges in Asia, although the indexes finally erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index in Hong Kong wrote off almost four percent in the course of trading, but later deleted some of the losses and decreased to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stock on the Hong Kong stock exchange, has dropped by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets have been closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The storm in Taiwan, according to the local index, dropped 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the rescue action in the US is uncertain and will affect the financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Hong Kong, although part of China, sets its own monetary policy, regardless of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates have Hong Kong at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should quickly return to the negotiations and the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it is said that other countries are likely to feel the impact.
The Blood Bath of American Stocks
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion CZK).
The legislators ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy as a whole.
American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the major stock indices experienced the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped by almost seven percent, and to a similar extent it was last seen in 1987.
The index had fallen before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal had not passed, the index was in a free fall.
The U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
The Supreme Representatives of the US Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance to the US financial system.
It will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
American legislators have made a breakthrough in the discussions on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
But it's not won yet.
Congressmen have to complete some of the details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final form of the law.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Reuters was told by the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank.
According to sources, the Senate could vote on the plan first on Wednesday.
According to economists, the notification of the approval of the rescue plan should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of the financial markets.
But then there will be "sobriety" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms that help the markets to achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We made great progress.
We have solved our different views on what the market stabilisation package is supposed to look like," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi for Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislators met with the US Treasury Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive form to the government fund.
This should buy out non-sale mortgage assets from financial companies that download financial companies into severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
There is still a need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
Asian trade signal
The global financial crisis is affecting stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada’s democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm investors down before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where Congress’s decision could affect Monday’s trade.
It is not yet clear, however, when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, or whether they can't get caught up in a problem at the last minute.
The legislators hope to be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still see a number of changes.
The total amount allocated to the aid scheme shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $ 350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not doing its job, followed by another $100 billion and later the ultimate $ 350 billion.
Bush appreciated progress in the negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may overrule its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to obtain funding for the redemption of bad mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, has been preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates the "bottom-up effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Senate’s Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the head of the negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed on the responsibility for the cash programme, protection of the taxpayers from losses, closure of the relief, timing of the financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the programme and set up a committee to supervise the fund.
It should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also includes help for homeowners who have trouble paying back.
The government should negotiate new instalments for the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of repayments to debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the chief economist Patri Finance David Mark, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And that's because they don't know what mechanism and at what cost problem assets are going to be bought out.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government share their losses," Marek said this week for the server iHNed.cz.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week, it's not that important, according to Mark.
"It is much more important that this week's congressmen agree that they support this plan and that it will be sacrificed as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on approval is at this moment the most important," Marek stressed.
Knife blade fight: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We can help you choose
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
From that, it seems clear that it's better to buy a phone.
Yet, there are enough reasons to buy a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which the future owner is used and the requirements.
You may find it hard to get a high-end, expensive turntable home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
However, such music products do not appear on LP boards and there is no qualitative reason for that.
However, if your shelves are guilty of art rock, jazz or blues, you are likely to dream of such a turntable.
It's the same with music on the road, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and qualitative categories.
It may be unacceptable for someone to spend 8,000 crowns per player, as well as a Pink Floyd fan, he may find it hard to get his headphones for 20 crowns from the marketplace.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines battery life
Some top music players can do much more than just play music, but what most cell phones can't do.
No current device is as universal as a phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephony and texting, she can play music and video, both of them recording, she has a better, worse camera, and maybe she can navigate.
And if you think about smartphones and communicators, you'll have a little computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill, and no TV's photographing anything.
The universality of the mobile phone brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile phone, the sooner the indicator will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eats.
Few phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, the music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more powerful.
For cheap phones, therefore, expect them not to play you for more than a few hours.
If you still have a phone call, get another charger to work for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the worse ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation for one charge.
The next problem is when recording music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can deal with miniature memory cards that are used in their phones without reduction.
You don't need any special software for players except for the exceptions (iPod).
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most of the mobile phones and players themselves will already create a music library sorted by the name of the artist, album name, genre or, for example, user rating.
Some devices display only the tree structure of directories similar to the explorer in Windows and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When selecting a particular device, you will be particularly interested in the strength of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of the control.
If the music is especially a backdrop and if you listen to it every day just for a short time in a tram, it is enough for you to have any phone that plays MP3.
Which can be done by almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch too much what music formats your phone or player can do.
MP3 can handle all and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread and besides it the vast majority of instruments can also handle music in the WMA format.
AAC (used by Apple and its iPods) is less present.
Better mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
Just visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) via the mobile Internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already be a strong argument in itself for the acquisition of a music cell.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is usually limited to high-speed radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this particular way of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will take control of the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their phones around all the time.
Whenever you get a desire to hear something, you can feel your phone in your pocket while the MP3 player is lying forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wire handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker, which has almost every cell phone, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music phones will be for many.
The cheapest is usually below 3,000.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of an output to normal headphones.
The best and technically most equipped phones with 3.5 mm plug for common headphones are up to 15 thousand.
The advantage of players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can control really everyone.
The minimum function, the similarity of the control with a previously normal taper or, for example, the turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of collisions in the form of accidentally switched on mobile internet and then a large account for data transmission.
After which device to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot on the exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the card, you will fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive can handle 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you better touch specialized mobile phones - walkmen (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungy).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is close to a separate MP3 player.
It is further in Sony Ericsson, whose walkman phones have the same user interface as the self-sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with more memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery capacity (up to 15 hours, up to 35 hours maximum), will take MP3 players away from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classics cheaper.
Maybe she won't be long.
We have written on Mobile.cz many times about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
In addition, the CTU also confirmed that the SMS price is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming charges regulation, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks competition that would really want to start a fight.
It may sound paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and a penetration of over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, are happy to say that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this he often also called for the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has expressed several times that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with his own network probably does not have much chance (after all, it would be difficult to find frequencies).
But there is one more option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought significant reductions in prices, to which classical operators had to respond.
At the same time, in the UK, there were voices like ours before Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market.
However, it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we do not have to go too far for examples.
In February this year we informed you about the start of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
At the same time, the financial group Penta is behind Mobilking, which owns, among other things, U:phone in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move as well as a bet on an unburdened target group.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"Administrative men elect a mobile operator that they like and trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could be found in Poland as well.
Vodafon's press agent Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of services."
In the Czech Republic no chance, they call mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobileking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, negotiations do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, the press spokesperson of the financial group Penta in a telephone interview.
It has indirectly confirmed that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not in favour of this idea.
Rather, on the contrary, they are trying to do everything in their power not to create any potential competitors.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been secreted for a long time by the GTS Novera group, which would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of O2 Telephony in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in offering not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner the better.
We discussed this possibility repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to advance with some of them in the negotiations," says the spokesperson of the Group, Pavel Kaidl.
Well, maybe it's for a better time.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be looking forward to perhaps by the end of the year.
For the time being, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is a space on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a comprehensive and serious project in this field," said Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of the Telephonics O2.
Other operators also appeal to the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in rare harmony with O2: "For the time being, we have not recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build further."
And he adds: "It's hard for some virtual operator to show up on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a specific agreement on the table to be considered in this short term."
Vodafone holds its attention to meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says, "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider the most profitable in terms of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile Internet."
Responsible offices - with operators one hand
Mobile operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would increase competition, lead to a drop in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, make it easier for such a competitor to enter?
The fact that when it comes to doing something, they can pull a rope, even the U:phone pulls.
Probably the biggest pressure towards the CTU went at the time of the creation of U:phone by T-Mobile.
This is testified to public information from the CTU website.
But now the U:phone fits as an argument as to why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would impose high demands on him and, above all, on his services."
In view of this approach of mobile operators, however, it is a direct concern of the Czech regulatory authorities.
This is not just about the position of the CTU, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other advanced countries - does not have the power to intervene in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical stand on the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential candidates was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," said Kristian Chalupa of the Department of External Relations.
The representatives of the operators do not seem to be surprised at the expression thus formulated.
It is more than a serious one from an office to represent consumers' interests and, inter alia, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their entry into the market contributed to lower prices for mobile services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the drop in prices are clearly not among the interests of the OHS.
In fact, it is shocking for the entire case to have the impression of three mobile operators reacting.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is offered all by itself.
As well as the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations, it is certainly only a work of chance and a tough competition.
"The Office has not found signs of anti-competitive action in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, so it is not adequately responsible for its conduct on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to be missing the telecommunications regulator," he said.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of dispute.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by the CTU, according to which telecommunications is a single market from a competitive point of view.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - you always need the consent of the network operator to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator - he has quite logically - on his network monopoly.
So in a particular segment, it has to be dominant.
However, even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning for the UOHS that the three mobile operators are doing the same.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles in dealing with all operators.
The delegation of responsibility for the CTU is a fairly common trick in telecoms, which gives the UOHS hands away from the whole matter.
We've met him in a few similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act with the extension of the competence of the CTU to competition in telecommunications, it was not possible to enforce, although many experts promised to improve the situation.
This must be known by the representatives of the UOHS more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It works when no one's watching
At the same time, the operation of some pseudovirtual operators, which there are several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies issuing their own mobile phone service prices, but they are only partially public.
It is usually a company dealing with multilevel marketing.
It has its own mobile phone service, such as Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these companies usually only get to the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company acts as a classic corporate customer vis-à-vis the operator, ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer then gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators are prohibited.
"If there are cases you are talking about, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," she replied to our question on this issue by Martina Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that a similar activity to those of responsible mobile operators could not be brought forward.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, it may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are opposed to such a procedure.
The activities of these companies have negligible profits and, unlike the real virtual operators, do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, but the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
Moreover, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not kept in their name, so they cannot have it fully as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that's what should be weird at least.
In addition, another question for the UNHS is being opened.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a similar procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to say that the UOHS has a relatively strong authority to reveal a similar activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the operator’s explanation that they have no idea about it and their business conditions prohibit it.
When We Will Not Be the Dearest
As has been done several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a noticeable decline in service prices.
In so doing, in virtually all the countries where virtual operators were created, classic operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
Jimi arguments used were practically identical - too small, or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In advanced countries, however, it was precisely in these moments that regulatory authorities hit, which defended not the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Whether by formal measures or by informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created and packed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities throw the whole case over as hot potatoes.
In our experience, we can't help but feel that they're more than welcome to be unclear about the competences in these cases.
But let's not throw the flute into the rye.
If background information is correct and the virtual operator appears here really soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain insensitive to reject (discrimination) other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling the storm than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four versions of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech State Day presented the new recordings of the state anthem where my home.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra led by Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, chorus presentation and instrumental version.
Kateřina Knežinková and Adam Plachetka took part in the song.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymen.
He previously told the Czech Radio that he deliberately chose to sing solo versions of singers with young representative voices that are distinct and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure both of them were well understood," he said.
The Czech State Anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home first sounded in 1834 on the boards of the Stavov Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlováček Josef Kajetán Tyl, supplemented by music by František Škroup.
She got popular, and people spontaneously took her for their own.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first song became a natural part of the national anthem.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What's the "new" anthem?
Prague public transport will take you to the chip on Wednesday for the first time
Wednesday 1st October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers will be boarded by metro, tram and bus, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At this point, he can get about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day coupon (this will apply from 1 January 2009) while also having their chip card recorded at the information centres and workplaces of the Transport Company in metro stations of the Museum, Bridge, Holešovice Railway Station, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Raj Garden, Kačerov and Luka.
Since yesterday, coupons can also be purchased via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over 400 customers in the afternoon.
Those who start to use the Internet store can definitely forget the windows at the metro stations, where they had to stay regularly in long queues on paper tickets.
The coupon buys it online and on the Opencard card it is uploaded to one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers are at the disposal of a bulkhead with trained service, which will help those interested with online shopping and will also record their purchased coupon on their card," said the project spokesperson Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries it will be possible to load electronic coupons on the Opencard also in self-service slots, which are installed in several vestibules of the subway.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminding ticket markers, and passengers may have noticed them at metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltava.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be 80," he added.
The ticket checks the driver's slot machine
The machine service that starts working tomorrow is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it itself.
The electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
Thus, in suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which are driven mainly by the inhabitants of the towns of Central Bohemia.
"On the trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers, using which they detect the time and frequency validity of coupons," said Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization, who prepares the timetables of Prague public transport.
The suburban buses have card readers built into the cash register at the driver's.
Therefore, not only does a chip card need to be shown to the driver, but it is also necessary to attach the Opencard to the designated location on the side of the cash register.
This will check the validity of recorded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drapal added.
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and do not remember when their coupon ends can go back to self-service machines where card coupons are recorded.
Here the information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the display of the device.
Sudety wanted a U.S. referendum
In 1945, the Sudet Germans asked for the integration of Sumava into the United States.
It comes from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Research Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the auspices of the United States of America at least.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudetian Germans reportedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is based, among other things, on a letter that has been preserved in one private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Research Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in a letter from the President of the United States not to allow the return of "Sumava County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of a Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly, and we really want to be sure by the words that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says the letter, "People to whom the fate of Sumava lies."
Because the connection to Czechoslovakia is allegedly giving the Sudetian Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - the hope of brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, begs the authors of the letter of the President of the United States to take over Šumavou by the protectorate for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you, regardless of the opinion of a quarter million people, would grant this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and refutes minorities and nothing, without contributing to the victory of the Allies," says the letter.
The reason why authors can't sign is because of the vendetta of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted the thinking of the Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum on whether his citizens wanted to become a part of the United States or to live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in postwar history today, according to some memoirs, it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudetian Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that this would be a move from the Republic, few of them even accepted such an opportunity.
Some expected that the United States and the United Kingdom would negotiate some kind of autonomy with the Sudets.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Ceske Budejovice.
In the war, he was like a Budejovic German set up for the Navy in Balt.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prisoner camp in Holštýn, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them in Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would need Czech language," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia expected to be removed from the republic on the basis of the Benes decrees.
You don't think - you're gonna pay!
The campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive events focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday could be characterized.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to discourage the driver from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on TV, radio, cinema, Internet, as well as flyers.
It should discourage the driver from driving fast and drinking behind the wheel.
And remind them that before they leave, they should chain themselves.
His conscience is especially for young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what happens in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's what the "blood" slogan of the whole campaign says:
You don't think - you're gonna pay!
The word "don't you think" is written in capital letters on an espouse.
And in the pool of blood is the word "pay."
This is supposed to symbolize that a person can pay by his own life in a moment of inattention.
Audiences will be "haunted" until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of accidents can be commonly seen.
He promises to reduce accident and death on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
"The sugar and whip system applies to the driver.
Sugar for them is that, for example, when they go red, they save time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says the transport psychologist at the hospital at Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, a psychologist.
According to him, the tables are no longer effective, which alert the driver to the danger.
"If a static warning board is installed against danger, it will probably come into contact with the surrounding area and the drivers will not be paying attention to it," said Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the Interim Government of Ehud Olmert spoke for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. Prejordania, East Jerusalem and the Golan highs, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published on Monday by the Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all territories will have to be returned (occupied) if not all," said Olmert.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to pass a similar percentage to the Palestinians (Israel) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that the possible return would include Eastern Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want tractors or bulldozers to run over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in an injunction on two July attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, a sacred and historic place", which lies within the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate the 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke for the departure of Israel from the Golan Heights, which, according to him, is an irresistible condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort by Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria only by leaving Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know what they're going to have to give up to get the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up the permanent support provided by Hamas (Shiite movement) terrorism, the Al-Qaeda (Terrorist networks) and the Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stated.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewardesses on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a long distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises as to whether the stewards and passengers can move on the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is contrary to the law on road traffic," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
The accident that killed the 22 - year - old stewardess last week was apparently caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats reserved.
But the bus can crash, or it can get cold, even when the steward is delivering coffee or newspaper.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with standing places according to the technical licence.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
The Student Agency’s long-distance buses do not have places to stay; this is confirmed by Radim Jančura’s director.
"This is what the Ministry and I have been dealing with, and at first we have not allowed passengers to move.
Then they called it off, and we reached out that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have a seat," he said.
The law of the stewardess does not know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stewardess - no legislation solves this role.
However, no legislation or regulation prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the conductor of the vehicle; its rights and obligations are not defined," the spokesperson Hanzelka adds less clearly.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, Head of the Road Vehicle Service Department of the Ministry of Transport, considers that the issue of the law is being treated sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus in the approval is allowed to stand.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban places with maximum speed limits, intercity spaces with higher authorised speeds and long distances with maximum permitted speeds and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
Expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Horín in the movement of stewardesses on board the bus does not see a major problem.
"When driving smoothly, there is no danger, the situation can be compared to the service in planes.
It's not even certain when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can hit the head."
"If, however, the bus was to quench, of course, there are laws of physics.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of stewardesses must be addressed by internal regulations," he says and also means, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the service
The Student Agency offers stewards services as the only bus carrier.
He employs 200 of them.
Even after the accident, the Director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But once I get the impression that the profession of stewards is risky, I'll cancel them.
The coffee and the newspaper can be served by passengers on boarding.
It would save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA, justified the absence of stewards in his cars.
"We don't have stewardessesses, we've been up against it all along.
Sooner or later, it will end in some fatal accident," he said for Week.cz less than a year ago.
There's been an enormous tragedy.
A young stewardess from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, died in an accident of the link link to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably went off without using the guideline from the lane and blocked the bus path.
His driver tried to avoid the sharp maneuver, but he failed the right front part.
That two places reserved for the rest of the stewardesses would be sold out, Jančura refuses.
"These places can't be reserved for remote connections, they're blocked."
The company's going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's ortel, but also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The amendment of the law?
In sight
The specification of the movement of stewardesses on board the bus could bring an amendment to the law, which is being worked on by the 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport for more than a year.
"But there was no concrete conclusion.
Buses don't even solve too much, more like a point system, maximum speed on the freeway and use of a mobile phone when driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the action of stewardesses to be something that significantly jeopardises the safety of passengers," concludes spokesperson Hanzelka, with the fact that the control of bus safety is within the competence of the police and labour safety authorities.
Düsseldorf's hope is Frankfurt
Great words in a letter from the Board of Directors of WestLB to the employees of this bank are not missing.
By combining the units of this Düsseldorf money institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central institutions of the savings group for trading in capital markets," we will read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
In accordance with a letter to this transaction, WestLB will bring in a "principle of competences" providing long-term returns.
And it is said that such a connection can be a decisive impulse for further association in the banking sector.
Such texts arise when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a difficult period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose communication to the Government of the Land in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
The connection between Deka-Bank, which the savings customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, is, however, being spoken for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas, at the presentation of six-year results of the economy at the end of August, heard that in the merger of his mainzer Landstraße bank with some of the land banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, they did not see any sense.
However, the Management Board of Deca-Bank, which is held from one half of the Land Bank and from the other half of the savings unions, entrusted the Board with conducting interviews with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be transactions in or part of the capital market.
But the conversations have just begun, as the financiers point out.
Deka-Bank, which is one of the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not mentioned for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked like there might be a merger between Deka-Bank and Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba Bank.
There was nothing at all from this triangular group.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Hessen government expressed itself against the participation of Helaba.
Even the two other banks didn't connect like that.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Even so, speculation about Deka-Bank's connection with the Landesbanks repeatedly appeared.
However, recently, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, has expressed his speculation about the link between his financial house and others.
However, it seems independent of this belief that the approximation of the various public sector banking houses is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, the BayernLB could be the first to draw a connection to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure on further mergers is to increase, it gradually loses potential partners for such mergers.
In the south, only the second violin would play, despite the fact that the financial crisis so far faces significantly better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
In the early part of the year, the Union of Savings and Žirin Banks of Hessen-Thüringen, which holds a five-eighty percent stake in Helaba, banned the link with WestLB.
That's what Nord LB would look like at most.
However, the geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, the question is how much the business models of individual institutions are aligned.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of what business model would be to ensure the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks, the German Savings Association and the giraffe banks had not yet responded.
Everything could also end with the spread of WestLB, which no one wants in this institution, of course.
Therefore, the letter of the local board also mentions that they are trying to "comprehensive solutions" for the entire bank house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual folders to Deka-Bank, will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend with the Italians"
It's the first time for Elena, for Luca for the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena's gonna be like his girlfriend, and she says everything's gonna be different, she says.
Behind them, with Kaiser's five litre barrel, stands a stronger beard and two hundred tourists on Oktoberfest proves how deep the tone can deliver his throat.
Elena's gonna spank Luca first, and then she's gonna kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From there, from the bus park next to the station Puorta Nuova, four buses will leave this evening at 23.45, marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", supposed to arrive at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly filled by Italians, the Brazilians are on one bus alone.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans have already sung their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who's wearing a long coat with a fur-like lining and glasses with wide silver arms, these three buses belong.
He's been going to Oktoberfest with them for five years, only this year he's holding three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 10:30 left back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast by Kaiser beer, prepared according to the Bavarian law on beer purity, health insurance and a German speaking guide - Marco went to a language course in Frankfurt.
The buses go out into the night, on the highway towards "Brennero."
Beer's not served, not yet.
The bus shuts up fast, the passengers are asleep.
They're doing good, they're gonna need their powers.
He stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where he takes one more break on highway 8 in front of Munich and many more buses with an Italian license plate.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwies at 7:30 a.m., there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has a final speech, explaining the plan of the attack.
First of all, put on the yellow cap.
It says "Oktoberfest", next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersivgiaggiando.it".
And two: "When the door opens in a beer tent, run!" Marco calls for the morning air.
"Go!" Go and fill the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not ahead, so you don't cross over, not all the yellow hats on the same bench, spread over the space!"
Maz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tips.
"Show the nurses we're being polite.
Once you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Three: "Be here again tonight at 11 p.m." Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with beer tents.
On the way one member of the group hangs the yellow hats as signs on trees, signs and even on the electoral poster of one large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare to retreat.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend with the Italians".
Precise data about the number of visitors are not available; it is said that fifty thousand people who travel across the Alps and fall into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend arrived from Italy.
A number of Munich police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrol, and Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which carries out national statistics in which the Italians before the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments take the first place.
The state of Hofbräu is especially popular with the Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Last week, the Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this policy used the word 'rare' and the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared by the crisis development has also been mixed up in its claim.
Because the one about last weekend has come.
The Dax Index, a monitored financial house specialising in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE), will receive a loan of several billion from the consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the credit assistance would go up to EUR 35 billion.
Interest will have to pay Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the actual amount exhausted.
They say that money comes from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary of Depfa.
According to the newspaper report, this state financier was extremely short-term refinancing into long-term projects for which he borrowed money, which is no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve shrunk by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the share of equity decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 %.
Normal income and net income from financial transactions decreased to zero compared to last year, income from the increased value of receivables and certain securities, as well as the abolition of the credit trading reserves, decreased by more than 70 % to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher compensation revenues for subsequent clearing costs during the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the reimbursement of interest under the tax rules and the intermediation of trade for the group companies was the 16 % decrease on the income side still moderate.
The former state financier, after his privatisation in 1990, burned himself on mortgages for traders, which were then allocated from the service portfolio and further maintained by Aareal Bank.
As the classical state funding was too low, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and she was internationally diversifyed.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate now has to write down something, and these write-offs will have a "essential material effect" on the calculation of the profit and loss of the whole group, as some have been indeterminately heard.
The fact is, there won't be a dividend.
It has already been reduced by two-thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been an important financier of state and infrastructure projects since Depf was taken over.
More strongly than other institutions, it depends on refinancing in the interbank market because it does not have any customer deposits.
After the downfall of the US investment bank, Lehman Brothers practically dried up the source of interbank loans two weeks ago because the banks are guarding the liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for a part of the Depfa loan portfolio a year - around EUR 50 billion.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the financial need of the group is covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected "from the influence of international money markets currently largely incompetent functions".
Other sources have been heard that these funds ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the market competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group is now ensured.
That's what shareholders and creditors hope.
But given the dynamics and inconsistencies of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan would not need to be fully exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank was standing in front of insolvency on Sunday afternoon, it seems that it cannot, although preliminary, calm down the rescue.
The share rate has fallen by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, the bond courses were good.
While senior debt has practically not moved, secondary bond rates are losing more significantly.
This applies primarily to the bonds of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo and logically bonds with maturity after 2009.
The mortgages of Hypo-Real-Estate originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood depending on the stability of the international financial system, following a marked exacerbation of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself which brought it into the company by taking over Depf.
As long as the emission banks, governments and less affected trading banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to expect the payment of securities within their maturity.
But it may also happen that almost no one dares hope at present - in the next 15 months, the financial crisis will be overcome.
However, with the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalisation, only legitimate hope has now become a certainty bordering.
This is particularly likely to prepare a number of sleepy nights for long-term creditors to decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the limit line at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to exchange rate yields of subsequent years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the secret box bento
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is introduced on the first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls start to glamorize: the German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from mang, and on her new blog about exchange, she's talking about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train in Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way. Fortunately, I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not given as strictly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine o'clock starts a short session with the teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But before the class started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone 40 students.
Because I wasn't wearing my school uniform yet, I wore my old hostess dress, my blouse, my blue underpants, and my black leather shoes.
Thus, I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sajonara Wo še Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and it is my birthday in a week.
At that point, I was so glad that I started learning my language two years ago.
All 31 girls in class were whispering, giggling and waving, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangs.
It is one of the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly sailed into my seat.
The girl next to me smiled wide enough, considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong came in, they literally flooded me.
They were talking through each other and giggling and asking me about the possible and impossible - and yet it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
By intermission, everyone unpacked their Bents.
My host mother also made me this lunch box - and it's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some fish in tofu dough.
Most of the time, I don't know what I'm eating right here in Japan.
These things look strange and they taste quite new.
Sure thing is, everything's really good.
Well, except for the salt-loaded plums, bro!
Benta at Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a custom-made bento, which in this case is especially artistically modified, and hopes to know a boy in a snack about a break.
I read about that in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I'll see this too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
And then I always said,
'Cause I'm just fascinated.
After all, I've been reading mango for years.
And to understand these comic books and their culture better, I started learning Japanese once.
It was clear to me, then, that one day I would have to come here.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And these are highly valued.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or cockroach flees from danger, does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how could it be possible to verify that they feel the same way when they act like us?
For several years, the internet magazine "Edge" has published the contributions of well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in his series presents the selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it when we can't even prove that consciousness has other people.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to devote ourselves to another species and open the questions of perception or general awareness, we enter the insufferable terrain because the hardware does not match.
If a rat gets in danger, it will do the same thing as many other animals: it will pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
People act in a similar way, of which some scientists consider comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal living.
This is because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its share of short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems that other creatures are completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that a person differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could conceal the linguistic nature of a person: since so much of his perception is associated with the tongue, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if consciousness did not matter in the language, the language would certainly affect it, so animal consciousness, however designed, would probably differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to figure out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it cannot even measure itself, because of its special hardware, to analyse itself based on our own experience, it puts us in the face of great problems.
Most of my basics relate to the content of conscious experiences, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically easier to access.
It would be possible to examine processes in animal consciousness regardless of their content, and that is exactly what is happening in the short-term memory studies in primates, especially in the case of visualization.
But this approach, devoted to Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on neural corelates of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: they can both be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also underlines the importance of the unfrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
It's from the fact that an emotional system like the fear system is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of a defense system located in the brain (or its consequences such as body reactions) uses operational memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of cortex, which are characterized by primates, and especially humans.
In connection with linguistic nature, a fine gradation of perception arises, because using words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorize states so that we can assign them to others.
On the other hand, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in cortex and brain strain areas, similar to Jaak Pankseep, which is more focused on the brain stem.
Because this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could participate in feelings perceived by multi-species.
I can't technically oppose it, but I think it's inconclusive.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us in rats and humans as fear is likely to feel the same way: How can it be verified, however, does Pankseep continue to say whether rats and humans feel the same way when they act alike?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere resemblance of behavior cannot prove the harmony of experience.
True, neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, on the other hand, cockroaches and brains.
But is the brain strain responsible for the feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it with a human being, how would we like to prove it with rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and languages), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
Anyway, in this case, we can look forward to progress at the neural level if we measure the same with rats and humans.
As with rats, I don't explore language and consciousness, I don't explore feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It can be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platini: A period of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be run directly by the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME together with Poland," said Vasjunyk.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries."
In early implementation of the time plan for construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are wandering.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will decrease from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said President of the Ukrainian Union Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN has been revoked and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecki.
They say there is a "serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki Polish Press Agency PAP.
"We have assured President Michel Platini by letter that the preparation for ME 2012 will not suffer from this step."
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to forced descent only last season because of manipulation, and in the end he had to move the start of the league on an urgent basis.
Disgusting Dennis Quaid Returns Strike
She wanted to do an ad for a new movie, she talked about private stuff, and now she's having trouble with her ex-wife, Hollywood star Meg Ryan, talking about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage wrecker.
He's furious and he's coming back.
Late-war roses with the former marriage couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are having a nasty argument - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan spoke to the American magazine InStyle for the first time last week about the failure of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she didn't know about the scale of the scam until after the divorce.
The PR of Ryan's work for her new film "The Women" was the highlight of this mental striptease.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: She's "crazy," said a 45-year-old actor of the New York Daily News newspaper that "Meg repeatedly chews on the history of our relationship and adjusts it".
In addition, it is "politicizing" that the 16-year-old son Jack again "is publicly resembling the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child."
While Ryan's been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a twin father.
He ends his thoughts on bending as follows: "My life is going on anyway.
I consider myself happy to have an amazing family that is doing well."
Flights and hotels dropping
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one current study, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels again discounted - this is the result of a study of the American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made from the first half of 2008 and, after rising prices in the first quarter, found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After a few years of rising prices on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already been cheaper.
Between January and March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities monitored by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most noticeable was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The reason for this trend is that the American Express considers a weak dollar exchange rate, which has caused the "declining taste of American tourists to travel".
Financial centers were also more affected by lower hotel prices than industrial centres, such as Hannover, Cologne and Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices even recorded a European record by increasing 26.3 percent.
Flight prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in kerosene passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-distance flights even increased by 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, flights in the Economy class dropped with an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but changes in knowledge were less pronounced in the Business and First-Class classes.
In Germany, prices fell even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11.9 percent increased, the second quarter decreased by 23.6 percent.
In German national years, according to the quoted study, prices fell by even half.
One reason for this price fall is slowing economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement that liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
The result of the tense situation is the disruption of non-aeronautical airlines as well as the high number of airlines that launched a competition in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV gets to the head of the table.
The Luhukays are no longer able to build a functioning eleven in Borussia.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge the unsuccessful landing for the representative of Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach got involved in the game late and failed to use the stick balloon.
His report was precise and resonating from his mouth convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the cabs of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break ended, and most people sat in their seats again.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades and has enjoyed greater respect than a long-term actor.
So his request was also answered in the responsible place.
Coach Cornelius Jol's assistant drew his thumb on the sign of conformity.
Cornelius is the brother of head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order was probably similar: I'm with a second goal!
No execution.
"It wasn't looking at everything well today," admits Marcell Jansen later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would've "want to be more relaxed."
For 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgians owe the head Mladen Petrić (11) and the fact that the very weak Gladbashans could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV this Monday will celebrate 121 years of its existence.
So on Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and a live-updated table on the videowall in which their team was presented as a premium.
It'll be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate this," said Marcell Jansen.
They suspect that the continuous table result symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly located, but can not yet flash.
"We need more emotion and more dribling," Jol said.
After slaughter in the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package led to a drop in the Dow Jones index by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow gained something again.
Around 8:30, this world's most important stock barometer showed a 5% drop to 10 579 units.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was with more than seven percent minus 1548 points.
The worst of it was in Dowoy at this point American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Goldman Sachs' shares have lost almost ten percent.
Up until a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffett had a stake in this company.
Within the framework of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called damaged mortgage paper.
However, the whole amount should not be paid at one time, but in several stages.
In return, the State is expected to receive stock-based stock-lists of financial companies, which could be repaid in favour of the exchange-rate development, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Exchange courses in Europe are falling steeply
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not relieve investors of doubt.
The share rate of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly descending and is downloading the Dax index with it.
The American Dow Jones index is losing its way despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular exchange rate losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have taken the German stock index (Dax) down to the minus.
Despite the rescue operation of the Federal Government and private banks, Commerzbank lost up to three quarters of its value.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important limit of 6000 points and with a minus 3.7 percent he scored 5 839 points.
Stock markets have gone to their knees all over the world.
In New York City, Wall Street began a business day with significant losses.
Investors fear that a $700 billion bailout of US government would not have been enough to reinvigorate financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent during the first trading hour, and is at 10 809.25 points.
The American House of Representatives has to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could express itself on 1 October.
The other European exchanges were only in one direction: in London, the FTSE index first decreased by 3.2 percent, and CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index of Nikkei dropped by 1.26 percent to 11,743,61 units after initial profits.
In Hong Kong the Hang-Seng index dropped by 2.1 percent to 18 286.90 points.
In India, the leading index of Sensex lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and the trade ended at a value of 12.595.75.
In the MDAx, they lost Arcandor's share capital after the announcement.
Sal. Oppenheim private bank signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourism company announced that Thomas Cook will not sell its shares.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years scientists have been unaware of one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts are concerned that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
She is now at risk of death in winter because of the fuel lines that will soon freeze.
Among the scientists, for years, one mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion - an anomaly of the gravitational workmanship.
The gravitational praxis is an aerial maneuver of space probes, which generates additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as the Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have said for years in this case is astonishment: flying bodies are not acting 100% as a person would expect under the good old gravity law.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the gravitational anomalies.
Several experts are concerned that perhaps even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not mistaken and is trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational work by using the so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"A dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Space explorers have known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously based on gravitational force, the effect of which on other space bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not transmit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, tourists are once again freed, according to a message from the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt.
The kidnappers in Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were killed in the shooting before the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
I hear the ransom negotiations are on the run.
The Germans are repeatedly becoming the target of the kidnappers.
WeLT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
The European tourists are apparently free to go to the Sahara.
This was reported jointly by Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
According to Italian TV station Sky TG 24, the Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were liberated.
We are verifying their medical condition," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian State Television report, five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian woman, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert seem to be on their way to Cairo.
The background of the firefight before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to the Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed with the ransom," said the quoted worker.
He said, "It was just about taking over," when suddenly "this surprise" came in.
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and captured two of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" with appeals to one of the German agents said that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were worried about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
Men should have been held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse by stepfathers "successful suicide"
A number of abuses by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself, to be heard in court.
After he confessed to eight cases of sexual harassment, seventy-seven-year-old Michael Treris of Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court of Truro heard that Stephanie Randle was regularly tied up with his stepdaughter when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treris wrote in his confession.
It was also said in the court that Miss Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the court, it was said that Miss Randle, who spent a significant part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, was persecuting the appearance of abuse that was committed twice a week.
The plaintiff Ramsey Quaife in court stated that in 2006, Ms. Randle's friends, who was also very involved in surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and that "she gave up life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's supposed to be suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle faced his stepfather's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with words: "I tied her up and tied her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris: "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been horrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the sacrifice taking its own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn't done so, the case would probably never have gotten to trial."
"I would particularly like to stress the consequences that Stephanie's parents thought your crime against their daughter over the years," he added.
"She'd probably be a promising, successful, happy young woman otherwise."
The officer who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top secret documents on the Waterloo train when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
Documents were put in the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It's the least serious offense against that law, and nothing suggests a criminal intent.
The BBC's defense writer Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was being dealt with internally between the Ministry and the Government Office," he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed is accused under Section 8.1 of the law in question, a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police prosecute the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained classified Al-Qaeda analyses and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown place.
Cooperative reserves face B&B debt
British cooperatives may have to deal with more than £80 million of debt after saving Bradford & Bingley.
The government provided £14 billion to protect deposits of 2.6 million in Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperatives.
The Director-General of the Association of Cooperatives (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "embarrassing" that they and their members must pay.
The 14 billion-dollar debt will eventually be paid back by saving Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest that is still in the meantime will be paid each year by all 700 financial companies that take client deposits.
The Fund The financial service plan for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 cooperatives are set off in this figure.
It is humiliating that these institutions, who have behaved prudently... must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from being so prudent
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that every firm has to pay proportionally to the deposits it held and that the deposits are supposed to pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will increase to £450 million in 2009.
That means they're going to have to find £81 million to pay off the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Cooperative Trade Association, told the BBC that it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved prudently during the housing market boom must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from being so prudent."
According to BSA, no deposit has been dropped since 1945 when it appeared.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what the possibilities of protecting cooperatives and their members from an account that could be relevant," said Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of this September until the end of March.
In 2010, there will be interest for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Given that cooperative deposits are non-equity holding organisations, the account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk increases by fivepence per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by fivepence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-cent increase in February, and it comes after research carried out by a consultancy company.
Retailers are asked to decide for themselves whether or not they want to reflect in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
Bail for the Bangladeshi Expremier rejected
The Bangladesh court has rejected the request of former Prime Minister Shaich Hasina Vajid to be released on bail, which means that if he returns to the country, he may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the allegation that she had acquired over $50 million from a certain businessman when she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several charges of corruption against it.
Khalida Ziyaova, a long-standing political rival of Shaich Hasina, was released earlier this month on bail.
Shaich Hasin is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League, asked that the local army held by the government first give her full freedom.
The writers say that while she was released on an honorary word to undergo a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear, according to the terms of her release, whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she is now referring to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Shaikh Hasina's request for bail, saying that she doesn't need bail when she is already under an investigation on a declaration of honor abroad," said Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the orders of the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Shaich Hasina was to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after an army held by the interim government took over power, but was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for medical treatment.
Shaych Hasin and Chalida Ziyá both reject all the charges against each other.
Fear of vaccination against armor in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200,000 children were not involved in the recent plough vaccination against the Taliban because of the violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations was carrying out vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says that for security reasons she could not reach the children in the south in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
A UN spokesperson stated that this happened despite Taliban promises that he would not attack or stop thousands of vaccine workers at work.
BSkyB lost a lawsuit about ITV
BSkyB lost a judicial dispute to review the Commission’s decision on competition, which ordered the company to reduce its share in ITV’s competitive broadcasting.
The Board of Appeal for Competition of BSkyB ordered that it reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % to 7,5 %.
The Commission previously stated that BSkyB’s share was in short supply and gave disproportionate influence to ITV.
BSkyB purchased a stake in 2006 in a trade which, as a result of preventing TL, now renamed Virgin Media, bought ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of a share in ITV by BSkyB of BSkyB had given rise to doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
The head of the Virginia consortium, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer organization and the Ofcom regulator, were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a disproportionary solution - especially because BSkyB had previously said that she was willing to waive her voting rights.
New investigation into the American lawyers' affair
The US Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The report on the affair drawn up by the Supreme Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticised the White House officials, the legislator and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to undermine justice.
In the report, General Inspector Glenn Fine stated: "Serious allegations, including potential crime, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force the Witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice removed nine American lawyers in December 2006 from their duties.
At that time, the Ministry stated that lawyers were released because of weak performances.
However, later it turned out that the release of lawyers was no worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecution of high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate the accusations of electorate deception against Democrats.
American lawyers are investigating and prosecuting in judicial cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Minister Alberto Gonzales, went under fire because of his release and eventually resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The general inspector's report was very critical of the role of Gonzales in the affair, saying that he was "main responsibility" for the release, that he "abdicated" from his leading position and in the event of "not surprisingly involved".
Other officials, including former High Bush advisor to Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will come to London for his special gold prize next weekend, said he was "worshiped" by the recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and 50 seconds, was the headline of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Nominations for this year are led by the Coldplay group, which came into the short selection in four categories.
Paul Rees, the main editor of the Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
A song written by Jim Steinman needed the big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that took almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and peaked in 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell was in the ranking for about nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was also operated because of irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel his concerts.
Later it turned out he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Occurrence streets, often forgotten and perhaps early for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other land-based communications, some famous, other only useful.
But even a lot of vets and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This little alley is in East Village, leading north of First Street without getting to Second Street between Bowery and Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of 40 meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic move.
There are no street names signs.
It's practically invisible in the usual atlas.
Still, my aisle has admirers.
For example, the company Avalon Bay, the developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to redecorate Extra Place and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are long-standing neighbors who say that they were enthralled by the short alley simply because it was one of the last remains of the time the block was developed.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of Buildings, which the street has in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At the meeting of the Municipal Community Land Committee, representatives of the Municipal Office and Avalon Bay outlined a plan to buy the street developer.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the regional manager of the Community 3, the Committee favours such an option when the streets remain in the hands of the city and asks for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its ownership," she said.
"There could be proposals for repair and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to freshen up a small street and settle the seats, several of which would use a cafe whose interest in renting the property the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this tainted alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale proposed the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Office for the Maintenance of Construction, said that the city actually wanted to sell the street, and noted that the task of his office was to develop assets rather than manage them.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when the big farm Philip Minthorn was divided among several of his children and on that narrow stripe of the country nobody made a claim.
The back door of CBGB, a punkrock monument closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps the best known as the background photo on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, Ramones manager, who took a picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers, who write about the processing of the East Village district, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, although modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place to be a rarity - almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Disappearing New York (with the subtitled "Book of Compassion: A bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), posted part of the story about Extra Place from the section Talk about the city that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even in the daytime and bordered by rusty iron warehouse doors and broken windows, where a week's old newspaper runs through the streams."
Except for a few exceptions, the alley of a recent night looked exactly the same.
The rat ran through a blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, where there is a store of expensive clothing today.
On the walls there was graffiti and next to the fresh dose of dropped newspapers there was an empty beer bottle.
A couple of passers said they rarely think of Extra Place, but they suggested that he could use some kind of boost.
On the other hand, Fields said that he thinks that some people underestimate the impressiveness of the alley in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in places dark, wet and disgusting."
Debate on biking quality: immersion into English
In this edition of the section Focused on education Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic from California and the Director of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Better Than You Think: Why Do High Class Need To Choose Schools"?
Addressing Hispanic voters effectively is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama's educational agenda just proves it.
Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white pupils," which is true.
To fight such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda particularly, among other things, "transient bilingual education" for those who only learn English.
The question of Barack Obama is, however, whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasises the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles County East.
The pupils of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are only learning English.
Still, in the state tests of mathematics in 2008, it reached the highest level of incredible 100 percent of fourth grade pupils.
Almost as amazing as 90 percent of fourth grade pupils have reached the highest level in state tests in English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street highlights control and practice, continuous assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Furthermore, and Obama should notice that, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the pedagogy approach school for those who only learn English, is "full immersion".
Immersion into English underlines the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, said to me: "We had a tremendous success with one completely new student from Mexico - after 12 months you would go into class and not know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model, how should other schools with large shares of Hispanic and English pupils look like?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer to this question obvious, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Educational Association is a longstanding supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make the predictions of Obama’s reply unclear.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he declared that people should stop worrying about "only the English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work rather than mock them and trivialize them.
Oil falls sharply due to renewed economic fears
Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the US plan to save the financial markets would not have had to revive the economy.
The prices of oil futures dropped in the morning trade on the New York Commodity Exchange by up to 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street and by a pair of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, earlier this month, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel, and then again, a wave of huge uncertainty of financial markets jumped.
Anxiety re-engaged investors on Monday, even after the Congress Presidency announced that on the weekend it reached agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report has been overshadowed by recent concerns that the financial crisis is far from complete.
In the latest episode of the progressive decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would buy Wachovia Corporation’s banking unit.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Governments partly nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frenzy weekend negotiations that led to the economic recovery plan "are proving to be unable to revive the mood on the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, commodity demand, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for global stock markets, interest rates and exchange rates were highly uncertain," the analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in the report to investors.
"We believe commodities will not be able to escape from the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus spreads worldwide and especially to China."
The Bank’s analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, as oil consumption has fallen due to slower economic growth, and they have reduced their petrol price forecasts for 2009 by about 20%.
Wild ride in the second quarter beats the team's record
After spending more than anyone in the last eight seasons in a Jets uniform, the defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
Then he watched the development of the second quarter on Sunday, in which Jets turned the pointless game into a fantastic ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizona Cardinals settled the troublesome clouds above themselves with their troubled game.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Coles to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, thus perfectly predicting the afternoon in which their progressive cooperation moved a mile forward.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter for another two touchdowns, including the one where he fell the cornerback, and another 10 seconds before the half-fight.
"It was nothing unusual," Favre told Coles about all his passes.
"He's a hell of a player.
We've been communicating well, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense attacked the quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned it by 32 yards to the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith figured out another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to go to jail.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, may have been the best.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, he kicked Jay Feely's twenty-yard goal out of the field, thereby gaining lead 34-0.
That's the most Jets have ever won in a quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said: "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
Many points fell in a short period of time."
Rested Gebreselassia improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-range runner ever when on Sunday on the Berlin marathon he beat his own world record and became the first person to run 26.2 miles long race under two hours and four minutes.
The victory on a pleasantly flat track in time 2:03:59 overcame his previous time 2:04:26 in Berlin by 27 seconds.
Gebreselassia, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly unbelievably wide - overcame the world record or is at least a world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassia left the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because he was afraid - perhaps even too scared to see it - that polluted air would cause his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees in the finish - won on Sunday Gebreselassia with a flashy average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have focused on longer tracks, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil has won Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told the press that he had convulsions in the calf two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Apparently, the break got him better than delayed.
"I'm so happy," he told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I was in a bit of a doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African Rival of Ethiopia - because he was overly planning his races, generally avoiding the world's marathon peaks, relying on conductors, as if it were a race on the track, and building world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassi's enormous running quality.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached half in time 1:02:04.
After the conductors dropped, Gebreselassi was constantly being chased by two elite Kenya runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal of Gebreselassia last took up and escaped to Kwambai, who then ran second in time 2:05:36 and improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi ended up third at 2:07:48.
At the Women's Race, she finished her excellent year with the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitěnková, a native from Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Recordtime 2:15:25 keeps Paula Radcliff from the UK.
36-year-old Mikitěnková won surprisingly last spring in the London marathon at 2:24:14.
The Beijing games missed something that was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and the third marathon that ever ran, improved its personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape into a big lead and then she reached them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia came second at 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop from Kenya ended third at 2:25:01.
Proudness and Obstacles of Black People's Life in a Separate City
Hidden among the vast amusement parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles away from all the shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and the difficulty of African-American life is revived.
Eatonville, the first completely black city that was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as easy as it was described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courses, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough quay, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Zora Festival to pay their respects to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains aside, although she made it a stop for tourists by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many of the people here remain cautious of the views of strangers.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of black growth and a community of almost 2400 people, where the rate of poverty is doubled compared to the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also of oak, a shielded example of the southern country's black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that was created by American slavery.
It is not surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And the concern about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way that Hurston is called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of wails like "Mules and Men (Muly and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida Tourist Guide changed the town a short way to road 17, which leads through the often passed centre of Florida, on stage black history and human drama.
With the rank of a big drum in life and literature, Hurston introduced her reader to the store of the first Eatonville mayor Joe Clark, and then she turned to more private places.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "there's a white brown decorated modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into the hourly hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville has connected itself to the government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
This clearly wasn't a typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls' choir, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she said.
She still remembers Hurston as a fluffy eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time when she crashed into town, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in the city, which is also proud of decent clothes today.
Most of the people were fascinated, said Franklin, but many were grinning.
"The people of Zoru have always loved to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville, along with the rest of the world, seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, the present of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no major funeral rituals or big public readings.
"I think neither her meaning for the world nor her legacy was understood at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's resume "Wraped in Rainbows (packed in rainbows)" published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
The representatives of Orange County wanted to stretch a five-speed highway through the city instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a local two-way route.
The spread of Orlando has already pushed interstate highway 4 across the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ’ s, the struggle for mixing the races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things at people who sat on the side," Franklin said.
"We actually had a lady here who killed it.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel of 1955, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court's request for forced integration and his decision in the Brown case against the Education Chamber, saying that it was "for my race insulting rather than celebrating."
Residents now claim that school desegregation, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
"Black kids were used to being hugged - I remember - you hugged your teacher this morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Natiri, Elly Dinkins' daughter and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This took time until teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," said Miss Nathiri.
However, civil rights helped create space for many more Zory Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, rose above prejudices with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How someone can deny the pleasures of my presence!
I won't understand."
In 1975 Alice Walker arrived at Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a praised résumé of Hurston from Robert E. Hemenway, who re-listed her in an American canon, came to the shelves in the bookstores.
The project with the highway arrived just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville found the lights of the ramp again.
The former Hurston neighbors now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to her freeway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and each January many return to the celebration.
A few years later, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"The five highway streams have resurrected, you'd say it's just blown up, real civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd simply said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the motorway project helped to change the city's image.
Extra-urban like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the local church in 1993, began to appear in more numbers, and the people began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named, of course, after Hurston) was opened in 2006 for the re-asphalled and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orlando can sometimes act as a setting-up alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today is 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come to search for a story and the meaning of Eatonville are still being treated cautiously.
The permission for most interviews must be given in advance and certain things - like wall paintings in the oldest Eatonville church painted by white people and depicting black people in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a courageous, confident teacher who likes to be full of red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
Even as the Hurston festival expanded, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people want to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and as proud, creative, industrious, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnics.
From Franklin's nephew's voice, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, there's an honest love for the village when he's planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in a local government or a police department that he says would use some help.
And even younger ones, such as the 11-year-old twins from the Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonova, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass through here, think, 'Well, this town is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment into history, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak financially.
Nothing's changed at first sight.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newspaper stands and huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in a glass beehive of offices above their heads every day, bankers and managers of investment funds who monopolize New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still rumbling metal carts along the sidewalks and transferring muffin bakers to a breakfast meeting.
Hispanics are still moving between turrets and wearing, like human mules, 50 shirts ironed out, hanging from the turrets on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the street dining stands, and it is still not possible to get a yellow cab between 4 and 7 p.m. on the weekday.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all until I decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon, with all the talk about pessimism.
Even though I timed this task to cover the late afternoon seat at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting in the queue.
Not in front of the cash registers to pick up or store cash, but in front of the counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for a trip to the Macy's mixed goods shop and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason I did.
However, compared to me, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They have collected money from so-called thrifts (a bit similar to building savings), money associations and from those types of savings companies whose branches operate in only one state and who claim to take care of their customers as a family.
In the last year, 15 such banks have gone down quietly.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets for $327 billion, auditioned, and when the New Yorkers came home on a weekend night, another bank, Wachovia, with assets for $440 billion, tried to hunt down a rescue buyer.
Employees of offices and shops who stood in front of me and feared another collapse moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and which makes most of the rescue on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned financially in the last week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket was talking on the phone and speaking to Lehman Borthers, the failed bank, and her skinny top executive Dick Fuld with the kind of familiality she'd be snooping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, uniformed by my 50-year-old tenant, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation-- Brad, Angelina, or my food shipment.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I have my money market funds now.
I moved it, I won't take any chances."
Muslim graves desecrated by the Austrian right-wing fracture
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right side of the Frees and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right side of the Vlaams Belang participates in the demonstration, which was presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 by the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs showing mosques crossed over by the red line.
The police blame right-wing extremists for desecrating the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which the extremely right-wing parties achieved huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves at Traun Cemetery near Linz were sometimes badly destroyed between Friday night and this morning, and the police are convinced that this was an organized event.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols on some graves, such as David’s star, but the detectives believe that it could have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether this incident has been linked to the elections in any way.
The spokesman of the Islamic community here said that they are "deeply shocked" by the reports of desecration that comes when the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan is approaching the end.
In the meantime, Austria enters the circle of searching for its own soul after the right fell in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both sides of the far right, which won more than 30 percent of the votes, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, led a vehemently anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the Free Party, who won over 18 percent of the vote, protested against the shawls and burries in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to the foods in which the relationship with Islam is perceived.
At the last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke about "European Brotherhood", which is intended to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Research and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which have put the extreme right on the position of the country's strongest political bloc, suggests that this change was mainly caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't go on a trip abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who was convicted of child sexual abuse, banned the court from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
This travel ban was agreed by the Kent police last Thursday after it handed down evidence to officials of Glitter's past convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, by his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
The spokesman of the judicial service said: "On Thursday 25 September, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Kent police asked for a regulation to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not attend personally."
The 64-year-old Glitter has informed the authorities that he wishes to travel abroad, as recorded in his sex offender register.
He has to notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also forward the planned date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If the duty to inform the authorities had been neglected, he could have been sentenced to five years.
Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible trips to the county.
The spokesperson of the Kent police said, "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who will remain in Britain, because we have extensive systems that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent police, and we are carefully working to monitor the behaviour of recorded sexual attackers in order to minimise any danger to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass through the passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London and at the same time successfully requested an order to register him as a sexual assailant.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in possession of child pornography.
The source from the Home Office said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and glad that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I take pictures of the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenca, freed from the focus on interpretation - so I can achieve the relaxed expression of a man or woman.
On one side of the artist.
Second, human.
Inseparable, if we ignore privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, depth of the summer captured view or passionate gesture of hands that are carefree because they are not going to appear on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" theatre performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer draws up a unique iconography of flamenca from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which is taking place in the framework of the Moon photo programme flamenca (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the ever-growing international significance of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the stage.
These "on the street" people are able to carry passion, sadness, joy... and completely impress the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was wondering if I could create a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the character of the great flamenco.
Charmed by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 by portraiting flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the material, resemble a classic photograph.
The application of the different stylistic means is contrary to the classic basis of the image and lends it to the contemporary spirit, which is an idea reflected by Bauer himself by flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which does not cease to surprise and evolve."
It is not the performance of the dance, singing, or playing itself that attracts the audience, but the personality and character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet the most important, the spirit, which appears in the way of perception, being and living, was and is the constant work presented during these days in the El Fotoma gallery.
This selection of nearly seventy photographers is formed by famous flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosová, Enrique Moreente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenca and will soon get a book edition that will contain the portraits displayed.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to the idea of repeating the "Portraits of the Sport Veteran" (SportARTproject) two years ago.
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people" the photographer admits that "photo people, get to know them and have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or only short, to enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in the photograph.
One meets or encounters people, personalities that he sometimes doesn't know or can only give him a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of portraits of the current flamenca called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he was writing was "trust."
It takes place in an environment that he does not know yet and tells about events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for 20 years and traveled in the Amazon.
The eternal favorite of the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia festival admitted that the project that is currently employing him is "trust," and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it, and I believe I will finish it once," he finished his contribution to the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words, which he saw in the city of the aqueduct in about a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main figures of the third year of the celebration of the word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llos, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our Muslim friend" - filled the Juan Bravo theater to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had a dedicated audience before him, whose hour of time passed as water - a Peruvian with amazing accuracy and a great deal of humor remembered how from the original "unbelievable adventure" from the "enjoyment of a passionate reader" and from the "power to live more than what I've lived" gave birth to the literary mission; how he adds "a lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinaryly," carefully worded and rewritten; or how they influenced his writing Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "rememorative images" are the basis of his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a mere fun, elusive experience" - stressed Vargas Llosa with the fact that according to him "on people" and "force them to try to shift from line", and called on the writers to "do not subject to frivolity" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Because of climateology, he loses his ceremony in Pooblanc - missing spears
The performance with spears closing the ceremony in Pooblanc was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the effectors that the surface of the square was not in good condition was confirmed.
That is why the company, along with Fermín Bohórquez, Cable Hermos de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfighting.
The adverse weather conditions have plagued this festival for a long time, two of the three celebrations could not be celebrated.
On Saturday, the rain made it impossible for the second planned bullfighting.
During them, the formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build bulls in the arena on Castillanc.
But this was only happening on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically good performance was carried out on his shoulder.
On the same day in the afternoon, Alejandro Talavanante changed two stab wounds for greetings and one ear, which brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than the Toreadorian art.
Even worse was El Juli, who went through the bull arena Los Llanos unsalted non-fatty.
In the second round of hard work, he earned from most of the audience a sharp criticism.
They ran a check-up in Álava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hash.
In ten minutes, five.
Ertzaintza Road Control in Armiñón District (Alava).
The suitors stop two people driving in the van and they drive away.
The cost, more than two tons of hashish, is unstoppable.
According to a report from the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government, the members were persecuted and detained by one of the persons travelling in a van, a man aged 38 who was identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was accused of smuggling drugs and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out roadside checks at N-1 in places where they cross the border of the city district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop the van to check, but the driver disobeyed instructions, accelerated and ran away.
The car’s members immediately began to prosecute until the vehicle stopped at the edge a few kilometers away, and at that moment both passengers jumped out and fled into the forest.
The Ertzaintza members finally caught up with one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects carried, as it turned out during a tour of Iveco Daily's delivery.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages which were then transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "snatched" and disagreed with the information contained in the delivery documents, and the detainee was therefore also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate the second suspect, who, as has been mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the confiscated drug.
Arrested by A.A.J., 28 years old, he was transferred to the police department to deal with proper formalities before he made further investigations.
Actress Heather Locklear is being arrested for drug-induced driving
Actress Heather Locklear, popular Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, told People magazine spokesperson of California Road Patrol.
The Witness stated that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear "streetly stepped on the gas, she joined the front and back behind the noisy storm and tried to get out of the parking spot - she ran her sunglasses several times while backing up".
A Witness who apparently didn't first recognize an actress saw Locklear's moment after stopping at a nearby highway and getting off the vehicle.
This person also warned the emergency service because she was "feared for Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found an actress inside the vehicle, which partly blocked the road.
"She seemed disorientated" and therefore she was taken to a specialised drug and alcoholic center to undergo a test.
According to the police spokesperson, the actress cooperated and the amount of alcohol was subsequently excluded, yet "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was visible to the officers at first sight".
Locklear was detained for suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 19.00, although she was released for freedom a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian association of the IU to exercise its competence in the case of Silva
The head of the IU and Member of the Joint Left, Gaspar Llamazares, today announced that the final decision in the case of the former Council of Youth and Sport Department of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being charged with negotiations for the benefit of his family, will depend on the regional association of the party.
"I am an excessive federalist, and it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares pointed out, which the party will have to proceed to in relation to a former member of the Sevilla City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that "transparency" is absolutely necessary in the case of an investigation of the illegal act which Silva committed: "IU has always fought for such matters to be as transparent as possible."
Similarly, he stressed that the party had a "strict ethical code for all public functions".
"Mayan blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garcia in the film "May Blood" (Sangre de mayo), inspired by the Episodes of the National Past of Benito Pérez Galdós, revives the famous Spanish uprising against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way the film maker wanted to "paint the eloquence of the characters and analysis of the company", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, today explained together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the film in front of an extensive team of artists.
May's blood with a meteor over two and a half hours will be given to the movies this Friday, and in the future it's going to be a more than four-hour TV series for Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdós José Luis Garcia claims that he fulfilled the "child's dream" by filming this film, due to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid by filming a film on the 2nd anniversary of Madrid on May 2nd, he accepted the offer that the story would be based on the National Past Episode.
The budget of 15 million, which was fully contributed to by the Madrid province, means for Garcia "a unique opportunity" to create an environment with scenes and costumes corresponding to the image of the "convulsive Spain, which was mistaken in the leader for which it fought - the fight for independence led to the decline and lagging of the country during the government of Ferdinand VII," he said.
The director regrets, however, that he cannot count on the financial support that had been given to the films of the Sad Wing (Ala triste) or Goya's Ghosts - almost twice the amount of May's blood - so he could not shoot some of the scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horace Valcárcel, with which he works almost all over his film track.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and empezar) works as he is normally used to - on the stage together with actors, with whom he usually tries before shooting and who do not choose casting because it seems "insuring" to him and also believes that "the director's profession is part of, among other things, going to theatres and cinemas and thus finding out what is going on in the craft he is dealing with".
Many actors who have selected for May's blood have appeared in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, with four nominations for Oscar, one of whom he gained, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May blood itself, the seven tables of the French billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflower, represents the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "it will yet appear".
Garcia expects no award for this film.
"At first, you think you're working for what happens after, but then you realize that you're only working for the profit, so you're willing to make another movie," Garci explains with more than 30 years of director's career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Seville Dancer Toórtola Valencia
The Seville flamenca dancer will pay tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of the father of the Catalan (Florenç Toórtola Ferrer) and mothers of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana district, and when she was three years old, she moved with her family to London.
She danced modern and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering female emancipation like Isador Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the abolition of a corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
This woman's life influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, Isabel Bayón, has bewitched.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about grasping the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of flamenco rhythms.
So a butterfly dance provoked guajira or a thong dance.
Her dance was sensual, and they told me that my dance of this aesthetics also corresponds," she says.
The performance includes the involvement of two exceptional personalities: with Miguel, they will lead Isabel in one performance as in the "Open Doors" (La puerta abierta), and with the dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and joined her former student.
"Matilde represents the older Toórtola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me."
The performance also includes the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paca Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájar, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of the actor Juanfra Juárez, who "has the role of an eternal guide to this kind of artist who is primadonami with everything and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman who took place in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some point in time, but today no one knows her and even less appreciates her work," Bayón says.
The performance starts today at 8:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "New-Married Diary" also closes the triennial
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of the "Dean of the Freshly Married" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Zenobie Triennial and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
The "Zenobie and Juan Ramon" trial is about to end with a new edition of this work, an international congress that will take place in New York, a repair of the Nobel Museum House and a travelling exhibition "Jan Ramón Jiménez: The ray of the sun", which was opened in May this year, and, once the various Andalusian provinces have passed, it should move to New York, according to the plans at the time of the Congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government also ordered eight hundred copies of the "New-Married Diary" by Pedre Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis, to continue the dissemination of awareness of the personality and work of one of the most worldly Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like each other that much anymore.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "No evil intention" and under the weight of the knowledge that Newman left, revealing his dismal vision of abandoned American cinema and America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And they knew he was seriously ill.
Even so, he was for all the guys.
"Sometimes what a person feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better thanks to him."
No one was afraid he'd be ridiculous or exaggerated.
The father of film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom of a desperate search for reasons of pride.
When times are tough and people without virtue and only a handful of those worth admiring - there's no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodyed the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from the drug addiction foundation based on the honor of his firstborn son, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade food and biofood.
A complete treasure for a country that has cost a lot of effort to free itself from a suicidal dietary culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but the whole time.
Another Englishman, the owner of Oscar under the direction of Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without exaggeration the peak of his career.
The evil boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has the troufle of Newman as his greatest source of inspiration.
"This fox has put a pretty high bar on us all," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman today - based on honesty and leads a serious private life far from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He got divorced once, and since then he has been married to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, even though he certainly had more than enough opportunity not to be.
"Why would I go out for a burger when I have a filet at home?" I like to joke.
May he be accompanied by pride in the earth by harmony between his daughters and admirers - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles that he has embodyed, he was most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a self-sacrificing philanthropist."
The imperfect races of the Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after a failed 2012 it will be possible 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we follow the race yesterday, I say no!
He was referred to as the perfect race, and in my opinion, he was the worst thing I've ever been to.
Such a load of nonsense that right now, if it came to the evaluation and I was a rehearsal, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one at a time.
Nonsense starts with picking up a race number for which you have to leave early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when a man goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip to prevent the overflowing of the path).
Oh, no.
Here you had to pick up the number first (the first nonsense, go there only for this) and (after the proper front came out) - what a surprise! - only had a S-Size T-shirt (the second nonsense, because I need the size of XL).
Where do we live?
Is it because of the crisis they decided to buy only small shirts because it's less fabric and they're cheaper?
Well, these are small things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon for the chip and the queue lasted for over 15 minutes, he had to hand in a backpack.
Over 35 minutes, the waiting time lasted, which is in a race where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven't put our bags away yet, and when we did, it was much worse to pick up.
In addition, the waiting extended by 40 minutes the rain, leading to a general rebellion and attack on the cabin.
I believe 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow, and some, like me, will not show the right time to evaluate the results for the chip they gave me and which I suppose did not record the right start time.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't think of this one.
And so I think we're gonna have to let the well-prepared Olympic city dream about.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction on the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic actions such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the entire company) and perceive what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can find out how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also sort out the conversation groups present.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist records a third party and understands that he does not belong to the group that talks to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going to see anyone, and she's telling her she'll be going after her in a minute.
All that without the blue screen of death.
That's amazing.
But, of course, that's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There's been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and they won't have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial unnecessarys, they would have been five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as thunder, considering that Microsoft version from the version adds new features to Windows and more "extra".
A change of direction would be a deserving act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who tended to the theory that it was the first step Google to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
That's right.
They will never disappear, but you need to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as absolute truth, but relative to the truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People increasingly pay less attention to the operating system and vice versa more internet browsers.
The computer turns on to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around the windows.
What is the half of the applications that accompany the system?
There's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering your services online and finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a small example.
I took this photograph at a rest room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the beverage machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your Search. Our Future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft’s employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It's not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's do it with 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay expensively for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Azure Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one glowed in the "Blood Diamond" of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in "The Godfather" of Francis Ford Coppoly, and in addition is part of the uniform of a muscular gay community.
And if we want to get into the list of his life roles, we can dive into the image of a typical muscle with a pointy mustache that lifts weights in a nomadic circus.
In fact, it's no more than a typical cotton man's undershirt, tight and sleeveless.
English spokesmen call him 'tank', but Le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excels over everyone else.
First of all, for his short name - although popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as legend says, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, lovers of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' excels over other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (almost undetectable) Belgian flag, with models of the most embossed t-shirts as the detail of the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company doesn't specialize only in tank tops.
He also produces college hoodies, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy shirts, baby clothes, mini shorts...
Thought out pieces for a comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
A tremendous resemblance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though petty, is a woman full of life.
They're taking the Cruz sisters very seriously now.
It means a lot more to Monica than just that some pretty, famous girl will lend her name.
In Paris, a promotion event was held by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most significant trendy prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's hearty and shy, and she'll get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection, which we proposed for Mango this autumn-winter season with Sister Penélope, while also attending the second edition of "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honour of Valentina.
So it was a difficult but exciting day at the same time.
What's your new collection for Mango that you've been working for for the fourth season?
My sister and I both love films from the '50s and '60s, and we've drawn a lot of inspiration from them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk around dressed, combining their clothes, and the backs of their clothes, I do that very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
Maybe I liked my clothes since I was a kid, and I still wanted to go to my grandmother's, check out my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was awesome, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to keep my clothes on.
You know, we dancers are based on how we're adapted to feel good about our hours and tests when we look into the mirror.
And as an actress, if they give you a costume, then you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 a while ago, did you get into a crisis?
Not at all.
I feel better than I've ever had in my 30s.
I find that a woman is already finished, she has experience, and she enjoys life with less mistakes.
Biological hours don't scare me.
I've been doing what I want since I was a kid, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course I know I'm gonna be a mother, because my body is asking for it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As far as my father's concerned, I'm not worried.
But I know one thing for sure, I will give my child a sense of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As far as the movie is concerned, you're now facing some of the film premieres you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to them coming to the movies.
I come from a theatre world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything now, and of course I can't.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the parade pier next to Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going up to the pier like a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to attend the benefit shows for her "Women for a Better Life" organization, and the clothes we've been doing - I've also picked two models from our Mango collection - it's auctioned and the proceeds have been handed over to Naomi's non-governmental organization.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are said about her, and since I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity purposes, but if she asked me to make a stand, I'd do it too.
For the benefit of third-world women, I'll do whatever it takes.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative sanctions for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his car that prevents him from starting a car in drunkness or if he does not breathe.
The proposal was already known in June of this year and is now included in the Annual Report of the Supreme State Prosecutor, according to which it is a pilot project which will last one year.
Its aim is to return the driver behind the wheel, which is why drivers will also have to take the course of transport retraining.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Car Safety (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of the carers accused more than once for driving drunk, will sit behind the wheel again in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this as it is a system connected to a vehicle which measures the level of alcohol in the breathable air and prevents the start of a car if the driver does not breathe before or if the permitted alcoholic strength is recorded.
Its price exceeds EUR 1,000 and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
The studies carried out in this sense in the USA in 2007 have shown that, for vehicles equipped with this equipment, offences have decreased by 65 % during the first year following the introduction.
In Spain, 115 people are expected to save their lives every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
However, in order to help implement it, since legislation can be implemented in a normal way, the necessary regulation of criminal provisions requires an amendment to the law.
The facility is not yet available in any sales version on the Spanish market, although it has already been tested in some industrial and public service vehicles.
It is tomorrow that the Congress of Members will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spain Workers' Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 5:40 p.m., as it was in the program, it landed in a presidential hangar at the airport of Benita Juárez in México D. F. a plane of Spanish air force, in which the prince and princess of Asturia arrived.
The sun was just setting, however, its rays still forced their eyes to be closed so as to see the subsequent couple getting off the plane.
There were Spanish ambassadors and other officers under the steps.
A few hours ago, on the street, I asked the cab driver if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming to a state visit.
- Yeah, well, that's great, then it won't be possible to get to the airport to recruit people... she's from here or whatever...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right...
However, the Mexican press knows well who the prince and princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport just outside the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 marine soldiers ready to fire an honest salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit and a princess, very insidiously dressed and with unbroken hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported that in D. F. she is threatened by a storm.
Before they go to the O.R., where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and tirelessly ignore them.
At the door of the hotel, where they will be accommodated, one of the four biggest in the city, awaits a chatty Mexican television reporter.
Best subsidised fashion price
Perhaps there is no more suitable place in the world to announce the fashion price than Paris, and there is probably no better designer and bonvian than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow for the international presentation of new talents in the field of fashion.
The price is subsidised by an amount of EUR 300,000.
Belgian woman Sandra Beani, the winner of the first year, looked at her designs in the window of Manga on the Haussmann Avenue in Paris yesterday and cried almost by milking.
Sure, it's the second largest store in Europe and it's just been opened on an area of 1 335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank designer Valentin for taking up the Presidency of the Competition Jury, led us to have a delicious dinner at the Paris Garnier Opera.
Mango’s solemnly decorated presiding table looked even more amazing than the most significant Chagall’s works.
Nate, who had a heartbroken grief over her brother’s recent death, had put on that brand’s dress, and the jewelry of ELAH, over whom he hid his breath, and hanged in her son Luis — almost a two - foot - elegate — accompanied Valentino at the head of the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took a welcome and, as a true gentleman, stayed with Baron Rothschild without a jacket because they were both offered to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - custom-designed - pants and shirt and changed into long black dress for dinner, took a night walk through the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledová, showed us the ballet exam hall and, in memory of other times, caught one of the bars and suggested "grand plié".
Inés Sastre didn't hold up for a tour of the palace's side buildings, but before she left, she showed us pictures of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked for no scents to be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - Stress number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget about a chaotic and insane everyday life.
And for that to happen, they're all summarised in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm ring every morning at 7 a.m. as punishment, but even worse is to imagine yourself absorbed in a hasty rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called tension and the computer's back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
However, there is neither one or two ways to fight daily exhaustion and to get away from the world of work.
No, it's no bigger than that number and no less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside Yogi position, classical massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book, gathered the whole "men" possibilities, adjusted according to the taste and time options of each individual.
The book is called "1001 method of relaxation" and, thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK, will bring peace to the bookstore.
If anyone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relations, the "guide" denies this view.
In addition, it offers further procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins that rebalance your body, and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Talking From Sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us things that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they're asleep.
When it happens for the first time, it might scare you, but it's actually meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure they told some of you that he was talking from sleep last night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example once a life in high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There's only one reason to explain her onset.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night terrors, enuresis nocturna (night soaking) or sleepwalking, but it does not have to be.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stress situations or an irritable situation.
In any case, this is a little tested phenomenon.
The intensity with which he appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases of great strength, it would be appropriate to observe and consult an expert to see if he has a problem that causes great anxiety and is thus manifested.
We have said that it is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this by bearing in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset a child too much before going to bed.
So search for calm games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
It is possible to use relaxing techniques to help them get some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When the somniloquia appears, try to remain calm.
Remember that she is harmless to the child, and that the next day she will remember nothing.
Useful advice
Don't be him.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you're going to interrupt his sleep.
Even when he's talking, he's sleeping, and so he's resting.
Remember that if you feel a few times that you are very concerned, it would be appropriate to turn to counsel or to find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If it is understood what he says (which is not so usual), avoid the temptation to question him and to draw information from him.
It won't do any good, because when she's sleeping, she's not conscious that she can organize her thoughts.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he thinks, and therefore why he says it, so be very careful how you interpret information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
No fun at all.
That's what's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don't worry, it's not a bad thing, it's just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
After a long, thin period, Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellow-blacks created more chances and managed to turn one of them into a winner.
The game did not have a fast pace during this encounter, in which the attackers were just hard to enforce.
After the first attempt by Captain Kauffmann, who, by a shot from a distance, missed the link, began to have Illhaeusern slightly on top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritating the defense of Dannemaria.
On the other hand, the opponent built a playground in the middle of the field and left only the agile Riahi on the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved to be decisive, first thanks to the two chances of Dannemaria with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which Marais took care of, well situated for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Diebold trial (53).
But the Golman Illhaeuserna did not enjoy the joy for long, he was forced to return to the dressing room after about twelve minutes to leave his teammates weakened.
Dannemarie, however, could not recover from it and the 11 from Illhaeusern, who had only slightly withdrawn to "consolidate" the defense, no longer caused any major difficulties, except for the very last seconds of the game, when the ball flew very close to March after a great confusion.
Sarkozy goes towards angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride over Brittany.
In order to face the demonstration of the power of fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandian ports on Monday morning, the French President decided to go to Guilvinec port in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The last appointed ones have promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit" and hope that "it will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit comes at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen, in order to obtain measures against a sharp increase in oil prices, which reached a peak exceeding an average of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesman of the Elysian Palace, David Martinon, the president will "talk about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and payment of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected with relentlessness by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation called "hlumýžď" in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of congestion.
The holiday port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections in the direction to Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filter dam was opened on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors proved their determination on Monday, when just before dawn the fuel storage of the ports in Brest and Lorient burned tires and pallets, while in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc there were demonstrations.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel of La Manche, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trailers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of the commercial ships.
Fishers from Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique during the evening stopped the blockade of an important refineries Total in Donges.
The ones at Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decide to act on their own until a Wednesday meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" is due to decide how to continue the route and its participation in the forthcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the State Fisheries Department who did not support their movements.
"The boat will continue" because "fishers will not give up" and "will not come to Paris", said, for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Department.
However, professional fishermen who do not pay the oil tax currently pay around 50 cents per litre, consider that the ship's yield threshold is only reached if it is less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman Magnificent
An unforgettable representative of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes, bowed to the legend of the film and politically involved actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
This year, Brazil’s aircraft manufacturer is relying on the delivery of 215 aircraft, despite the threat of a recession that is rising above the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains his assumptions for 2008 with 215 instruments supplied, confirmed by his president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, in particular he takes into account the range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered 41 instruments to Chinese clients in the range of eight years.
AIG is said to be considering transferring 15 % of its assets
The insurer of the American International Group, which was given over water by the U.S. monetary authorities, is considering moving more than 15% of his assets in order to repay the $85 billion that were given to him as a deposit, writes the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to examine the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance on the international field and pension activities in the United States, specifying the journal, which quotes the sources of the ongoing negotiations.
According to France Télécom, the board of directors met on Sunday during the evening to examine the possible assignment.
AIG has not been able to obtain any confirmatory statement.
The assets AIG intends to dispose of include its subsidiary of International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurer of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investment, is provided by France Télécom.
No final decision on these delegations has yet been taken; France Télécom continues.
AIG must quickly get the cash in order to repay the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve Bank at the risk that the US authorities will seize 80% of its capital, thus dilute it to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's bank rescue plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points at 10 365.45 points.
On September 17, 2001, on the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the biggest point decline in its history (684.81 points).
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technological component lost 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points) and settled at 1 98.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points.
Disgruntled since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street literally failed after the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks of the House's representatives, a plan that would allow for a little stability to be found in the markets again.
The 228 votes against and 205 for representatives refused to give Henry Paulson the funds he asked for.
Almost two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent out to the market that sees Congress is unable to accept a certain plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and expressed concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not be "too late".
"If this project is really doomed (...), the relay will immediately be handed over to the Fed (American Central Bank, note red) and to other central banks to remedy the crisis, which would strengthen the credit conditions," pointed out Brian Bethune, Head of Global Insight Economist.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States "every new day brings down one financial institution".
Following the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities of Wachova Bank's bank activity were organised by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly took turns and demanded urgent intervention in favour of the banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that the markets are not dealing with "only the US crisis but with the world crisis," the analyst from FTN Financial added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The income from the 10-year cashier card decreased to 3,632 % compared to 3,827 % on Friday night, the revenue for 30 years to 4.161 % compared to 4,357 % of the previous day.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two White House candidates, the second debate followed, whose task was to find out who from the pair John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The command tents of the Republicans and Democrats campaign were not surprised when they both declared their victory in the television duel, which followed a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "brillant enough" to allow him to stop five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), considers that the Democrat is the winner of the duel.
Among the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner of 39% of the polls, while according to CBS, 25% is the winner of McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his co-founder Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his opponent Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She is gifted," said Bill Clinton on the weekend.
Seventies McCain has consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while stressing the "naivity" of his opponent on issues that constituted the core of the first encounter.
"It seems that Senator Obama did not understand that..." was repeated charges.
"I don't think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
In this spirit of attack, the Republican TV spots have been carried since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head, and he turned out to be brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't understand, while Obama did," he answered a democratic spot this weekend which tells the Republican that he is not sufficiently considering the impact of the crisis on the "normal American".
"During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday before 20,000 people gathered at the election meeting in North Carolina for a heavy rain.
The financial breakdown clearly favours Obama, whom the Americans consider more capable of saving the economy on the edge of the abyss.
"Next week could be a decisive turnout," estimate yesterday's influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
A democratic representative of Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic probabilities" to the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the democratic candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as it was operated by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
The Senator of Illinois reaffirmed that despite the unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to reduce taxes on 95% of Americans, and pointed out that the implementation of the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is its priority number one, together with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain is planning to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided the issues relating to the financial assistance plan 700 billion dollars (€470 billion) which Congress adopted last night, which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice that there were elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night on the main square of the city of Belarus in order to reject in advance the results of the parliamentary elections.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night immediately after the closing of the election rooms on the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of elections to parliament.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "Dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they didn't even go to the elections: "What good would it do if they did what they wanted with my voice anyway," says a young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been favourable to foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian sexes and the freezing of certain assets, could be abolished if the elections are considered to be pure.
The opposition said it wasn't.
"We have been kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been allowed to participate in the census of votes," lamented Yuri Potemkin, spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," stresses Alexandr Milinkievic, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and the leading figure of the pro-European movement, "although it is important to see who sums up the votes, and it is executive power in our country.
If any opposition Members get to Parliament, it will be because they are appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament may mean television, regional meetings and draft laws."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning because " dialogue with the European Union needs to be launched.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is affected by the crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we are threatened to become Russia's protectorate.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, should not declare the election valid.
It stresses that participation appears to be too high and that the general introduction of an early vote (26% of the voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What are you, have you noticed that there have been elections?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no leg in the election rooms.
And there will be up to five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most in line with the regime."
The night silence was once again received by the square of October.
On TV, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on your success.
Interview - Blood that is again certain
Héma-Québec celebrated his tenth anniversary yesterday and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was justly pleased because Héma-Québec became one of the most reliable and efficient blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after a scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated with the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Canadian Government launched a public inquiry, headed by Judge Horace Krever, in order to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to make recommendations not to repeat such a disaster.
While Judge Krever hesitated to submit his report, some provinces put in place a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
The Gélinea Committee held this role in Quebec.
After Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, who was to be run by Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply all the provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Quebec started his activities in 1998, only 38% of the people still had confidence in the Québek blood system," recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was depressing.
With constant efforts to increase the safety of blood products and the continued work in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence," she says, proudly adds, by the beginning of 2008, Héma-Québek trusted almost 94% of the Québek population.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998 Héma-Quebec has applied the principle of prudence.
"At that time, in Europe, we witnessed the occurrence of many human cases of mad cow disease, new variants of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says the woman who has led the society since its establishment in 1998.
"And we had no idea whether this disease could spread through blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of Krever and Gélineau's report that, in the event that we do not know this and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterised by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, it is necessary to take excitable measures.
In April 1999, therefore, we rejected blood from people who have abstained in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely demonstrated that this disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that sticking to the principle of prudence made sense."
In 1999, a much more precise technique appeared on the market for the detection of HIV: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that allow the presence of the virus itself in donor blood, rather than the presence of antibodies on which the tests used previously were based.
NAT tests allowed to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when our blood techniques may reveal the first viruses, explains the specialist.
We managed to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have substantially reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing and without finding out.
These improvements allowed to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood is one out of 12 million today.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Quebec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products every year, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission occurs through a blood product.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe blood transfusions needed to heal," says the head of management of Hém-Quebek.
"The challenge for the next decades is to keep our products safe.
We never know what kind of fertilising element might appear in the system.
Just last year, a virus of chikungunya appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by an insect stab.
We need to be careful constantly," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that Héma-Québec must also count on sufficient supplies in addition to safe supply.
"The needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for a blood donor network, which consists on average of only 3% of the Québecans allowed to donate."
Each healthy person is at least 18 years old, corresponding to admissibility criteria, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people offering blood are not accepted because they are, for example, carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where mud fevers occur, they are excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3% we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Weaknesses are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to how they grow old and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give blood, especially to keep and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unfettered today that we will rarely find an hour to donate blood," Francine Décary writes.
With an annual budget of $297 million Héma-Quebec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eye tubers and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored with Hém-Québek, which also manages a single public blood bank from the cord of Québek.
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, flows blood rich in stem cells that can treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousand-thousand blood sample from the umbilical cord to the bank, and we assume that we will be collecting more than a thousand of them a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," says Dr. Décary, who describes the blood collection program from the cord as very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Quebec does not have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all the hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semifinals
Impact Montréal was qualified for the semifinal round of the first USL division yesterday at Saputo stadium during the second and at the same time the decisive match of the quarterfinal played for the total number of goals, thanks to the victory of 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over Sounders of Seattle.
Subsidiary Antonio Ribeiro gave a decisive goal in the 90th minute game.
After both sides of the goalless first half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, the remaining two goals of the Montreal Formation, were sown.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of Sounders.
Let's remind you that on Friday, during the first of the two quarterfinals, the Impact in Starfire Complex in Tukwila in the suburbs of Seattle suffered a defeat of 2:1.
Impact measures in the semifinals of its power with the Whitecaps of Vancouver.
On Saturday night, at Minnesota, Thunder made up for the 3:1 deficit in his home game, and finally won 4:3, Whitecaps, however, advanced to the semifinal round with a total number of 5:4 goals.
Impact should meet the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be confirmed today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attack trio of Canada is ready to launch the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekance and Andrei Kosticino last night in Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win the Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two assists and Kovalev collected one pass in this fourth victory three-colored of six preparatory matches.
Kovalev ensured victory by giving a single goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said Russian.
"I need another game to make me feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to do too much," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice hand."
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister shall not rule out that by the end of the year he shall call for an early election.
Right after the Convention of the Liberal Party (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's supplementary elections.
"Swipe away the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually intriguing way at the end of the Convention of the Liberal Party of Québek in Levis, without giving any details.
During his speech, pictures were shown behind his back in a painting mill.
On three large canvass ran loops with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Québek from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, just like in the pre-election period.
In fact, at a press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out early elections in the fall, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy program.
The "Plan North" constitutes the fourth dimension of the "vision", which the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, the vision of the "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on labour force, the Convention between Canada and Europe and the Agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - northern territory at 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his statements recently, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "global jewel", but did not mention the term, the level of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At most he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further distributed: particularly hydroelectric power plants, the forest, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
The north, according to Charlest's list, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territorial twice as big as France is with us", "is in Québek.
And it is not only with us, but it is in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he was calling for a certain national founding myth.
Québec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, highlighted the Prime Minister: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he's been adversarially silent to see a huge map behind his back.
The northern, 70% of Québek territory, includes part of Labrador, which has always been requested by Quebec, was specified by the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditional attitude that has repeated all governments so far.
There is one border line that no longer exists for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, in the name of the government I will re-take this position," he pointed out.
Otherwise, "in connection with climate change, it is also necessary to reconsider our vision of the North", he said when he spoke about the North-West transition, which as a result of the melting of glaciers will open year-round.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that the taking of territory is becoming a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the original nations, and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very thoughtful to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially to young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-Pequist MP from Ungava), have already launched negotiations with some 30 communities.
The activity was initiated by the Interministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, where she has an important role as Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a moment when "joint visions will be set".
Indeed, the development of the North should take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Sever plan will be "commonly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a continuous follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"As liberals before us, we have changed our thinking to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
In fact, this was one of the still shattered topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a big cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to baptize Beauharnois headquarters to Adeleard-Godbuta dam.
"From Godbut, founded by Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Peaceful Revolution and Nationalization of Water Electricity, to the Bourass, which created James Bay, our party managed to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he referred to another authority, this time conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When the turn came to the dam hydroelectric power plant Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he said to his member base, causing a lot of applause.
The same Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly not even in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of calling for elections in the autumn of this year, which enables him to do so by law.
However, he stressed that his program was loaded, especially with the mission of the Federal Council in China and the Québec-New York Summit.
The weekend convention provided the leader of liberals with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular a certain "trying to change the constitution" that went very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) demands particularly recognition of the "specificity of Québek" in the Constitution.
He also wishes to appoint a part of the members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council, who would have the right to veto in the case of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, Plan North was accepted sceptically in its main features.
Head of PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois again pulled out the North-Quebeka Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when the Government of Liberals came to power in 2003, it waived the implementation of this policy.
If she had held onto her, "we would have been further today," Marois wrote alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where elections are taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said she would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"However, we wish it not to be a mere theatre," said Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Disgruntled Land
He was Vic Toews, an ex-con of "justice" (irony) in Harper's cabinet, who took the liberty of saying about Louis Arbour in the summer of last year that he represents a "disgrace" for Canada.
In this way, the disgrace of a woman who waged an unfailing struggle for justice, and who deserves all our admiration, tells many of the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government in front of us, which, as the only one of the Western countries involved, has not transferred back to the homeland of its national who is locked up in Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account that, at a time when the acts that were being blamed to him were to be committed, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, even though Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, is denying its word and letting a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one relying on the parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty international and, in particular, the Canadian lawyers are defending Omar Khadra's repatriation so that he can enjoy a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes before torture: little does it care that this young man is now psychologically destroyed, and that is undoubtedly permanent, after so many years of torment.
We do not realize this, but we are witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy" of the word that Harper is holding so much back and which sounds so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morale: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to imprison him according to the wishes of the chief of minority government (as it will be after October 14,...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in the party that proclaims the virtue, the law and the order: they do not see that this government has forsaken what was the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this waiver, not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwell Discuss by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter by Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched prosecutions against three authors and a poor little publishing house for insults in order to create a "transparent public debate" and demands six million.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecutions for insults of honor, but the law.
No surprise Garver is completely missing this crucial resolution.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to hold a public debate to bring anyone to ruin who dares to defend the opposite position?
No matter what happens, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced fight against an army of lawyers supported by almost bottomless pockets of a mining company.
In fact, the tactics in these unbalanced fights often lie in the destruction of the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will clog the mouth of the counter and in addition terrify anyone who dares to pursue this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented the whole matter to the public.
In contrast to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold is active, Canada is a debate under normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas, not in the mornings with a baton.
The mining companies were therefore not enough to open their books, to open their dossiers and to bring about a real debate through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the whole matter.
Barrick Gold, however, does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and smudge reject petitions and letters to support the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver can explain how he can demand a "public debate" and at the same time despise the public's views?
It seems that this word in the vice-president's world only refers to boldly paid lawyers, not all Canadians; that's a rather narrow concept of this term.
In democracy, they have the right to speak with the Nazis.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so mainly because it rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is prepared to listen to Barrick and assess the matter, but based on civilised exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many perceive as prosecutions, in which the defendant's mouth is to be clogged (by the way, as part of its public debate prosecution, Barrick has, by the way, just made an official call to the authors of Noir Canada to officially announce that they should stop using this term...).
If we ignore the surreal Garver's speech, prosecution of the Barrick Gold initiated is a direct attack on the university's freedom of research and the search for the truth that is essential to every democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to quote reliable sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without being subjected to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have been if it followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He's entitled to an answer.
The university that we belong to has been able to manage debates and disagreements since long ago and to resolve conflicts.
The exaggerated Barrick Gold action clearly shows that, despite what it claims, it does not have the slightest desire to hold a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the university world, as it is to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would restrict such an unauthorized prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and the heads of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest rescue economic plan since the great crisis of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, with the help of $700 billion to slow down the financial crisis that has been clouding Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its applications, new mechanisms to ensure that public money is paid, new measures to capture the number of houses confiscated for non-payment, and the right to monitor the level of wages paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
US Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and the Republicans at the table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said the Bush administration representative, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is a crucial point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and the disruption of the American daily life will be enormous," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, negotiations have started to peak from fear of the effect of another failure to deploy investors.
The time limit set was to open the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US president were invited to the negotiations later and both expressed their views on the agreement rather than forgetting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has taken note of the addition of the agreement on certain measures, in particular the aim of which is to enable owners to maintain their residence and the wage arrangements of the state of employment of the rescued companies.
"When we ask the taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate themselves on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on TV waves.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was asked by another station to vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I would love to see the details, but I hope so."
"The gross features I've read show that this is something that we're all going to have to spend and use to move on.
Selecting inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The objective of the 700 billion-dollar plan is to buy out doubtful debts and risk-free and non-sell assets from US financial institutions with the money of taxpayers.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis triggered by the collapse of the real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freeze of cash and in the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
The failure of the first draft agreement last week is a matter for Republican Members.
From the moment the Democrats agreed that for some "toxic" assets of companies having difficulties, the government will only guarantee, but it will not buy them, there is a conviction that the impenetrable situation is overrun.
In order to bring the conflicting views in Congress closer together, measures were put in place to enable the government to introduce new charges that would help it to recover its contribution if, as a result of the programme, it had to take over losses for a period of five years.
The new plan will count on the first 250 billion to which an additional 100 billion could be added if the President considers it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should approve Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire shares in saved companies that, in the event of a profit, will pay him dividends and which he will be able to sell again when it's over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the real estate seizure procedures associated with the loans covered by the plan, as well as setting limits for the amount of evaluation and compensation paid to the managers of the companies affected.
The plan's engineers would like to put it to the vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet clear whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, the vote against this project continued to be raised both in the Republican and democratic camp.
"It is clear that Washington can't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's financial committee, said to the voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money on taxpayers is not the solution."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressmen named "the committee of skeptics", presents the whole matter differently, but the same conclusion occurs.
"Four hundred professors of economics, among them three Nobel Prize winners, wrote: we ask Congress not to rush too quickly and carefully examine which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis was a global crisis.
After the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis Group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitors, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) as a result of the crisis of risk loans to buy properties in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, one of Europe’s 20 largest banks and one of the top ten insurers.
"We will not lose this money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we acquire voting rights in the bank and influence.
And that is what the organizers and households today can appreciate."
On the other hand, on the La Manche channel so far, it seems that the British Government has launched a nationalization of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($75,5 billion) were loans to buy real estate.
According to its notice yesterday, the UK bank’s branches and accounts will be bought by the Spanish bank Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with azure eyes long represented his trump, according to other weaknesses.
Is this American actor emancipated with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensibility, and unfavorable talents that he had, also distanced him from the force category that gives birth to real stars.
But what a long track runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday in 83 years at his ranch in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of bold American cinematography.
Less spectacular than Brando, who had been like him for a long time and was like his rival on the film screen, Newman was a more careful actor, certainly fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the collapse of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother of Hungarian origin.
One of the famous faces of the American dream was born of these European roots.
Without an exaggerated ego, that's the last sign of quality.
Because in it the whole country looked in love with self made mana, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in a battle that in the early 1950s studied acting in Yale, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated a triumph in the theatre, on television and early in the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who placed himself second at a 24 hour race in Le Mans in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, despite the fact that he created a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also go the dark places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the fuss of their own show-business, which will forever remain to some extent mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend made the film lovers dizzy, while his great roles are competing on the black screen of memories.
He's been defining more than half a century of constantly changing American seventh art.
The memory of the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a hot roof, adapting Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From the less ancient past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr Bridge, anxious at an advanced age of marriage, which did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have entered history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a bitter, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me (in the sign of hatred) of Robert Wise, a role designed for James Dean, taken over after his death, which he introduced in 1956 in real knowledge.
Sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting (Sports), Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
The bitter and vengeful pool player in The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same character, will be produced in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which will bring him the only Oscar from seven nominations in 1987.
This face of the wandering ages, it was him.
And him again.
In his career track, different eras compete with each other.
The young know him primarily thanks to the cult Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
The fans met him again in 1994 at the Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
He then concluded his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike a few film legends that left the craft relatively soon, Newman remained in the business for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood with its scraps, pompousness and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, to be "a live challenge underplaying", judging that in his performances he was pushing too hard on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a tray, the profession was not always so gentle.
But the first lovers played less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumpy and desperate, whose fall and rebellion were reflected in his perfect features.
As director of Newman, he revealed the little-known aspects of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence, plays the main role of his wife Joanne Woodward, a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
He gave his son Scott the film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of shame and sadness.
His great friend and former warrior Robert Redford (and played together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly said: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Graciousness, love of life, these are the main qualities of a dead actor.
If we ignore his legendary career, a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opposer of Hollywood bankruptcy also leaves.
His resemblance we were used to seeing on bottles of wine vinegar, sauce, biscuits and other foods, which may have seemed pretty tasteless to us, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his hard childhood foundation.
So, rather than letting himself be famous, Newman was involved in society until the last minute.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the path of life of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced at the Zuschlag & spol. invoice factory?
Soon, October 8th, the trial will begin against János Zuschlag and his companions.
Politicians and their associates are, in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents, accused of fraud committed by a long-term and systematic criminal organisation, resulting in extremely significant damage.
According to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, they often used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and were often fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and the government - in total about 65 million forints - went partly to the cash register of Fiatal Baloldal, partly to individual pockets.
The method that the investigating authority also informed was that the money obtained in public competitions was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration and that the undertakings accepted by the association had never been met.
According to the prosecution, a large part of the invoices were false.
The forms for these invoices came from the Józsefvaro market, the round stamps were produced in Kiskunhalasi.
On the names of which the production of invoices is to take place, the company decided, among other things, on a tour on the northern bank of Balaton, to which Istváno Lados János Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, he was first appointed to see the guesthouses and restaurants.
In them he asked for bills for his consumption, according to which the model was then produced invoices presented in public competitions published, among others, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and the Authority of the Capital City.
Most of the time, István Lados and his companion András , who, according to our information, wrote the most important reports to obtain subsidies.
In his "study path", Lados saw a beer.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, this catering facility for the 90-member group of Biztos Pont was provided.
Yet, according to the manager, so many people would suddenly not fit into this facility.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 by Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was crawling with formal and content errors.
The guest house in Badacsonyttwo had only three rooms, and more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet a hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, the fillers of forms with a rich imagination even when they introduced a company involved in hospitality to the documents - Pigal s. r. o., in which, according to the information provided to the public prosecutor, the documents entitled Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá were not even drawn up.
The head of the company Győző Farkas for hvg.hu stated that when he was summoned to the D.A.'s office to show him invoices, he immediately knew that it was a false document.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the stamp in the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to the formalities, they did not agree that they housed 100 people according to the invoice, because they have only 11 rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, eating was also indicated on the invoice, and their restaurant has been out of operation for a long time.
The zealous invoice producers did not even convince themselves that the visited Budapest Travel Agency was organising only foreign trips and that the invoice with payment in cash, which was also not in line with the company's invoice practice, were foolish to mention as a travel mediating service in Hungary.
In addition, as it appeared during the investigation, VAT was also mentioned in the document, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
The four documents issued to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. disagreed, among other things, with the amount of VAT. The company’s activities were not covered by the above-mentioned 25 % but by 15 % VAT, and the staff of the hotel had only printed invoices, but the invoice produced was written by hand.
In addition, the "issues" of the invoice were spoiled by, for example, stating in one company how it came out due to the investigation of the state's attorney as an activity carried out by the transport of goods by road, which the company founded originally on investment advice did not perform.
The fact that the invoices issued by the Agyütt Foundation and Harmadik Évezredért and the 21st. Shazadi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false, has also been established because of the formal deviations - the inappropriate format of the invoice and the incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or Sports Camp in Kunfehertó, whose representatives denied that they would issue invoices.
For example, counterfeiters did not even notice that HIB s.r.o. from Nyéregyhaza was in liquidation at the time (2001) when a group from Fiatal Városért was on her board, which is why, according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he would issue the paper.
The invoices were consciously exposed
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew that they were to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Eséla Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for approximately four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
The head of the company, Collab s. r. o., had one of Ludovic Györfi accused of issuing a fictitious account according to the prosecution.
Zuschlag and its partners also cooperated with Biogate s.r.o., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied to Jobb Jövőért and Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth approximately five million forints, for which there was no real economic activity.
Even the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which, of course, has already been forgotten by the organisations in their documents.
Another group of billing companies belong to those who had ties to the defendants.
Ivan Kubatov, for example, was a representative of the Ukrainian company Delta Trió s. r. o., involved in the trading of fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, but not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found in the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskun-Halas company Cash Investment s.r.o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian man who was supposed to be handing over documents concerning Ivan Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to Atlasz, Hoppa and the Agyütt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and accepted their consideration.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, the Romanian wallers were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
However, neither of the companies actually worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
However, the companies were beneficial to him because, at the request of a co-indicted lawyer, Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their instruments of incorporation, he issued invoices to the companies Atlas and Y-Generació connected to Zuschlag on behalf of the companies.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The State Prosecutor considered that Kubatov had come to 10 percent of the amounts entered on the invoices and VAT.
To issue fictional invoices, this time to tender for the Biztos Pont association, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006, the Y-Generació and Szövetség and Modern Magyarszágért submitted proposals to the competition of the Mihalye Tancsics Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They received 500,000 forints but did not spend the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order not to reveal this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found during a home tour in the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants are likely to describe the course of production of invoices, as they have already done in the prosecution.
It may be interesting if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything himself.
His statement so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will interpret it in an extensive manner, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying for a large part of the damage, 50 million forints, maybe the socialists have made a deal with him, and Zus will take it upon himself.
In fact, he may have been insulted so far, since his requests for the mitigation of the conditions for his detention, namely that he was put into house arrest, have not yet been heard.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have done much more damage than they have yet to pay, may walk freely or at least wait for the end of their proceedings in their homes to come to an end.
The Psychology of Trucking: Why are we spending more money?
During the auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this famous - and seemingly irrational - behavior has been found by researchers in the field of neurology and economics of the University of New York.
According to their study, published in Science, people do not want to fall behind in the eBay auction, so they will pay too high a price.
Research was using an experimental auction to map the diagram of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers was betting, the other group participated in the live auction, with the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) examined the active brain area of experimental persons.
In both games, the participants could win money, but in the auction game, the important element of which is to overtrust the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to function intensively in losing.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
It is therefore possible, according to the investigators, to explain the attempt to avoid the sharp reaction of striates.
To support their theory, members of the research team of economists carried out a financial cross-sectional investigation.
Under different conditions, three groups auctioned against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the next group were promised that if they come out of the game victoriously, they would receive $15 more for the reward.
On the other hand, the third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost that money.
Thus, the difference between the two groups consisted of all things in the fact that one was highlighted by the victory and the other by the loss.
However, the members of the group who played "anti-lost" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winner" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be derived from any existing economic theory.
These have so far explained the phenomena observed in auctions with the joys of victory and avoiding risk.
Until the neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the conflict between these two theories so that we have now reached a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to find a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people around the world are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is reported among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason is that the sick often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms, there are many similarities, symptomatic of which is hepatitis and jaundice, but the cause of the disease and the disease caused by it is different from one another.
The hepatitis virus is spread in two main ways depending on the cause of the disease: hepatitis A and E digestive tracts (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood and fluid viruses (sperms, vaginal secret, saliva).
In any event, travellers should be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against virus type C.
Signs of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after taking an infected meal, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, an urge to vomiting.
Then the skin and eye whites form jaundice, light stools and darkens urine. Treatment may take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide will die from a more serious type of disease, liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected medically treated.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected with their disease don't even know, the cause of the disease destroys liver cells viciously, and so the first symptoms occur in many cases only 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, implementation of regular depreciation is very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, between drug users and between people with a tattoo.
Currently, the estimated global number of subjects infected with chronic hepatitis C is 200 million.
Since the disease can prove a routine laboratory examination, the person should contact his/her physician if he/she notices any symptoms of unknown origin.
With early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body to prevent infections and prevent cancer.
September 30 is a world day for hepatitis, which was organized for the first time globally by organisations representing the sick in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by these viruses, to the causes of its origin and to the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic that could ease the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examined how faith in the god of perception of pain affects a person, informed the British daily Telegraph.
In a fairly bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while they were all observing the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that carefully examines the human brain, Catholics have also been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating the pain.
Research is the first of a series of research involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The exact test was done so that a sparking instrument was attached to the left hand of the test subject, which was issuing electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to look intently at two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and the Lady with the edge of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain state of godliness to the believers, while Da Vinci’s image was chosen because it did not differ much from the first and acted according to them reassuring impression.
The test subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner, and during that time they received in four consecutive sections of 20 electroshocks, while separately they followed a picture with a religious or general theme.
Catholics reported that they felt "safe" when they looked at the Virgin Mary, as if they were " taken care of" and "relaxed, filled with peace".
They felt less pain than Leonard’s before when they watched a religious picture.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by any highly impressive image even in the atheists, just the right photograph should be found.
"We'd have to find a painting that's going to be very positive, from mother or father's point of view," said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
"Pracicing faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of how much effect a believer would have on regulating the pain of a believer if he showed them some madon from Leonard or a painter like a calibre.
Would the view of the quality of the Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You're what you share.
On his tenth birthday, Google can declare that people can find him in their pockets at least as well as in heaven above their heads; they know where they were on vacation, for which they have been examined and what they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
However, as far as skeptics are concerned, making a parallel to the Orwellian dark vision, these are not the very essence of the site 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently expressed for the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for Google founders to be able to keep their original intention, which was: "Let's organize all the information in the world!"
According to Google, after ten years of worldwide work, the company is only at the outset to work with all the information.
On the question of what will be the next five years, Schmidt answered that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like, "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What kind of work would be useful for me?" - but on such seemingly simple questions, software will not be able to answer until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that the search words and IP addresses are accurately collected during the internet search, and to which pages the interested parties have moved after the search.
Thanks to Personalized Search started two years ago, for example, users can retain their surfing history, look back on what they were looking for and what they were clicking on, so that in a long-term perspective they can generate a finding adapted to them much more directly - the same logic will also be based on Recommendations, through which the system will offer us products and services based on previously mentioned and preserved preferences.
What if my data are used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with? - asks the users who are worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by the company is more severe, the counter-reaction does not cause the internet users to feel guilty, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or even rebellion against power.
However, it is confirmed that all the expressions sought are not only captured, but may also be issued to a third party in justified cases, in such legal cases the rights of internet users are not protected.
The most famous example of recent times was perhaps coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the community site Orkut, established through it.
However, Internet users who are concerned about personality rights could still relax in May when the company's hand in hand with an organisation for the protection of electronic rights of the EFF has successfully proved its truth in disputes with the FBI: Google must not, in the future, be forced by any article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully won nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search terms obtained by referring to the strengthening of the adopted Act on the Protection of Children adopted years ago, but did not manage to obtain lists of searchable items of individual users, or complete lists of websites and key words covering a period of two months.)
The view of Google is so divergent: it is beaten by those who fear the provision of their personal data, because they feel that their intimate spheres and private lives will be exposed to the use of Google services, and are opposed to the revolution that belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild branch, bringing together enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, in it sees a new generation of big business, "the corporation that is now serving", as opposed to his rival Microsoft, considered by Windows the conqueror of the world, however they both fight for the same goals.
This may be because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification code from its users and does not want money from them for its applications; open, free and constantly fresh source of information and software package acts as much more accessible, youthier, "cooler" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this can also be caused by the fact that the geeks understand the very problematic relationship of the Internet and the personality rights, which brought with them just one of the most inclined keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but about cooperation, about the fact that we deliberately leave traces and use the communication channels that we have at our disposal, and although their scope is for everyone else, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can run a profile right on several community pages from Facebook to Xang, which can link to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording the music he listens to, then he can connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and he can write a blog on which to automatically appear his latest photo gallery, which he stores on Flickr or Picase.
At the same time, we can read about a lot of examples of cases from which she will shine: a friend in the morning, looking at the flood of photos of her friends, easily finds out who her crazy friend spent the evening with, or the company can fire a worker just because she shows her sincere opinion about the top management on her blog: one thing is for sure, the concept of private life has been completely re-evaluated today.
The person who lives online life is made up of what he shows, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoids the Google Monopoly, has the option (from the start of ScFimm, which uses Google's search system, but does not deliberately leave a mark).
For example, a small number of people are deliberately not registered on the community website to find them. Online Google application from text editor to photoeditor and the news portal can be replaced for alternative versions that are not connected to the giant server parks and that do not create the best possible profile.
Public opinion doesn't expect much secret when Google shows teeth.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($ 124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising areas threaten the investment of advertising agencies and services launched at a constant rate of speed, making life more difficult not only for Microsoft but also for numerous other software designers.
However, the critical observers also find counterpoints that act as a disturbing impression: for example, the senior management completely rejected the protests of the employees after raising a double fee for the corporate kindergarten, and any frequent daily meals of employees were too expensive, according to the management of the company, but all of this is lost in addition to the fact that Google has already bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and, within the meaning of their agreement, filter out any finding that is contrary to good taste and to the Chinese regime's interests.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when they can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can shift the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project to scan and archive books and magazines is taking such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court, others are terrified of its health system, in which we can build a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database, then it can serve as a good starting material even for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous Cory Doctorow's novel "ScFid" describes the future with Orwellian reminiscences, in which one can approach a person horribly well with the help of Google data only.
The double killer in Odyzd helped to remove the tracks of two juveniles
Two juveniles were interrogated by the police in the case of double homicide in Ozd, and, according to reasonable suspicion, they helped to eliminate the crime, said the spokesperson of the Chief Police Directorate of the County of Borsod on Tuesday.
Persons have confessed to the activity they were suspected of and are currently being accused of assisting a crime.
Both juveniles, according to MTI two girls, are being prosecuted in freedom.
Abetting a criminal offence is punishable by the imprisonment of a period of up to five years.
Suspect of a double homicide in Ozdo, a 23-year-old male here, was taken into interim custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of a pre-planned multiple murders for profitable reasons.
During the investigation, it turned out that a 23 - year - old man owed a greater amount to a 53 - year - old man.
The suspect didn't want to pay off his debt, so he lured his creditor into one of the establishments in Ozdo last Wednesday, where he first killed a man and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, a young man was preparing himself to commit a crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that the murder was committed by a weapon hidden at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a hundred percent stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party despite the fact that the Czechs excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the scope of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the State is the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech Economic Journal E15 writes, the offer of Poles is the highest amount that has been offered to those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech sheets, the offer of the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, New York Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, and Deutsche Börse have been submitted so far.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the end of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by experts on the stock markets at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 % of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with an approximately 25% share, followed by the Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European leaves
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European letters already resemble 'the second of September 11'.
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the President of America, La Repubblica is committing charges against Rome. The President has not even been able to persecute his own party in support of the swiftly paid bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second September.
Also, part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, the world economy has brought an end to the collapse of the lack of political leadership there.
The danger of a collapse of the US financial system is constantly rising, and it will eventually pay the whole world for it.
The Bush plan was not perfect, but after a vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool for dealing with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just as one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be neglected, says the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
So far, individual states can throw a rescue ring to the returning money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy.
But if other banks collapse like dice, there will be no more money, no more improvisation.
In the long term, Member States of the European Union need to move through their national egoism and unite control of fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the remaining money institutions received more than EUR 100 billion, recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which concerns that, like the Americans, European taxpayers will have to reach deep into their pockets in order to resolve the crisis, increasingly realistic.
The European Union has not been seriously concerned with the crisis, which has been rolling on the old continent as a cunami.
The "employees" don't have to wave hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if they were to establish in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers' money to avoid even greater damage.
Smart car mimics the flight of bumblebee
What would possibly be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitating detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
The initial strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC fair, was inspired by engineers from Nissan's company. It was about how to build a new generation of systems to prevent collisions.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan constructed a bio-imimetic robotic control system such as BR23C, a robotized miniauto equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate any collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety package," explained Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General of the brand for Technology PR and Research and Development.
Complex eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see more than 300 degrees in all directions in the visual angle.
To copy the complex eye function, the engineers reached for the idea of a laser remotemeter.
This identifies obstacles up to 2 meters in front of BR23C in the field of view 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation aimed at preventing a collision.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, then the robotized car starts to imitate the movements of the bee and turn the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision instantly changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver is carried out in a completely instinctive way.
"If that were not the case, a robot car could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
They must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology meets the most vulnerable and innermost layer of safety packaging, within which a collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid any more bees.
This process must not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction that the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotational movement, acceleration and slowdown was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium polymer accumulators that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, instinctive, intelligent reactions are important, not the ability to process, but the less storage of data.
This mechanism must only process and respond to several incoming signals per second.
There is no need to store and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, therefore it uses only the memory of a few kilobytes.
He doesn't need memory with giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing technologies for immediate avoidance that, according to Nissan's estimate, could enter serial-produced cars within 10 years.
Another possibility of application may be the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding the roadway of the obstacles, would lead the motorist to the final target set.
Damn dear child already has a name.
The 700 billion dollar bailout package, which is to be divided into several instalments, aims to buy out poor bank loans, is already in writing.
Half the amount will be used in the first round.
Following further negotiations, which ended on Saturday after midnight in the American Eastern Time, Congress officials agreed on a daily debate on the rescue package of $700 billion in total, Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic President of the House of Representatives, according to which only the writing of the agreement remains.
Both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the package compromise.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, stated on the outcome of the compromise: 'The programme will work and will be effective, but further steps must be taken'.
The written form of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. of Washington time (now on Monday at 2 p.m. of Central European Time), but no particular rise on the stock exchanges was caused.
The House of Representatives will vote first on Monday on the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then they welcomed the deal in the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress made at night and we appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
In fact, the programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, in which it was intended to spend a total of $700 billion on the purchase of non-quality mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend up to half the amount of 700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the Congress decides on the matters expected on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will buy mortgage-backed securities, which are assessed as non-quality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special body, which will also be a member of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the next Congress decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can at the same time buy out poor-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and other "toxic" loans.
The buy-back may take place in the framework of the auctions and directly, as communicated by the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance provides them with a guarantee of funds representing a cause of concern, for which the companies will then pay a price equal to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system for up to $700 billion, whether it is a large-scale purchase of bad money, their insurance, or to prevent a systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the large financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, the chiefs of banks, who are in trouble awaiting state aid, can count on the government to reduce their paychecks - which in overseas slang is simply called "a golden parachute".
The limitation of their payouts will occur only in certain cases, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the way of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The limitation basically means that if the Ministry buys in the auction, a tax premium will be imposed on the gold parachutes if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the event of direct buy-back of poor loans, the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that management money is not excessive.
It is necessary to add that the existing Golden Fallout Contracts will not change, the limitation only applies to new contracts, which is to be a further incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first time in American history that there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of general managers," commented the President of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State will retain the right to a share in the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as once the economy and the rescued bank are on their feet, they can also earn money on the transaction.
The draft plan contains that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be recovered from taxpayers.
Of course, there were also voices in relation to the plan of doubt on both sides.
"This is not what the American citizens asked for, because dollars of taxpayers won't protect," said Republican Congressman Darrell Issa of California.
His democratic colleague, Ohio Mary Kaptur, believes that it was precisely those responsible for the Wall Street collapse who insisted on the adoption of the provisions.
Industrial prices increased further
The domestic sales prices in industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 due to the previous month, and then by 12.9 percent in August 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.
The export sales prices in the industry were 1.1 % higher than in July 2008, decreased by 3,9 % year-on-year.
Production prices in industry were, as a result of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month, 0,7 percent higher, up 3.2 percent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by only a minimum of 0.1 percent due to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industries also slightly increased by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The biggest price increase took place in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industries (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the monthly price increase in the bag and saddle products industry by 4.6 per cent, or by 2.5 per cent, respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly price increase in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 percent).
The price reduction occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 percent), the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 percent), as well as, to a minimum, in the wood processing sector (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production and publishing and printing have not changed.
In other industries of the manufacturing industry, we measured a price increase of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector, which has a large domestic weight in domestic sales, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the continued increase in gas prices between 1 July and 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison of domestic sales in the various sectors of the processing industry, prices increased the most in the oil industry (32.4 %).
In the co-operating industry, 13.2%, in the area of the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products with a decisive weight, could be observed, then the 11% increase in prices.
Prices decreased in the textiles and textiles sectors (2.5 percent) and the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 percent).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, the processing industry prices increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water sectors exceeded the prices of the previous year by 18.7 percent.
The highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in the sectors concerned with the production of tangible assets was shown in August according to sector-specific breakdowns.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 %, in the processing energy and further processing sectors, prices did not change due to the previous month.
The biggest price increase in relation to the same month of the previous year was observed in the energy processing and further processing sectors in August 2008 (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods industries, we measured an increase in prices of 6.8 percent, while in the case of tangible assets, a decrease in prices of 1.4 percent.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, with a 12-month comparison falling by 3.9 percent.
Our domestic payment decreased by 1.7 percent over a period of one month, due to the dollar, by 7.1 percent, compared to August 2007 it increased by 7.5 percent and 15.9 percent in relation to the dollar.
Next year, no visa to the United States?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is great hope that around 12 January the American-Hungarian visa-free travel agreement will enter into force, the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "now almost everything depends only on the fact that an electronic system of road clearance and controls will be built on time outside the sea".
At the same time, she pointed out that no entry permit would be included in the new system, but tourists would have to register before they left.
The Hungarian diplomacy representative has been continuing negotiations in Washington since today.
He will meet with the Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order for credit on the Republic of Hungary and will hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for the bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, agreed on Sunday to assure their support to the $700 billion government bailout package, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After a several-day marathon of Congress and the administration, it was announced early on Sunday morning: a basic agreement was made on the bailout package.
The financial package, aimed at overcoming the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are identically referred to as a more suitable candidate for bringing the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, while getting to the forefront of the economic question, Obama again gained a certain advantage, and McCain's lead, which he secured after the Republican convention of Sarah Palin's nomination for vice president.
Obama expressed the hope at the Detroit election meeting on Sunday that the 700 billion-dollar package bill would be adopted quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passages concerning consumer protection, which he also supported.
"We must act immediately, responsibly... to your places, to your savings, to the entire industrial sector, to the stability of the whole economy," he said before the 35,000 crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas of economics obsolete.
McCain explained in an interview provided by ABC TV station: "We'll all be a bit out of line... but there's just no way to do anything."
As the Republican senator said, the proposal includes the establishment of a committee supervising the Minister of Finance and the limitation of severance for the senior representatives he insisted on.
Obama said to CBS that McCain did not have a major role in the negotiations, but he himself was in daily contact with the Minister.
The President of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Overview of German language printing
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it became more confident - so it analyses the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent the Red-Black Coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses in his article "The Bavarian Revolution devours its father" the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, CSU's erosion began a long time before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over its office.
For decades, Christian socialists have restored Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The changeover is the problem of the entire Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel.
The debate was not quite surprising for CSU, but on Saturday a process that could have been expected for almost ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, below 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, i.e. in the period so often mentioned by Stoiber.
The reason for this is the modernisation that CSU has consistently implemented in this country and is devouring its parents.
The sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong at a pace. However, secularization, educational results, the settlement of the Germans from the east and north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not be without consequences of the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is linked to the growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political implications.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more head-on.
It is also obvious that in recent weeks CSU has been the most remote of the classic civic classes; people in the free profession, tradesmen, graduates and university education.
That's how CSU's support is down to 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Vienna daily deals with the confused internal political situation arising from the Austrian elections in its article entitled "Who Who?
He wishes to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits interference of SPÖ into its internal affairs.
BZÖ seems to be open to all negotiations, the greens do not yet agree on a coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties did not have much insight into their cards.
The president, SPÖ Werner Faymann, confirmed that he wished to deal with ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some federal countries and in the social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine the coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was overruled for every fall.
The repetition of this direction is not to be taken into account.
Molterer responded carefully to red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition, or enters the coalition, is so far completely open, these questions must be discussed definitely within the ÖVP.
The President of BZÖ Jörg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
"In order to prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibility," said Haider.
Jaroková: Breaking the enchanted circle of poverty and segregation
In Paris today, the European Summit on Equality, which is hosted by France, the current President of the European Union.
Livia Járóková, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the professional debate in her message to the plenary, turned attention to the segregation in education, as this is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
The Summit was launched - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The negotiations were held between invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Group of MEPs, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that is taking place in the recruitment of labour, Romani people are being pushed out of the European labour market primarily because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and, as a result of poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher level of education."
She further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, the awareness of these contexts in the widest circles - between both Roma and non-Roma children is needed.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the more likely he will become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise duties, they contribute to the national budget.
"The right of their citizenship of the European Union is the right to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their not-so-quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the Member, the cohesion of the European Union with an emphasis on the objective and action to speed up school desegregation processes immediately is essential, and it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations are properly respected.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment; it is necessary to give Roma children the opportunity of a democratic space so that they can participate in the future of Europe as citizens of law," said Járóková.
Everyone is guaranteed by the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities' objective of the European Summit of Equality, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, by providing a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and eliminate discrimination set out at the level of Europe as a whole and of individual Member States.
CSU: temporary pardon
The fate of Huber-Beckstein will be decided by the end of October
Despite the shameful electoral debate, the debate on personal issues has so far been postponed by CSU in Bavaria.
The chairman of the party Erwin Huber and Earth Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their seats, the question is, when will this grace last.
The final October weekend of the Party's extraordinary congress will be decided by the fate of tandem, who suffered a catastrophic 17% vote loss.
In any case, the members of the very criticised duo were told that they would not cling to their posts with all their strength.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of absolute majority, demanded a day after the "Bavor Cunami" to produce personal consequences.
Five years ago - the truth, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, standing at the top of her career - gained 60.7 percent of the Christian-Social Union, now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent of her power.
In Bavaria, CSU has been a "self-governant" for 46 years, producing 18 percent of German GDP.
Conservatives continue to have a high status for the Hungarian economy in the southern Federal Land, but will in any event be forced to coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of a reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of a narrow intelligence team who will launch a poll on the possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, respectively with a right-oriented group of Free Voters, will also be the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be a possible successor of Huber.
It is irony of fate that Gabriela Pauli, whose appearance against Stoiber used the duo Huber-Beckstein to perform the coup, then, with an ambitious municipal politician, made an unmercifully short process.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, the active role will also be played to Stoiber, who has so far been spinning threads from the background, the former Prime Minister of the country, and the former President of the CSU called September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber spent several nagging notes on the address of the CDU, according to him they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
CSU's other politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor if CSU, which played a major role in the national success in 2005, does not put common forces on its feet.
According to Merkel, who was hardly hiding her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: it will not be easier to treat an injured CSU and the social democrat crisis will continue.
The SPD reached 18.6 percent of the weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
In the Sunday elections, not one member of the opposition came to the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), by the illegalities that occurred in the summation of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election.
Although the 110-member legislative body of the 10 million countries lacked the opposition for ten years, the opposition, united under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before the elections yesterday, seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who, following a change in the constitution in the elections with the debated course in 2006, had a fourth reinstated his presidential mandate, this time "lets" appear in Parliament with several opposition Members.
The ODS has dropped even from the boycott that was previously considered.
In the background of the opposition expectation, it was that Russia's increasingly economically dependent Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of the ever-increasing Russian gas imports, took up credit and contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, a company owned by gas pipelines passing through the country, got into Russian hands - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment evaluated as anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians did not receive entry permits.
The release earlier pointed out that the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, put emphasis on positive shifts and not on shortcomings - for example, the ban on candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's Monday flash report had already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not, in principle, appear in the press, especially in view of the fact that the opposition could not be present with a census of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners were released to freedom, and Minsk was willing to go to smaller confrontations with Moscow when it continued to refuse to recognise from Georgia the severed South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Belarus is a union state, has considered these two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said our letter, Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remain so, even though "the power has been too afraid to go into the meaningless parliament of a single member of the opposition".
In view of the results, the opposition does not plan protests, rather tries to deliver its message to the voters on the need for economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with this, of course, and we have to print the opposition sheets in Russia, but distribution puts obstacles to local authorities, but I can see that the change is supporting more and more people, even among the elders," said Milinevich, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security as its greatest success, does not consider the most officially supported layer of pensioners to be the right or the most supported.
"For the debt of the country and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security 'involves the silence of the cemetery' collapses," Milinevich says.
Unlike opposition policy, Russian election observers considered the elections democratic.
The Head of Mission of the Community of Independent States, Sergei Lebedev, the Russian intelligence agency Ria Novosti, said that "people do not believe words but actions", so that the absence of the opposition is nothing more than evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It's the first time in the history of Chigi Palace that a rotating door was introduced when employees arrived and left.
However, as of today, this new measure will start to work against sly people, against those who inject themselves and then go for coffee at work.
The novel against the lazy was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidential Council, Maurem Masi.
"The rotating door - says Brunetta - is an instrument for better work, higher performance, more presences and more services" states the Minister.
"A new period of responsibility and transparency is now being opened.
It is reformism", points out Brunetta.
With Chigi Palace, we will complete the implementation in all the Council Presidency buildings.
For Masi, "the choice of the turning door is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections from the staff, assures the secretary-general: 'It was a joint procedure with the staff and cooperation of all'.
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "there's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning."

in Rome, the Minister will finally announce that in three months the absence of public workers for the disease decreased by 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people per year at work."
And adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"their wage dynamics – explained the minister – have doubled over the last 8-10 years in terms of the private sector and is much higher than inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have gathered to reject Brunett's decree in accordance with the Codacons-supported application.
"While the Minister of Public Administration will present today the figures relating to lower absence of work due to illness – writes the consumer protection association – the nation of 'emergency' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered together to declare war against the illegitimate standards contained in the decree."
Taru will be protested mainly against the exclusion of sickness allowances, which depends on the activity; the extension of the period in which the sick person can be checked within the time limit within which control visits will be carried out, and against the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day 2,500 job accidents happen in Italy, three people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
Inail values confirm that in 2007 we have approximately 1.200 deaths as a result of accidents at work.
These values show the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, causing almost twice the death rate compared to homicides.
In order to regain the attention of institutions, social and information resources about this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating today in all Italian regions the 58th day of the accident victims of work set out on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data extended by Anmile and the same tragic reports of these days confirm how important the issue of occupational safety is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in the report sent to President Anmila, the National Association for Mutilated and Invalids for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his admiration for the constant joint effort to protect workers in the workplace, to protect the injured, to help the families of the victims, and to share public opinion."
"Insurrected 'enraged' was naturally raised, honestly shared in the face of tragedies, which, by their extent, provoke a stir in the media and public opinion, but the everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repeating in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives put forward in the field of education are of particular importance so that young people facing the world of work become more aware.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up on its worrying social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed, for his part, that "as a result of the death of an accident at work creates an absolute critical social state, as he insults the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to stop this situation."
"As for the dates of the accidents at work, it seems that they show a positive turnout, but this does not deny that the number of deaths caused by the accident at work is either way alarming," said President Anmil Pietro Mercandelli again.
"We would not just want this "reduction effort" to lead to less attention, because at the very moment when attention stops, the tragedy begins.
"We believe that in general it is not enough to stop the accident problem and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion, to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, right from school age."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and public participation.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility by employers towards the phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social phenomenon. "
Finally, Mercandelli stated that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of the right to compensation envisaged for the work victims and the "decommission of the support care" to which the system was reached in recent years."
"The goal is therefore to return the guarantee to the employee – he added – because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on the spontaneousness or giving time to the legislator."
MP3 players accused, putting their ears at risk
Listen to loud music for a long time and use portable Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to today's European Commission notice, which in one official report extended in Brussels quotes the views of the Committee on Health Risks that have recently emerged and been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"This scientific opinion – we read in the notes – shows that 5-10% of those who have listened to music for at least five years using portable musical instruments, more than an hour a week, and maintain a high volume device, risk permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that so many young people who use frequently portable music instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an incorrigible way" admits Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – the leader continues – give rise to a clear risk and need to be responded quickly.
The most important thing is that we must stimulate consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding, so that they become fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists – closed by Executive Officer Eu – confirm the need to be concerned, and now the European Commission will examine, together with the other members and parties that have raised the problem, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, the cause of which are portable musical instruments and similar devices".
At present, there is a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music instruments to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by over-exposure of similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damage by looking for solutions such as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In his conviction, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that users of portable music instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, will exceed the current limits corresponding to maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for a long time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should apply to 5-10% of users of such devices, and the number of such devices can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will leave the Commission open for the future of the capital
Today we start, we close in March, we'll have the money in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogliem to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracall baths.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the commission will draw up a handbook for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councilman Gianni Alemann in June.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas – it wants to emphasise Alemanno – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political judges left by Giunta e the General Council.
This is not about any exchange of functions, but just about trying to have some place to process a big project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then dissolved, because this institution must have an exact time frame.
In June, the mayor announces, we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
To him who accuses the Commission of unnecessaryness, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanna will answer: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of quality, as are the proposals of the Attali Commission, and I am sure of that in Rome, her contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics breaks down on everyday problems and on the urgency that comes from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to emphasise that 'this Commission is neither a useless enterprise nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, the Roman citizens will not cost the euro, and will serve to think and involve the best intelligence the capital has'.
For Alemann, basically, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither to be definitive nor immobilized, in order to allow our city an authentic rise at the level that it needs, and to think with a united spirit of its future."
The future, which states the mayor of Rome "will not only be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status the capital, but also "will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy by his decisions and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
Attacks against Obama are growing just as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on the Web: "This man is full of ambitions.
But Obama is insolent: he thinks he can get to the highest post of a nation that had all two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these attacks do not say much"; they are attacks of racial origin and do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then we have surveys; everyone says Obama will win and with a great lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the trunk of the South of the United States, wrote a commentary: at least once in the electoral booth, we know who the American patriot will give his vote to.
One side of the American mentality will come to light, which has remained busy until the last minute.
Tell us what you want, we'll take care of it ourselves, who to check out, whether Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, seems almost certain success of a black candidate.
But despite all this thought for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1500 people: What mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became most of the Bush's weakness.
Whoever takes Georgia W's place will have to perform a huge task.
The U.S. economic collapse was felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers, and many accuse the Internet, "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption about the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questionnaires did not openly say that they have less concern about credibility.
He doesn't feel as isolated as he used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is the crisis of the destroyed economic model.
Besides, cuts made in newsroom, in a room where editors work to put together newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists, this is a problem that needs to be addressed if we do not want traditional journalism to change substantially as the general public understands it.
The American journalist is a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors are convinced that the newspaper is going the wrong way on a national scale.
In the local area, the power group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the website is going.
Larger publishers make their way to the Internet, which many view as "killer" press.
"Economic pressure", which journalists point out, has increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred questioned journalists admitted that they were resorting to technology in the hope of doing something good for their newspaper.
The biggest gap in American journalism is among those who drive newsrooms – that is, leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value decreases to 23%.
This has something to do with "certainty of work" for someone.
Leaders who think they're going to lose their jobs in three years are at 47% national level.
As far as the press is concerned, they're moving at 30%.
As for the "security of work" regarding the staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still in daily order.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In a nation such as Usa, with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, tv and the internet, employers often offer what they want, so the question is to take or leave.
The leaders receive almost always huge salaries, and the editor can make up even ten thousand dollars a month outside of paying pensions and insurance.
As far as the permitted ones are concerned, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year up to the age of 15 days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within one year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: Judgement in Rome, Danilo COPPOLa remains in GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the use of real estate entrepreneurs Daniel Coppola, who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-sale offer of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he was released from house arrest last week, which was converted into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real estate entrepreneur could change his place of residence from a rural town to a capital city.
However, according to the court, this move (which he expressed himself against) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuse him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon appeared a few days ago when the Representant Chamber voted against the $700 billion rescue plan presented by the White House: a large number of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times yesterday, which inform us that the current crisis will tear the Republican Party apart, increasingly divided between its old soul, the East Coast, a milder, more conducive to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, is conservative, hostile to the " Washington" and the world of finance, strong mainly in the countries in the middle and south..
A soul that showed arrogance with the vote I spoke about at the beginning.
This very thing, however, is a mere example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake has already shown: not only in the United States, but in the whole of the West and maybe not just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, this crisis seems to work as an accelerant of the phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, which have been tightening up in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the refurbishment, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the double category of State-power in relation to a certain renationalization of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a banking crisis for financial institutions, which, of course, have strong bonds abroad, but where, above all, the budgets of people and families living in a single country are most affected in the single state.
This has also created a political problem for those who manage it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families, who are also voters.
In short, the crisis seems economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be far from the game or that it has nothing to add: the obvious proof has been given by the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot decide for one common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: when we get into distress, only states have economic resources, a number of financial resources to be able to try to put everything right.
It also owns the necessary resources and powers to use them: two sources of enormous value, under certain circumstances where no market and no international organisation will ever be able to have such a share.
This new emphasis, which the crisis places on a state-national element, is, in fact, in full compliance with the growing importance, which is trying to attach the latest economic progress to one factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered into the kingdom of the sieve, increasingly sophisticated technology, intangible, while we were convinced that global finance had already been destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to deal more and more with such little intangible things as water, grain, oil.
All the things that would have been said can be transported from one place to the other, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to the bounded space, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler, I'm sure has more cards up his sleeve than who he is and who has the bad luck of living in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I'm getting to the second news, which, however, predicts a break.
Those who talk about territory, state, government, inevitably talk about politics, that is, leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, it seems that two convergent phenomena are being created.
On the one hand, the awareness that there is objectively a need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone who can handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit against existing leaders, especially economic ones, which have proved equally incompatible and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, disturbing: discredit, impatience, incompetence, and absence, which is trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that there is an increasing number of beliefs in the broad masses of the population than that their actions should be the same as the ideas of still popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the real sense of the word, that the elite has already overcome its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply feeds on one branch from the underground, but a strong movement to eliminate ruling classes and traditional political arrangements is manifested in sudden electoral "defences" or unexpected changes in collective moods in the last and most recent period, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorland to the fall of the Labourists in the UK, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremony, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have ever greater problems to understand, i.e. to represent, which, not since today, is created in the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is once again strengthening, growing, potentially too cloudy.
Before that, it would be exaggerated to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion".
But I'm sure we can't say it means keeping your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on walls
To overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centres, and now a team of four institutes very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep a 100-pound body glued to the vertical wall using a label of only 2.5 square cm.
STUDIUM – The American Science magazine has published the discoveries of some of the University’s researchers in Dayton, Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials already existing that use a specific structure of carbon called carbon dwarf tubes.
«The base of glue can be imagined as a series of pipes laid down as an arranged pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the gecko legs covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to secure a perfect grip.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles and, at the same time, simply disintegrates from the wall» explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering of Dayton University.
COME FROM HERE? -"This material could be useful as a temporary glue» adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers think of much less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because Dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
For now, no super heroes.
FURTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkley, California, is also researching new glue.
In one article of the magazine American Chemical Society, California’s scientists introduced glue formed from microfibres as hair, which is cleaned from dust by motion to surface to keep the perfect adhering.
Medicines: never with juices
Watch out for grep, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are mainly consumed during the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their consumption is changing, or their effectiveness is reduced with serious health consequences.
In order for David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario, London, to highlight the risks of juice both finished and fresh in combination with some drugs, the current 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia raises a new alarm: just one glass of grep, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some life-saving medicines, to cancel their beneficial effects and to expose patients to health risks.
Grape juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the toxic effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
HAZARDS IN RISK – The Italian medical agency itself announced this in the information bulletin two years ago and encouraged doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink when they take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NEJEN GraPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
Long list of effects amplified by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the challenge of Michele Caruba, director of the Pharmacology Department of the State University in Milan: "This kind of appearances are immediately notified to various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative notes of the medicines you get and if you encounter something vague, do not be alarmed, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» stressed the expert for Ansa.
Nobel for economics Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokeňan who teaches at the University of Priceton, a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics regarding the foreign, economic and political steps of the Bush administration.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, on the days when Enron crashed, Krugman predicted in one comment published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in the sense of the consequences on the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
A prediction that caused few polemics, which for years was blamed to him, but which proved to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked at the rate of collapse such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public interest, said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a 'economic of great importance', but also a popularist who has'a very aggressive style, especially critical of Bush’s excesses liberalist administration».
Open Office, we have here the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source personal production, which is aimed at penetrating more and more users, from household to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the known Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of volunteers, controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with various new features: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window will be added another, far more important, as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
The emphasis is also placed on cooperation with the Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the document with a new Microsoft file (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as allowing to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for transmission by electronic means, or the possibility to transfer the PDF folder to the graphic design model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create documents of "PDF hybrids", which are similar to the typical Adobe format graphics and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet processor or a text program.
Cooperation is an element that has gained many improvements within application programs: it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes; in the text program, one colour is assigned to each co-worker for comments to make it clearer in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on the transfer of some of Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks they should transform the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which is located on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the package is as usual also available for the operating system Linux.
The installation cd can also be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the subject of free circulation can be a dragline for home expansion, it is on the business area of Open Office that a lot of stakes can be placed, and it can already count on various projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are also offers of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet that goes to replace Excel; Impress for presentation similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, in the end, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that by today we are almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this figure can be overcome.
Kohl's results are also positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: it is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the team Gerolsteiner, third-classified and winner of the top-class t-shirt.
The report was quoted by the pages of the L'Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth-year-old racer to Cer, the third-generation era, after the Italians Riccard Riccò and Leonard Piepol and the Germans to Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples belong to those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabras.
If the control analysis confirms the positive on Cer, Austrians will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the identified two years of disqualification.
The report on the positiveness of Kohl at the Third Generation Epo confirms the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed about the outcome of the Austrian government.
26-year-old Austrian was placed in the title of Spanish champion Carlos Saster and American Cadel Evans, and he also won the spotted T-shirt of the best chief.
IMIGRANTI:NEW YORK TIMES ALSO, IS IT ITALY A RASIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants, only in the last house has turned into a priority target of immigrants" with resistance.
It turns a beautiful country into a nation of racists, so it asks in a long article of the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and started with the case of young Abdul William Guibre originating from Burkina Faso, killed in Milan last month because he stole a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times define as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are also the ones where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by the Legou, which seeks to hold back immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of a changing climate in Italy.
The tendency highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedette XVI in Quininale, asked the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism".
Students with expensive rents - up to EUR 900 per room
The market for renting for university students does not know the crisis.
According to Sunia's recent research, the tenants' unions, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that the entire class of students has lost their right to study because of overall too high prices that their families would have to endure – explains the manager of the Sunia studio office, Laura Mariani – in this city, the large demand from students has deformed the market in such a way that it stimulated the rise in prices, which was also growing to residents."
In most cases, rental offers include several offences: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without limited rent, associated subcontracting.
Exceptional intervention is needed for Sunji, which could, through the revision of taxes, regulate prices.
If we look at the details of research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, there is a need for a single bed of about 450 euros, a single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) over a mean value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zones) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room of about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones close to the university, it is necessary to make 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome, in central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 double bed.
Values are a little lower (€550 per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
We save only if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples there is 300/450 euro per bed, from 400 to 600 euro per room, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want 250/350 Euros per bed, at least 350 per single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is the rental for students from countries outside the European Union, there is finally another anomaly: an increase of approximately 25-30% of the fee they want from foreign students compared to Italian students.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities are cancelling the historical halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favour of Multiplex.
"The city without cinemas is blind, it's like a face without eyes."
The painting offered by director Giusepp Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian urban centres as well as rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multisales in the suburbs and the subsequent demise of monosalas in central city zones is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the features of real cultural crime.
Often, historical places filled with memories disappear,"it's like if we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a little bit of travel and a lot of emotions», the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that he won to Tornator Oscar 20 years ago and a great jury prize in Cannes, and who told the poetry of a rural cinema and sadness over a way of life that probably lost the cinema forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, are clear: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional tip closed doors, and the highest account has been paid mainly by halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torina, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with a loss of 82 cinema halls followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsibility for their disappearance is the onset of multiplex are these three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
«Italian progress has evolved unrationally» claims Paolo Protti, President of Anec,"it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that those already existing survive because when one cinema closes in the city, not all of its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about insufficient funding for the fund to the benefit of operators: the previous government debt is approximately EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is shameful that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed».
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closures, which decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first such type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historical centers and suburbs.
Among the planned standards are steps of tax relief for operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter a restricted transport zone and will have special prices to stop and some parking spaces.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that the other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to be able to oppose the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and growing up, was a spark that convinced me to start the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of Rialt or Quirinal in Nazionale Street, where I shared so many emotions that I don't have to look at the inscriptions blackened with dust, I turn to the other side».
The connection between politics and the mafia group 'andranghet, Mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the elections of the city office according to the interests of the Mob Piromalli Group".
The accusations that the Office against the Mob in Calabria have brought against the mayor and vice mayor Gioie Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosari Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarna Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mob, are severe.
In handcuffs also Gioachino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson's lawyer, the nominee of the boss, who has already been accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to the payment of EUR 10 million.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as common sense", writes the prosecutors when two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay a consultation to Advocate Piromalli.
"This would allow the mafia group – the judges writes – to officially enter the city authorities and make it easier for the already huge possibilities of control and public administration."
The president of the Calabrian Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised crime underworld are a lot: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'andangheta, heroes who are still undefiled'.
Prisoners from this morning follow the incarceration from July last year by which the police have shown that the Piromalli mob group has received a final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason for which was the supposed connection between organised crime and local administration - local politicians were deprived of office in municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, President of Christian Democrats, who at the moment of dissolution was elected head of the coalition of the right center after a narrower election in May.
He screamed about the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called for the responsibility of the Deputy Minister of Interior, Marc Minniti, and accused him that he had planned everything for political reasons, but the judges in the incarcerated order signed this morning explain that the Mob has even grown so far that it has requested a change in the A3 motorway project.
From further interviews against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors wrote, "the willingness to move the claims of an entrepreneur, a representative of some larger group very close, as is well known, to Piromalli and to adapt the elections of public administration to the interests of the Mob."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones enter the game.
It's an infinite bearing that covers more than 70% of the earth's surface, and now it's being discovered by large world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the sight of the Colossians, such as Chevron, is now trying to reach out to these sources.
The ability to generate energy from the sea's movements has been studied for more than a hundred years and research has intensified in the context of the first oil crisis in the 1970s.
When oil prices dropped around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away, but now the environmental organisations and a new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that about 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
this quantity would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centres.
In addition, there are currents and tides and tides.
Giants attack.
The company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, who in 2005 agreed to build installations in northern Portugal.
When this was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, there are more and more companies betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies," said a spokesman of a company that is connected to the United States' oil colossus, in the economic daily Wall Street Journal newspaper, and is thinking about working with us."
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining authorisation from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of the offshore energy project in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that oil is still being mined, and President Bush recently came up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the amount invested so far, although not well known, shows increasing interest in observers.
Technology, we need to work out.
Experts talk about technology, which is still in the early stages, because it is not known what the impact of marine energy on the environment will be.
For the time being, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to cause major problems with the ecosystem.
For greater energy production, however, technologies with a greater impact on the core need to be used.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the system fear, which are connected to each other.
The force of the waves, which moves with the buoys up and down, is changed using cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these fights.
Pressure spins the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
Energy reaches the shore of underwater cables.
For now, there are four installations of this type at the project stage, which are only waiting for federal approval and a part of the energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for the shopping center and parking using six Pdo turbines in the New York City East River.
The movement of water during the tide and outflow causes the rotation of turbines, which by this rotating movement feeds the generator.
Verdant commented that they had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisation to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
At this point, the potential of the tide and the tide deserves special interest, they call it the Institute for Electric Energy Research.
Although it is an unrelated factor, the tide and the tide are more predictable than the wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It is in the energy of the tide and the tide of countries like New York, Maine and Alaska, with other coastal states that have already invested $7 and a half million in 2008, and have predicted investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
