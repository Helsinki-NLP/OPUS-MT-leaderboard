Members of the Welsh Assembly fear that they will “look like Mupeti”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are consterned by the proposal that their title should be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The proposal is based on plans to change the name of the assembly to the Velš Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the title could be a mockery.
A member of the Labour Party stated that his group is afraid that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
A member on the side of Plaid said that the group as a whole was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative stated that his group approached a change in the name “with an open mind”, but noted that MWP was close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced like the letter "u" in York English.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now preparing legislation for the implementation of the name changes, stated: "The final decision on what members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be on the members themselves."
The law of the Welsh Government of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public meeting on proposals where broad support was given to the option of calling the Velš Parliament Assembly.
As regards the title of members of the assembly, the committee preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the greatest support in the public debate.
The members of the assembly are apparently proposing alternative options, but the fight for consensus can bring concern to President Elin Jones, who is to submit a draft legislation within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules for disqualification of members and a proposal for a system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will vote on their title in the context of the discussion of new legislation.
Macedonians will vote on a change in the name of the country
On Sunday, the voters will decide whether the name of their country will be changed to "Northern Macedonia".
Any vote should resolve decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a right to Greek territory and repeatedly protest against applications for EU and NATO membership.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia, who is opposed to plebiscite about changing his name, said he would not follow the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's keep quiet because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
“Old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
"There's neither of them today."
The disappearance of the bars is understandable to him.
"People today meet in a different way," he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go."
As for the churches, he fears that money from the sale of assets will not be sufficient for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later, they will be exactly where they started.”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats full of such type of people that do not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” he says, “and that is why the day will soon come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into apartments will become church members.”
Both churches built white congregations before the black metropolis - Metropolitan Community became Harlem in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation whose devotions were held nearby.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who headed the retail boycott on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote black people.
The fire in 1939 heavily damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered a bell-game.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell-game "the bells of the poor".
An expert who played the bell in July called it "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell-ringer, played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell-game in a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, the complicated story of architects and builders has been held at St. Martin's, some of which have been called by lay church representatives, others by episcopal diocese.
In July, the Council of Elders, the head of the parish office, consisting of lay leaders, sent a letter to the Diocese, expressing the concern that the diocese “will try to pass on the costs” to the elders' council, although the hiring of architects and builders who sent the diocese was not involved.
Some parishioners complained about lack of transparency by the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California who was sinking for lobsters.
According to official reports, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was sinking in California for lobsters on the day of the start of the lobster season.
The attack occurred in the morning shortly before 7:00 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the station KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then to him with the whole group paddled to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that the call first considered the joy of the lobster catch, but then “he realized that he was screaming, ‘ He bit me!
Bite me!"
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that “he had a whole area of clavicles torn apart. ”
“I shouted that everyone would go out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’ says Hammel.
The boy was in critical condition transported by helicopter to Council Hospital Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles at the press conference stated that the shark had been seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury at the upper torso.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security.
Giles noted that over 135 sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to stand up to the chains Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic alleys in the style of a department store, where specialized vendors will be available.
In the context of a strong entry into the UK cosmetics market, which is worth £2.8 billion and is growing further, while the sales of fashion and domestic needs are falling, the streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country.
Investment in cosmetics is associated with the efforts of supermarkets to find applications for shelves that have previously been used for television, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's reports that it will double the size of the range of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and will first mention brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also receive existing range from brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees thanks to branded places similar to the ones in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also re-employs its range of boutique makeup, so most of the products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, in two shops Saintsbury’s will be testing the concession retail perfume dealer Fragrance Shop. The first such shop was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London and the next one will be established in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping online and moving towards a daily purchase of small amounts of food in local shops means that supermarkets have to try harder to attract people.
Managing Director of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that stores will look more and more like business houses because the chain of supermarkets is trying to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount sellers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of Argos sales outlets and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are chains that he bought two years ago. Thanks to this increased food sales and acquisitions are so much more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to transform the department with a cosmetic and pharmaceutical range ended unfamiliarly.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after an argument on the distribution of drug sales proceeds in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold his 281 pharmacies three years ago for 125 million pounds to Celesio, which owns the chain of pharmacies Lloyds.
Lloyds is scheduled to play his role by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to the four stores.
Sales Director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks notes: “We have changed the look and style of cosmetics alleys to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers can consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all the needs and the attractive environment, and the favourable location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that changes old shopping methods."
Peter Jones is "frightened" after Holly Willoughby resigned for £11 million
Star of Dragons Day series Peter Jones "crazy" after TV host Holly Willoughby resigned from a $11 million contract with his lifestyle label to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homemade clothing and Truly accessories.
The business of this couple was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
A 37-year-old hostess announced she was leaving for Instagram.
Holly Willoughby was furious with the star of the Dragons Day series Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to information sources, Jones was “crazy” when a TV star, at a tight Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to the new contracts – worth up to £1.5 million – would no longer be able to devote enough time to their brand of domestic clothing and accessories of the Truly.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's actress and could double the wealth of hostess Willoughby in the estimated value of £11 million.
When a 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones went from Britain to one of her summer homes.
Unnamed source states: “Truly’s brand was a top priority for Holly.
It was to be her long-term future, which would secure her for several decades forward.
Her decision to leave was absolutely shocking.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
The Marlow headquarters has a full warehouse of ready-to-sale goods."
Experts believe that the departure of the host of this Morning, which is one of the most high-end British stars, could cost the company millions due to a fat investment in pillow products and candles, clothes and home clothing, and a possible further delay in branding.
And it could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and Dan Baldwin's husband have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and two-year-old Jones joined as Chairman of the Board of Directors in March.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become the M&S Ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin with I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business."
The difficult actions “and then we fell in love”
He made a joke about the criticism he gets from journalists as a comment that some consider to be “unworthy president,” and for how positive he speaks about a North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his ridiculous "voice" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore Trump appreciated as a big step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea, Kim was interested in the next meeting.
But nuclear-weapon negotiations are stuck at a dead end.
Over three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the prominent North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see the "response" for its first steps in disarmament.
Instead, the US continues sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
That would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, according to him, brought positive results – termination of missile tests, assistance in the liberation of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers to the country.
And he defended his unusual access to information on Kim's relationship.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10 000 people from the outside trying to get into this arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” said Trump, pointing out the crowd ahead.
The tsunami waves and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island and killed hundreds of people
In a situation after the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were banished from their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a necessary prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it very clear that they did not require international assistance, so it is a little difficult," Sumbang says.
The Save the Children organization is bringing together a team that will travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel can work here.
The spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutupo, said that Indonesian actors were evaluating the situation in Paul to see if international organisations would be able to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the earth is still unrelentingly unprepared for Mother Nature’s anger.
Although shelters against tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not common on other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of sirens warning Paul of the tsunami has probably contributed to the loss of human lives, even though the warning was issued.
Even in the best time, travel amongst many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that anchored in Lombok and helped earthquake victims is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days for it to get to the place of the new calamity.
The improvement of bad Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and the President spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
Next year, he will seek re-election, but his government suffers from outages in funding.
President Joko also faces pressure from the ongoing sectarian tension in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority adopt a more conservative form of faith.
The street fights between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and tens of thousands of people have driven them out of their homes.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a compensatory goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in 89th minute in London's Stamford Bridge, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters outside Chelsea's gate when his team lost 1-0.
He flipped the ball on his left and fired it to a remote stick.
The shot flew high and headed to the top right corner of the gate.
The ball finally jumped the jumping Kepu Arrizabalag and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible.” said Sturridge server LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming to me, so I didn't think much about it and he shot one touch."
Chelsea in half-time led 1-0 after the goal of the Belgian star Eden Gambling in 25 minutes.
Attacker Blues sent his passport back to Mateo Kovacic, then he turned around in the middle of the field and sprinted to half Liverpool.
Kovacic played the ball fast.
Then he sent the ball down a beautiful alley to Hazard in lime.
He escaped the defense, and left-handedly ended up with a remote pole next to Alison Becker of Liverpool.
On Wednesday, 3:00 p.m., Liverpool in the League of Champions at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy will compete with the local team.
Chelsea will play on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of victims of the tsunami wave in Indonesia has increased to 832
As the Indonesian disaster authority said on Sunday morning, the number of earthquake victims and tsunami waves climbed 832.
The 7.5-degree earthquake struck on Friday, caused waves of up to 6 metres high and imprisoned many people in the ruins of the broken buildings, said Sutopo's spokesperson Purwo Nugroho at the press conference.
Paul’s city, which has more than 380 thousand inhabitants, was destroyed by the ruins of the buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old suspect from stabbing a woman
A female body was found in Birkenauhead this morning in Merseyside, and the police immediately launched a murder investigation.
A woman of 44 years of age with stab wounds was found at 7.55 hours on Grayson Mews on John Street. Based on suspicion of murder, a 32-year-old man was arrested.
The police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something to sign up for.
According to Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan, “the investigation is only at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was moving near John Street in Birkenauhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras might have recorded something to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation,"
Police spokesperson confirmed that a dead woman lived in Birkenauhead, and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The police have informed that the investigation is underway and are now informing the relatives of the victim.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one can go into or out of the building.
When he found out what happened, he wasn't capable of words.
The residents now learned that it will take a few hours for them to return home.
One man was told by a police officer that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
There was a crying woman.
He keeps saying, "That's terrible."
At 14 o'clock, there were two police vans behind the tape, and the others were waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers monitoring the house in a closed area.
Anyone should have any information, can send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and give code 247 of 30 September.
A statue of Cromwell in Parliament has recently become a hit due to a fight over "prescription of history"
His exile would be a well-deserved punishment for his fanatical Puritan followers in the style of the Taliban destroying many of the English cultural and religious artifacts.
But Cromwell Society called Mr Crick's proposal "stupidness" and "trying to rewrite history."
President Cromwell Society John Goldsmith notes: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that one of the goals would also be Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or perform an iconoclasm in English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the acts of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent design of Cromwell, authored by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is proof of the 19th century view and part of the history of the figure, which many think still deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although today somewhat less than in the late 19th century, to defend Parliament from external pressure, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unstoppable historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a well-identified figure that represents one side of this division.
His achievements in the function of Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and reminding."
The killer pig tore up a Chinese farmer
According to local media information, the market in south-eastern China has been attacked and killed by pig farmers.
As South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man with only the surname "Yuan" was found dead with a cut-off artery in a pool of blood near a pig in the market in Liou-pchan-shuej, Kuej-cha province.
A pigs breeder is being prepared to apply the vaccine to pigs in the Porcine on 30 May 2005 in Si-ning, China, in the province of Qinghai.
Reportedly, on Wednesday, he arrived with a cousin from the province of Yun-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the side of the shed was open.
According to him, there was a big pig in the pigs with blood on it.
According to the information, the forensic examination confirmed that he had torn a 250-pound pig farmer.
"The brother had his feet all bloody and torn up," quoted Guiyang Evening News cousin, whom he referred to as "Wu".
The security footage shows Yuan coming to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so that it wouldn't think of anyone else while the police were at the scene collecting evidence.
Market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation with Yuan's family for his death.
Although the attacks of pigs on humans are rare, they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and critically injured a man.
Ten years earlier, 300kg earlier, a pig pushed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and drove him away by a farmer's wife.
After eating his pigs in 2012 by the Oregon farmer, a farmer from Manitoby told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a "starter".
"They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of hurricane Rosa will bring strong rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa, as predicted, is weakening and moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, flooding rains will bring to North Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Time, Rosa reached 137 km/h wind speed, a hurricane category 1, and was 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is under pressure, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and start pushing tropical humidity north into the southwest part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
The tropical humidity, then with the approaching low pressure line in the following days, causes heavy rain in the southwest of the USA.
Precipitation 25 to 100 mm locally causes dangerous floods, suti currents and possible landslides in the desert.
A strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation places to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the USA, especially above the majority of Arizona, precipitation is expected between 50 and 100 mm.
In rapidly worsening conditions, floods may occur due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
Given the danger of tropical precipitation, it would be very unreasonable to take a walk into the desert.
A strong rain can cause canyons to become raging rivers, and storms bring local storms and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure barge will bring strong local collisions on some parts of the coastline of southern California.
There may be a total rainfall of over 13 mm, which could cause smaller sutinous currents and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainfall in this region.
On Sunday night and Monday morning, the unique tropical exaggerations will begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday night and on Tuesday the rain will spread.
On Tuesday the heavy rain will spread to four corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes throughout the United States, because the Arctic is going to cool down, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes at short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the US center on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahou in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa there is a difference of almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit.
In the next few days, they will try again to expand the reaching summer heat.
In most territories in the middle and east of the USA, a warm start of October is expected with temperatures of around 27 °C from the southern plains to the north-east of the USA.
New York City could be 27 degrees C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the US in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation followed over 20 million people
More than 20 million people have been watching on six television channels a Thursday-on-the-quarter bonding statement by a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, and the speakers interrupted the current programs with reports of a sudden Friday turn: the agreement that the Senator mediated for Arizona, Jeff Flake, about the FBI carrying out a one-day investigation into the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate's court committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh would touch her at a high school party drunk and try to undress her dress.
Kavanaugh said in his excited statement that he's 100% sure that it didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen are likely to have followed the event.
The company calculated the average ratings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for the other stations that broadcast statements such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at offices.
For comparison, it's a similar number of viewers who watch football matches in the playoffs or award Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest ratings of all stations when, according to Nielsen, 5.69 million viewers followed him during the day hearing.
The second was ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest remained after the end of the negotiations.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After this moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying that it would vote for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras caught him yelling at him on Friday morning when he was about to take the elevator to the court's hearing.
CNN's been living up to how he stood with his eyes shut for a few minutes, and he had to swear.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard: "You have power, while many women are helpless."
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All the cable and television networks later broadcast live when the jury was to vote on the submission of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the F.B.I.S. was to investigate the charges against the candidate in the next week, which was demanded by a minority of democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by interviews with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's vote was important because it was clear that without an investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of being "politicians" about Brexit
In an interview for the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union that "politicians" regarding the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is arriving at the Birmingham Conservative Party Conference, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was close to the Prime Minister on the front, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to charge each other's duties was "exactly pointless".
Shooting at Waydea Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of the death of a LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in the case of the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
Police department in Baton Rouge reported that Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and arrested on the basis of second-degree murder charges.
The authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses in the match.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to the CBS, the police secured the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to the police, after the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he shot Waydea.
According to the lawyer, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department thanks the police unit for the refugees of the state of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for "driving and pursuing justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-meter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
Last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points to the match.
LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde's death "shocked" and "shocked" him.
"This is what you're always afraid of," Wade said.
The volcano is hurling ashes at Mexico City.
The ashes that roll out of the Popacatépetl volcano hit the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre on Saturday warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the Vulcan activity increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was following a series of riots and shocks.
On social networks, images of windscreens of cars covered with thin layer of ash appeared in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in volcano activity, located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shaken Central Mexico in September 2017 and had a 7,1 degree power.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the vote on independence, the police met the Catalan Separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protesters for independence were confronted with the orderly police and thousands were involved in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence divided by Catalonia.
Police officers blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder after them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists.
Later, the struggles that the police had to use batones to calm down began.
In a matter of hours, groups supporting independence sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in the face of protesting supporters of the Union who called "Let Spain live".
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured at the protests.
A year after the referendum of October 1, which Madrid considers illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate it, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
The voters expressed themselves for independence, most of them, but the vote was low because the opponents of the seclusion boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to put an end to the vote in the electoral rooms in violent clashes across the region.
The groups supporting independence remained outside on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although the demonstration took place, she had to choose another route.
Eighty-six-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer hoped to gain independence for Catalonia.
"Last year, we had one of the best moments.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we're in a dead end," he said.
Despite the important, even though a close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties had to fight to keep things running this year. Many of their most famous leaders either went to exile themselves, or waiting in custody for their participation in the organisation of a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old fitter, recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone, saying that the conflict was made by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming more and more tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting in prison for trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that next year he will run for the European Parliament.
"The candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and repression that we are witnessing by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after a car crash into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were imprisoned after they repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry by car.
The event happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 a.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, someone may have fired a crossbow at the car.
Mengova hit secured Livingston's victory 1-0 over Rangers
First goal of Dolly Mengy for Livingston guaranteed victory
Livingston, who advanced from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and awarded Steven Gerrard only a second defeat of 18 games as the manager of the club from Ibrox.
The hit by Dolly Mengy proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team hasn't won the Premiership championship on the guest field yet, and next Sunday, the first Hearts will be on their way to losing eight points.
Before that, Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston extended a number of games without losing in the division to six games, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced defeat.
Livingston didn't take the chance against the inconspicuous guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal, because his directness caused a lot of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed at the gate, then Alan Lithgow in the slide just missed Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
All they had to do was watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could rub their guests in standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against the Rangers was ordered a free kick and Livingston formed a loophole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent Menga, which the ball in the center of the fine territory flowed and scored.
At this stage the Rangers dominated in holding the ball, but the home defense was impenetrable for them and goalie Liam Kelly usually didn't have much work to do.
The same picture of the game was even in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman stopped Rangers Rangers McGregor and Lithgow from another standard livingston situation.
There were always centers flying into the fine area of Livingston, which the players continued to clean, and two penalty kick came to nothing – after Halkett's attack on Deputy Glenn Middleton and another one by hand.
“Penomén” from Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were outstanding without exception and continue to overcome expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and team have hardly changed since returning to the top, but much praise deserves Holt for the way the team has rebelled since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a great orderly defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert all the time.
Rangers are lacked inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't do that anymore.
Their endgame was poor – only once they penetrated the home side – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up call, because they are located in the middle of a table.
Erdogan had a mixed arrival in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September), the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to correct the relationship between NATO allies.
They did not agree on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and the admission of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
In this city is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people were heard – many of them were Kurds – protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his politics and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
The controversial protests reflect the controversialness of the visitor, which some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
An accident in Deptford: The cyclist died after a car crash
A cyclist died in London after a collision with a car.
An accident occurred at approximately 10:15 local time near the Bestwood Street intersection with the busy Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and soon an ambulance arrived, but the man was dead.
The death occurred only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the scene of the Saturday tragedy in an accident on Childers Street when the driver left the scene.
Metropolitan police have stated that police officers are now trying to identify and inform their relatives.
The road is closed, buses run on the spare routes and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six overseers were injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured during the riots in a male high security prison.
The riots erupted in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and still persist.
Specialized overseers from the Tornado team were called to deal with the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
A prison service spokesman said: “In order to handle the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison workers were deployed.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend a long time behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was announced that the head of the prison ended up in a hospital after the attack.
And last October, an order unit was called to the prison because of the serious riots in which the staff was attacked with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the floods Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where the drought is, can benefit)
It is not customary for Arizona to hit the tropical barge of low pressure, but that is probably what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and brings the risk of flooding.
The national meteorological service has already issued a warning against floods on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday night and bring rain on Monday night.
“ Only ten tropical cyclones have kept the status of a tropical storm or a pressure below since 1950, ” said the National Weather Service in Phoenix on Twitter!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 64 km from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona places up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to drop 25 to 50 mm, with local summaries of up to 100 mm.
For those not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the area has hit the drought.
The floods are a very serious thing, but these rainfalls may help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States just hit dry.
The server weather.com states that according to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 % of Arizona is experiencing at least "extreme drought", which is the second highest category.
The hurricane route Rosa will first lead to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with the maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will be moving at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and thus lose power.
It is expected that they will arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation will be strong, which poses a high risk of flooding.
“In the area from Baja California to Northwestern Sonor, a total rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected, with a potential of up to 250 mm,” says the server weather.com.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm across Mexico north and on Tuesday morning she arrives on the border of Arizona and then passes by Arizona and enters South Utah on Tuesday night.
"It is expected that the main risk to Rosa or her remains will be a very strong collision in Baja California, Northwestern Sonora and the Southwest USA," reports the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause deadly floods and rubble streams in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As reported by the police in Avon and Somerset, young men aged 17 to 20 were detained in the Radstock area at night.
Cops are looking for witnesses who might have a cell phone record of what happened.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "experienced wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the reckless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at the meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump declared that during his nomination process Kavanaugh “experienced wickedness and anger” of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, where he decidedly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her charge.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans were witnesses of Kavanaugh’s greatness and quality and courage.”
He said that "the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh's voice confirms one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has excellent public service."
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it was for Republicans to take part in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't run, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump declared that the Democrats had decided to "resist" and "resist."
The Republican Party’s management adviser told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination on the Senate’s premises is expected at the latest on Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people, and the number of victims is still growing.
The authorities announced on Saturday that after the large earthquakes and tsunami hit Indonesia, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of which swept away the huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On the beach in Palu, on Friday, hundreds of people met at the festival, but at dusk, the coast hit up to six meters of waves that killed many people and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami wave was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people continued to operate on the beach and didn't run away, so they fell for the waves as a victim," said the spokesman of the Indonesian Agency for the Relieving of the BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho disaster at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave didn't go alone, it took cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami wave on the open sea spread at 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
He stated that some people fled from the wave to the trees and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pal.
The aerial photographs that the disaster relief agency has published show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The results shaken the coastal city even on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by Friday's powerful quakes was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped in the Second World War on Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have increased the tsunami wave even further.
Nugroho described the damage as “wide” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found enchanted under the ruins of broken buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of victims and damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Pal, in the area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to him, the communication “was completely paralyzed without any information ” from Donggala.
The Red Cross stated in his statement that there were more than 300,000 people living in the area, adding that his workers and volunteers were heading to the affected places.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse,” says the statement.
The agency was critical on Saturday because it did not know that the tsunami wave hit Pala, although the authorities stated that the waves had come at the time of the warning.
On the amateur footage shared on the social media, it is heard that a man on the upper floor of the building is desperate to warn people on the street of the approaching tsunami.
Within a few minutes the coast will hit the water wall that carries buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the record immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a major power outage that interrupted the communication around Pal, so the authorities could only easily coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still necessarily need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for transport of aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was supposed to visit the evacuation centers in Pal on Saturday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has climbed to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in the city of Paul, where the employees were hiding in shelters from cell buildings built in the yard of the office building, they saw images of destruction, says Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of broken houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When the auxiliary groups launched a sad disaster aid activity, some complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to flow to the place of the calamit when the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," says the spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross, Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says “OK, this is a national disaster,” we can start international aid, but it is not yet.”
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami occurred in Paul, friends and relatives of those who were still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that lighten the gloomy stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the paramedics liberated a woman who was trapped under the rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists on the Asian games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Another one of the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, was his students.
"As a person dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon described how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages through WhatsApp to the contestants from Pal who attended the beach festival.
But his messages ended up with a gray mark instead of a pair of blue ticks.
"I think that means that news has not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while supplementing the ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, the thieves stole 26,750 USD from Brink's employee in addition to the ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in his report, the car driver drained the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to put more money in it.
When he did this, another man “gave away from behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money to be put in an ATM.
According to the press release, several suspects were seen fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
Any information on the identity of suspects shall be communicated to the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: "A being formally known as Kanye West."
Fourty-four-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and he used a pseudonym as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album Yandhi.
In the show they will replace singer Arianu Grande, who cancelled her participation for "feeling reasons", as the creator of the show said.
West had already said that the word for him has religious significance in addition to shortening his current professional name.
“In my opinion, the “ye” is the most used word in the Bible, where it means “you,” the West was heard early this year when he spoke about his album with the radio moderator Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
A number of other famous rappers have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (Brother Love).
Former West's associate, JAY-Z, also alternately wrote with and without the linker and in capital and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the bloody intervention against students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has committed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatellco Plaza that “he would never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
At a time when the left-wing student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers started shooting people at peaceful demonstrations on the square and killed up to 300 people on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those who study and by opening up other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
According to an investor and an artificial intelligence expert, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have published announcements on AI, although the US as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced a plan last year that it wants to be one of the innovations of AI by 2030.
"Doubleing the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are far beyond the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI," Lee says.
Lee said this week in an interview for the CNB that double funding could double the chance that the next major AI discovery would be made in the US.
Lee, who published this month at the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most important AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s he worked on an AI system that overcame the best American player in Othello, and later he was the head of research at Microsoft and the President of a Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated the previous technology competitions of the US government, such as the Robotic Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“Academic tips are not taken away by China, but by corporations,” says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing the best experts from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could help to improve AI efforts.
"I believe that holders of a doctorate in AI should be automatically offered green cards," he says.
The State Council of China has issued a Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the New Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides finance to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Council and other government organizations are giving money to researchers in the USA, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
The U.S. Defence Department established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners from the sector and the academic environment this year, and the White House announced the creation of a Selection Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it now invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
However, the US legislation, which wanted to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has done nothing for months now.
Macedonians vote in a referendum if they want to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name is to be changed to "Northern Macedonia", which would resolve a few decades old dispute with Greece blocking applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a claim to its territory and therefore veto the entry of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott raised doubts as to whether at least 50 % of the voters needed would come forward in order to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: ‘Are you for NATO and EU membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?’
The supporters of the change of name, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price to pay for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, to live freely under the roof of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," says the 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no problems had been reported within 13 hours.
However, the vote was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters finally cast their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voters from the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the Macedonian referendum to change the name that would open the country's journey to NATO and the European Union in Strumice, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and bringing up chairs outside tents built by people who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not the door for the servants," Kavadarkov says.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership of NATO will bring so much necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think that a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
The result of "yes" would be "confirmed by our future".
According to a survey published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute last Monday, a referendum could take part between 30 and 43 percent of the voters – less than the required participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV station revealed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they'd vote yes.
In order to be successful, the referendum must be attended by 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious blow to the politics of the pro-Western government since its onset last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has come for a goal through Brighton's entire defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took out Brighton's defense on Saturday, ensuring Manchester City won 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
His goal at 65 minutes was ridiculously easy when Aguera was given.
Everything began with a pass that the Argentinian assailant got in the middle of the field.
He was pro-printing between three Brighton defensemen, and he got into an open space.
Aguera then surrounded four green sweatpants.
At the edge of Brighton's fine territory, he bypassed one defenseman and a few more.
He found Sterling with his next left pass.
The English assailant knocked the ball in the fine area back to Aguer, who right-handedly overcame Brighton goalie Mathew Ryan with a bullet to the right of the net.
“Aguero has leg problems,” said City Pep Guardiola’s reporters.
"We thought he'd be playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it was.
We were lucky to have scored at that moment."
The initial advantage for Sky Blues in this Premier League match was arranged by Sterling.
This goal went down in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
He sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a remote stick.
Attacker Sky Blues vaulted the ball into the net just before it slipped off the field.
The city will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the League of Champions at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoff fight, there were no many reasons to re-enter.
But the forever competitive Scherzer hopes to stand up on Sunday for the pitcher in a game against Colorado Rockies – only if they have Rockies, who lead in NL West by one match over the Los Angeles Dodgers, hope of a playoff.
Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night by winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
“Even if we’re not playing for anything, we can at least throw it away, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with about the greatest effort I’m going to have this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play it?"
The Nationals haven't reported who's going to start on Sunday, but they say they're leaning to pitch Scherzer in a situation like this.
For Scherzer it would be the 34th start. On Thursday he would train and pitch on Sunday, when he usually has the day off.
The right pitcher of Washington has statistics 18-7 this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump performed at meetings in West Virginia
The President indirectly commented on the situation around his candidate for the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to take part in the elections in the middle of the term of office.
“In November, everything we have done will be at stake.
One of the most important choices of our lives is five weeks.
It's one of the big, big ones – I don't run, but we're still on the move and I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power by whatever means they need, you see the wickedness, the abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to roll over to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats decided to "defence and obstruction".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, saying, "the Democrats are angry and mean and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud buzzing of the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait – that was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse image.
He is intolerant of those who express their views
When the activists of Momento voted in favour of my admonition on my local side, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labourist Members to whom they said they were not welcome – because they honestly said their opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated alike because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, they criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, paradoxically similar issues about which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
Most of the eight years I was a local member of parliament for the Labour Party were GC meetings on Friday night exactly like this.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings are not in progress these days, and the promise of a "kinder, more kinder" politics has long been forgotten if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is examined as to whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the Party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and the colleagues I thought we had similar political views suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and to hold positions that I could not otherwise agree with – whether it be national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and no matter what I say – there is then a tidbit of social network abuse, where they call for my appeal, condemn the politics of the center and tell me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have the respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the influx of sexist or racist insults every day, but who will never give way.
One aspect of this policy era, from which I am most disappointed, is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the diverse flow of opinion, and with every proposal to express distrust or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
Over the last two years, I've been advised many times to stay back, not so much to talk about, and then "I'll be fine."
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, Margaret Thatcher has been provoked by the negligence of the government, which has let my general school class literally fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most – either as a local councillor or government minister.
I've never concealed my politics, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that when a country is breaking through to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not the Momentu in Nottingham, but my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of appeal or political pragmatism will discourage me from acting according to what I think is the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two late fives have a little distorted the final result, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
Now they're at the forefront of the table, like the only invincibles.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and a better use of the chances that helped the domestics to win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been through big trials in our games and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says, "All honor Ayra, they've taken a better chance than we have."
The five Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numbers and Jason Baggot won the unaltered five.
Climo increased the lead of Ayra's penalty and then scored at exactly half-time and turned the solo attempt, so he adjusted it to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and the five Patrick Anderson, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then followed by a longer delay due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on the stretchers, and when he started playing again, Ayr jumped again thanks to Stafford McDowall's five, which he turned Climo.
The alternate captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card and Melrose again used the player thanks to the unaltered Bruce Colvin's five after a short strong pressure.
But the landlords returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking Climate without a ball, MacPherson of the Penalty Order put the ball behind the progressive maul Ayra.
Climo turned, almost from the beginning again, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth housewives.
Star Still Game launches a new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is moving into the hospitality business, and it has been found to be appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
Sixty-five-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, which he writes and in which he plays together with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Two have announced that the coming ninth series will be the final series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the extract from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the report, but the source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to join the “favouring restaurant business” in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are patrolling the sea headquarters of La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
Over public buildings is the blue flag in the color of the ocean.
The sea bases of Lake Titicaca for Amazon are described by the password: “The sea is rightfully ours.
It's our duty to get him."
The entire inland Bolivia is still a lively memory of the coast that the country lost in favour of Chile in the bloody war for resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
These desires may be the greatest in a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the International Court of Justice, which should fall on 1 October after five years of prognosis.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” says the Bolvik diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching MSD decisions on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will decide in favour of the Bolivian claim that, after many decades of intermittent interviews, Chile is obliged to negotiate that Bolivia will provide sovereign access to the sea.
Charismatic indigenous president Bolivia Evo Morales – who has a controversial battle for re-election next year – is also very interested in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that a court will rule in favour of Bolivia – and even if it does, it would not change much.
This UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to anyone and stated that it would not determine the outcome of possible interviews.
The fact that MSD’s decision comes only six months after the last arguments have been made shows that the case “was not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And for the last four years, not only did they not support Bolivia's case, but they may have delayed it.
"The issues of access to the sea were taken over by the current Bolovian government," says Zarate.
He adds that Morales' offensive rhetoric has weakened all the good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will once again act, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
Both countries haven't switched ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were unusually rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with each other’s advantages,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says the nuclear disarmament won't happen unless the US can't trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never arm its nuclear weapons first, unless he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to carry out the promises made at the summit of the leaders of the two rivals in Singapore.
His commentary comes after the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart the nuclear diplomacy that has been stuck at a dead end for more than three months for Singapore meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "hope to the ground" that the ongoing sanctions and objections of the United States against the declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes knock the North to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration unless Pchjongyang takes significant steps to disarm himself first.
Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is general scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about relinquishing this arsenal, which the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris shows that your fashion stores will soon arrive at the latest trend of huge headgear
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy giant headgear for their spring/summer 2019 collection at a show that captured everyone at the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats this summer flooded Instagram and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
The exhibition piece by Valentin was an exaggerating beige hat with a wide edge-like feathers, which flooded the heads of the models.
Other excessively large accessories were decorated with melons, a witch hat and even pineapple – but are not intended to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment with snorkel and glasses, while another one looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with great fashion – you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could come to fashion stores.
Excessive hats come for "La Bomba", a straw with half a metre wide crem, which everyone wore from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded the social media, sent another huge creation to the parade pier – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that carries it.
Dark orange Rafi bag lined with raffia shatters and decorated with white leather handle was a fashionable piece of La Riviera spring/summer 2019 by Jacques at the Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity stylist Luke Army said to FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion shops next summer – since the designer had such a great success with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessively large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic successes, and it continues in 2018 with other excellent test results. Individual and group successes in sports, art, music and other community activities just highlight this.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is representing over 30,000 students throughout Scotland and trying to provide their pupils and parents with the best possible level of service.
Independent schools are preparing their pupils for the next and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement individually adapted school education plans, we observe that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes right to his heart."
It is important to note that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
The latest results of this year's trials show that the languages are first in the tables, with the highest level of success having independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the pupils who learned a foreign language achieved the best grade A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent German students, 69 percent French students and 63 percent Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subjects chosen by pupils are equally esteemed in the study plans of independent and other schools (science, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
The survey carried out by the 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission showed that 17% of the under-lingual skills identified by employers as problems in the occupation of job vacancies are due to lack of language skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
Since more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
With the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person speaking multiple languages will automatically gain an advantage over competition.
According to a survey organised by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them could not speak well enough in a foreign language to conduct a conversation, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, namely 15%, being French.
That is why it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children learn more languages, especially those of emerging economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school is different from the languages it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have a choice of several languages at independent schools with teachers who are experts in the given field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing the educational environment that children prepare and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever they need in the future.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are essential in a global business environment for the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron shows up in the Lakers uniform for the first time in San Diego on Sunday
The fans who are looking forward to the first time LeBron James joins the Los Angeles Lakers will soon be here.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would be playing in the Sunday opening game of the season in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes it takes.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell on Twitter wrote that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week, after practice, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the pre-season.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-seasonal matches," he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, will launch a wave of campaign performances.
It is the first of the five events scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate for a vacant post in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to receive support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in the November elections.
What time does Trump's show start tonight, and how can you follow it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern time, today on Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's Meeting in West Virginia you can follow online below through live transmission to YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about hearing a candidate for Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court hearing this week, and it was very tense because of the accusation of inappropriate sexual behavior, and it is expected that the Senate's confirmation vote will be postponed a week before the FBI's investigation takes place.
But the main goal of this wave of events is to help Republicans take the pace before the November elections.
According to Reuters, campaign organizers say President Trump's aim is to "supply energy for volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority that they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"Control of the Senate is so important for its agenda that the President will go to as many states as possible this busy season," said Reuters, spokesperson of Trump's campaign, who did not wish to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania" could come to today's event in Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, and be watching the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday it will be the second time in the last month Trump will visit West Virginia in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President must come to help him in the polls," says political scientist Simon Haeder, a Westerner University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team has shown its stomach to fight to keep hope from Sunday singles
After three unilateral games, the Saturday couple can be just what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely imaginary sports concept, but the players really believe it, and most of all in such competitions.
So where's the pendulum going now?
"They took six points and now it's four, so we're taking it so that the pendulum is moving a little towards us," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, it leads by four points, and there are 12 left.
As Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in the sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and everyone can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was lethal when moving from the launch to the green, and he's an example.
The famous screams made his bike stronger when he managed to get a key heel to win the whole game when he and Tomas were two-hole behind.
His putt, who won them a game of 15 holes, met with a similar scream that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players left behind.
18 holes to leave a foot.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but adorable couples from Europe are four out of four, and they can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit the hole on Saturday afternoon, but missed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning."
The course and the way in which the energy flows towards and from the stormy audience confirms that these are the players of destination for Sunday's victory, and that by sunset over Le Golf Naitional will not be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best for both of us at the same time in a different hole.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly cooperated with Sergio Garcius, the hero of the morning game with four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The pit and two dabs on the front nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a pit they didn't climb out of.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you anymore.
The games of two pairs on two balls are so fascinating when you closely watch interactions between people in a couple, the advice they get, the advice they don't get, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and by the last day it has taken a significant lead, but this game of two has also shown that the US team has a stomach for a fight that some have doubted, especially from the states.
To the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe scores 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage by the last day of the Ryder Cup then from Saturday's pairing games to two balls came out with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who almost twice won over the Tiger Woods, decided to make four cuts in Le Golf National.
The European party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games on two balls with an American side that failed in series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in fours, won two games, but couldn't get into the deficit.
Jim Furyk needs eight points on Sunday's 12th game to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who after a sensational weekend got the nickname "Molliwood", are only the second couple to win four points from their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After the defeat of Woods and Patrick Reed in the game on two balls and then smoothly beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in a pair game on two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after a two-ball game this morning, returned to Henrik Stenson's partner in a pair of 2&1 defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the number ones and threes in the world ranking.
Europe, however, did not have it on this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris won all over the line.
The triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas broke two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game of two balls and returned later to defeat the pair of Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game of pairs, although two first holes lost.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup the team returns from a four-point deficit to a two-point game, although as a defending Fury side needs only a tie to win the trophy.
After the next day was the best in two days it seems to be the Sunday counterattack behind them.
North Korea says that "no way" will be disarmed unilaterally and without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the ongoing UN sanctions have deepened their distrust of the United States and in such circumstances countries will never give up their nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general assembly that North Korea had adopted "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and rocket tests, disposing of nuclear testing sites and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see an adequate response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “progressive” approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every gradual step, his statement seemed to be significant in not rejecting unilateral deuclearisation just because he had been through this in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed himself to working on the “deuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to formally end the 1950-53 war conflict, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the calls for the release of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US insists on “declaration of the first” and increases the pressure on sanctions to enforce their goals and even object to the “declaration of the end of the war”, said Ri.
“I feel that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem is, however, that the continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted by the American leader at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed the three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the deacclearisation had been a party to this issue and not to the US, the deacclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come into such a stalemate situation."
However, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles on the territory of the United States is inevitable after Mr. Bad President Trump called Kim "a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, at UN Trump, who threatened the “total destruction” of North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm himself, but said that many work must still be done and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is fully denuclearised.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no time frame for this, he said: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue sharply and unstoppably until we are aware of the complete, final, verified denuclarisation"
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to suppress the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missile programmes of Pyongyang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly party and Pompeo stated that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and declared that progress had been made only to be declared by North Korea within a few hours that he was making “gangster demands”.
This month, North Korea committed itself to a meeting with Moon to disassemble the missile site as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "corresponding measures".
He stated that Kim had informed him that the “corresponding measures” he hoped were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and were aimed at normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course to teach them sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year forced all its students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of macho studies throughout the night, when students do not sleep and encourage with caffeine.
The academics found that students at the world's most famous university are often helpless when it comes to basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and female hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the USA.
He was inspired to begin the course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and said, “Why are you telling me this now, in my final year?”
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he said for The Telegraph.
The course, presented for the first time this year, explains to students the basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Medical Services of the University, said the university decided to introduce a course after finding out that students were seriously sleepless during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of student colleges where students click on cups with coffee, curtains, sneakers and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In another part, participants are informed about how long-term sleep depression may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that students’ behaviour will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "study all night" still exists, added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep shortage is increasing.
Enough sleep of good quality should be the "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even so that no gain can occur, because sleep deprivation switches the brain to starvation, so that you are still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler design a course that took one of his classes in Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended that students consider setting the alarm for a time when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can upset your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga sunk Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy's hit confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with the defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox Party tried to record its first victory from February 4 to February 1st at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused only the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from the leading leaders of Ladbrokes Premier Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the half-time and the Rangers lineup seemed without inspiration and determination to balance.
While the Rangers are now falling sixth, Livingston is climbing third and right behind the Hibernian team, as opposed to one goal.
And there could be further problems with the Rangers after having had to be a bar referee of Calum Spence treated with head injury after he was probably hit by an auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side that went around Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who last week picked up the Hearts point and would be happy as his well-trained team strangled its opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have taken hold, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were to score only two minutes after the start when Menga first let Scott Pittman at the goal of Allan McGregor, but the backup buried his big chance.
The far free kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only bite at the back post.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have a penalty for a quarter hour's mark when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson knocked the Colombian challenge off the table.
Rangers managed only two shots on target in the first half, but the former goalie Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by Lassana Coulibala and Ovie Ejaria's short shot.
While Livi's opener could have been against the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it for the hard work.
The Rangers failed again to deal with the deep Jacobs set.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and picked Menga up for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and replaced Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost immediate effect when the wing crashed into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly fought from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into the game of exactly the kind they liked when Lithgow and Halkett metali one long ball after another.
Holt's party could have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran from the corner.
Deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton was entitled to another late sentence when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanach: Geiger Computer Inventor
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, today it is 136 years old, and it is still growing... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Stalician of Geiger Counter then also became a constant pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in the main role of the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in God's name is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of the atoms that are being emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Oh, yeah, he's really banging at it now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
Method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into a laboratory
Then they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers, and then the rivet is injected again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with more than one cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine who taught the immune system to recognise dangerous cells disappeared ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so that they can "see" proteins common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-administered into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “manipulates the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were removed from patients and "taught" them to focus on cancer cells, was already promoted in the treatment of the type of leukaemia.
Kanye West attended a pro-trump sermon, in his maga cap, after his performance at SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was written in Saturday Night Live studio after a confused performance, during which he praised President Donald Trump and said he would run for 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Again cap, he started spitting on the Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say: “How can you like Trump, for he is a racist? ”
If I didn't mind racism, I wouldn't be in America a long time ago," he said.
SNL launched a parody show with Matte Damon in the lead role in which Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court Committee on the rape charge of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the West's theater talk was recorded on the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West.
West also complained to the audience that his head ornaments were pretty eaten from behind the scenes.
“In the backstage, I was being bullyed.
They said, "Don't go in there with the hat."
That's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the wrong place?” and added that he would “put on his Superman suit, because that means that you can’t say what to do.” Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments were only earned by the bubbling of the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL looked offended, embarrassed, says Variety, and one person even said: "The whole studio was completely quiet."
Westa was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing a song I Love disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
The West received support from the head of the TPU Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest characters: Thank you for the fact that you've been the member of the DAVU.”
But the guest talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West “was just who he was, and that is absolutely amazing.”
“But I NECHCI reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “art”) for whom I believe it represents and sends out ideology to the world that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us," she said.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didda, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
A colleague of rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly named Snoop Lion and, of course, the late musical legend of Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game Thrones star Kit Harington has gone into toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy of the HBO series.
An actor, 31 years old, however, stepped out of the stereotype of macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be tough to earn respect.
News The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he believed that "something was wrong" and asked how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #Metoo era.
Kit, who recently married his star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to expressing a strong voice on this problem.
"At this point, I personally feel, quite strongly - what happened so bad with masculinity?" he said.
"What are we teaching a teenage man about the problem we're seeing here?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is taught?
What do boys learn on TV, on the streets, from which they grow the feeling that every man needs to have that side of himself?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?
Because I'm sure a young man's changed something worse.
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel Game of Thrones after the completion of the series, because he already had enough “warms and horses”.
From November, Kit will play in the restored Right West of Sam Shepard, the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose for the best of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the filming of the show, so he gave me my future family and my entire life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in this fantasy show awarded the Emmy Award.
A couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family house in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China shows a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official numbers, more than 820,000 people are affected by this virus.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have been infected with HIV this way has been reduced to almost zero, and Chinese doctors have reported it to a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people a year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is reportedly still widespread.
In view of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection during these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies the fact that the staff would have leaked the information of the GOP senators, the terms “hazardous Lies” and “Conspiracy Theory”
On Saturday, American Member Maxine Waters condemned the claim that a member of her staff had sent personal data to three Republican US senators on wikipages of legislators.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the charges were supported by "ultraveric" scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies," Waters said in her Twitter statement.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for American senators, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday on the Internet and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate's hearing of sexual abuse charges against Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate.
A leak of information occurred sometimes after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address which sources the contributions is linked to Waters' office and published information about the Waters staff, says Hill.
"This unfounded claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised due to these fraudulent and false accusations - was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly earned online criticism, including the one from former press secretary of Ari Fleischer's White House.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she has no temperament to be a member of Congress."
If someone's accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't be repulsive.
They must not question the plaintiff's motives.
He must be calm and not excited."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters with the democratic critics towards Judge Kavanaugh, whom they criticised because he seemed too angry during a Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had drawn attention to “the competent authorities and the authorities involved in criminal proceedings for these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions which are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English again interferes with reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Rexit in every new film with a British tendency, which seems to be the case of this relaunch of Johnny English in a series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this brazen satire on the topic of how clearly bad the nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this incompetent, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to screw things up again in a completely new way - that name more than any other signal that is a wide comedic creation designed for a non-English speaking cinematographic audience.
He is, of course, the dull secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims on smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and a big couscion of that guy who has a single tone in the Chariots of Fire at the Celebratory opening of the 2012 Olympics in London.
The character is also originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, leaving chaos behind.
In this last issue of JES there are one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly zinked about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels pretty undervalued and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is as if it was intended for children rather than adults, and for me, the crazy tramps of Johnny English are as inventive and concentrated as Atkinson's silent film gagas in the person of Mr. Bean.
The current assumption is that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker infiltrated the British super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the horror of an agent in the service - too little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and biased figure who already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays the best possible role of Theresa May, but there is nothing in the script.
Her intelligence advisors will inform her that as soon as every active spy has been compromised, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxurious facility, but also gives record lessons about how to be a secret agent: there are some nice gags here because English offers a spy academy similar to Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his long suffering partner Bough, who was played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the commander of the submarine, an infected figure who may be a little wasted with Vicki Pepperdine's talent.
So Batman and Robin in packing for Her Majesty's secret service, are back in action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale of Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously subject to the charm of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be capable of solving British computer crimes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssey full of frackish patalis: masked as waiters light a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak on Volt's luxury yachts; and English launches a clean anarchy when they try to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volt's house with virtual reality.
All the aces are definitely prepared for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and turbulent it may be, it has something from the children's television.
Kind of a moderate thing.
And just like other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowano Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labourists deny that they would develop a plan for the English to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid in five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to hand over savings to the workers resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would still take the same reward.
Sources argue that this idea would be "useful" for the Party's economic agenda and plan to lean the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changing economies.
A long - term member of the Labour Times said: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It does not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits the parties' attitudes to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not our party's policy, and the party does not take it into account".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a work conference last week to fill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell has stated that he is committed to returning energy from "anonymous directors" and "scientists" in utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders in water companies may not return to their overall share, as the Labour Government could carry out "offs" on the basis of perceived guilt.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees on the board of directors of companies and to create own-owned funds that will transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, said on "60 minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could have changed their mind.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether any Republican senators could push their support.
In an interview from Sunday '60 minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened when the charges came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's decision is, however, unshakeable .
"I've already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it would mean a truly explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it hard," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she named could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival music event will be held in New York, offering a very impressive range of stars and an equally impressive mission at the end of world poverty.
In the seventh year, Global Citizen will welcome tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Converty project, an international group to support poverty ending by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, e-mail to the world leader, phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before he reached his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really the way they convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that by signing an online petition or sending a tweet, they will make a difference?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by his supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and measures of more than 37 billion dollars to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that the funds provided so far have a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the British Investor Partnership and the developers who have committed themselves “to helping children grow into their full potential” promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4 700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, like you, we can only make a remark from social injustice in the form of malnutrition in history,” said the ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman project during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions that called on the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which will address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website asking, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The global citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard journey — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and the movement against apartheid, we will succeed before us because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is one of the performers at this year's New York year's Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy for a "blockage" that would prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent the invasion of Russian energy on the markets, including the Middle East, reveal the U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it acts on the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to channel energy just like in Eastern Europe, in the southern abdomen of Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the opportunity to use our Navy to make sure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organised by the consumer energy alliance, a non-profit group, which in the USA is taken as "the voice of the consumer of energy".
He compared Washington's approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were practically the same.
"The economic potential for Iran and Russia is more or less investment in or replacement of fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-purpose" player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes because Trump's administration is on a mission to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replaced Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step down from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made the Berlin "the hostages" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, worth $11 billion, is a purely economic project to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s eager opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said the Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US has taken a stand from Germany, which reaffirms its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organization, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the third state interfering with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to “look closely at” the 2020 presidential candidacy, says the senator from Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the mid-election elections, she would "look closely" at the President's candidacy.
During a meeting of the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top female position," she said.
"After 6 November, I'll be close to looking at the presidential candidacy."
During the meeting, Warren also mentioned Donald Trump and said that "he leads this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm afraid to death of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren on Twitter said: "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the website published on Thursday showed that most voters of Warren do not think that they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-ranking democratic names discussed in connection with the potential candidacy up to 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Tracka Palin to meet Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being listed in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, may concern other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at the meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "a dream in a room" and said about her son and other war veterans that "others are coming back a little, returning together, returning and asking if there is any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army is giving their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, interfering with the report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in drunkness, said Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Washington Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new measures of the US government that are denying asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 countries and districts in Washington issued a short report on Friday to support asylum seekers and challenge this measure, reported the NBC.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions case, which in August presented the American Civil Liberties Organisation against Federal Policy, was not revealed.
She said that her partner “and his sons and members of the violent gang” abused her, but American officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
Grace-supporting lawyers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing pervasive gang problems and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the US has reversed the decision of the 2014 Board of Appeal, which has enabled illegal immigrants who are fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine, D.C., stated in his statement on Friday that the new measure "is ignoring the decades of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Law requires all applications for asylum to be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said a short friend.
The lawyers further argued briefly that policies that deny the entry of immigrants harm the US economy and say that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and " give the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion," said Sessions in his statement of 11 June.
Asylum has never intended to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Pal, where the number of victims has already doubled, are racing in search of survivors with time.
The situation was getting worse and worse for the survivors.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her hot boy at the evacuation center in a parched city of Pal.
“Every minute an ambulance will bring more bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, choosing through wet things, and trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake were paralyzed.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a spinal fracture and shoulder, were resting at Palu’s military hospital, where patients were treated outside for continued severe post-shock shocks.
The tears filled his eyes when he depicted the feeling that a violent earthquake shaken the hotel room on the fifth floor, sharing a room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save himself.
I think I was dragged into the wall collapse," Haris said for the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard that my wife was calling for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "scanning" propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily, dedicated to the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
The US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday's payment to China Daily in the Des Moines register - the state of the largest sales newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to blend into the US Congress elections on November 6.
Trump's accusations of Beijing trying to interfere in the American elections indicated what the American leaders said that Reuters was a new phase of escalating campaign by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to advertise trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that is manifested at the level of mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, were said by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, American ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China is now doubleding this bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American precious tradition of free expression and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic path, given that the media belong to the “China Communist Party” company, he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish the offer” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans leave their vote before the election because of Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts warn
As many top Republicans defend the candidate for Chief Judge Brett Kavanauga, who is facing several sexual assault charges, the analyst warned that during the upcoming mid-term elections they will get a response, especially from women.
The emotions of this case were extremely high, and most Republicans on the record already say they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) at the last minute's time to pursue an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, Chief Advisor and spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn, newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters were chanting “November is coming!” at a demonstration in the Senate Hall, where Republicans, who are in charge of the Justice Commission, decided to name Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, said Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it was already high, that's true."
However, this could be higher, especially between women's lagging voters in suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age, who do not like the president, but often do not go to the elections."
Even before the public testimony of Ford detailing her sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts proposed that if the Republicans confirmed, the opposition could follow.
"There was a confusion for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, beginning last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote in the committee or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh would sit on the table, it is also about how the Republicans managed it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, the director of the U.S. priorities, the group that helps to vote for the Democrats, pointed out the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in the view of who to trust in the light of the Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more sympathy for the other named.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents have definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent have reported that they certainly or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following pressure from the Flake FBI, he is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh was assaulting her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her her genitalia at the party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new Internet and beat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Open Source Platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the Inrupt project's goal was "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online storage" or Pod.
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and in all at the same time.
What is special about the personal online data repository is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorisation through data."
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to John Bruce’s CEO, to bring resources, processes and corresponding skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the staff working on the project cooperated on the project and the community of voluntary programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in his contribution to the medium published on Saturday that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new website built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the site," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the clergy, which during World War I received the Victorian Cross
Celebrations have taken place for a hundred years since the only spiritual Church of England acquired Victoria's cross as a warrior during World War I.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellengly and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, the sniper killed him and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandchildren revealed a monumental stone to him at the Rushden parade on Saturday.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “genius symbolic” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s victory.
According to London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Colonel Lt Col Vann led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very thick fog and a powerful shooting of field guns and machine guns."
Later, he reached the first line, and with “most courage, ” he led the line forward before he himself threw himself into the firing field and knocked out three separate units.
Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather's actions were “something I could never do but something that was humiliating. ”
Together with their brother Dr. James Vann, the youth group Brentwood Imperial Youth Band laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said that "he felt great honor that he could share in the show" and added that "the rabble of a true hero is manifested by the support of many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but they got Peppa's pig instead.
Imagine that, you've been waiting all night to watch the horny Bellator 206, just to be denied the main event.
The San José bill contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's game, audiences in the UK remained amazed when the news turned into a show about the Pig Peppa.
Some remained unexhilarated after watching for the fight until early morning hours.
One of the Twitter fans described a change in the broadcast for the children's show as "a sure form of bad joke."
"In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m. and it is therefore necessary to broadcast children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication to Bellator after he was asked about this transmission.
"Peppa Little," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said that they would work on the program so that audiences in the UK would be involved in the future.
"I think that when I think about broadcasting, we can probably do it," Cooker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we can't make it on Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, not all of them being friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We will reduce it to five games instead of six – as we normally do – and we have tried to keep the promise to the fans with all our strength and failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “less” because of sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of less value for all because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to go for success.
A 24-year-old athlete stated that until he entered high school he did not realize that “not all of them are like him.”
On the first disc, Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, introduced by Lauren Laverne, said he spoke out loudly about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that because of his ability to become a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-term show Kirsty Young had a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a survivor in Lavern's first program, said that he felt "less valuable" than anyone who grew up with him at the same time because "it was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said: “Up until now, these feelings of inferiority and otherwise were the real things that gave me strength and power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said not to disappoint anyone who might have found out what was going on with his sexuality.
The double holder of the Bronze Olympic Medal became a fighter for the LGBT high profile rights movement and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had heard from him because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and would like to give others "hope".
This three-time world champion stated that he was in love with a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – "has caught unprepared."
Daley married the owner of Oscar, who is 20 years older, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
“If you experience so much at such a young age – he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was not easy to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
Two in June adopted Robert Ray Black Daley's son, and Daley said that "the whole point of view has changed".
"If you asked me last year, it would all be like, "I want to get a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father was not allowed to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him – you won’t be in the first place, Dad,” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The year Daley attended the Olympics in 2012 and won the bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed of it my whole life – jumping in front of our housewives in the Olympic Games, I don't know the feeling better," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – the Proud by Heather Small – which resonated with him at the launch of the Olympics and kept causing goose skin in it.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on a bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson would have reached a record on Sunday when he played the 47th Ryder Cup, but he would have to tune the form to prevent it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the events held every two years for the record of the twelfth, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's four-balls and four-somes on the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the story, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time main winner spent his day alternately between cheerleaders and working on a game in a row that he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, even at the top of his career, so he is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National field where long divided terrain routinely punishes stray missiles.
And if the golf course is not very disturbing in itself, Mickelson is facing the exact British Open Francescu Molinari champion, who won all four of his matches this week on the team with Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans who had four less points had launched 12 separate swords, had escaped the rapid onset, Mickelson's machete could have proved to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man and gave nothing else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, patted me on the back, put his hand around my shoulder and said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He believes in himself so much.
He is a member of the Hall of Salvation, and in the past this week he has been so beneficial to these teams.
I guess I just couldn't imagine him playing two machetes.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson beats Nick Fald's record in most of the West Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson achieved 18 victories, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his team presence has produced some intangible results.
"He is funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people and is a great companion in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players also had fun when they went to see him, this week, which was fun to observe.
He's giving a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big leadership can disappear soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a great lead towards singles in the last few days in the Ryder Cup can easily change to an uncomfortable ride.
Data debuted at a 1997 game in Valderrama, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they got into the finish line with a tight vibrancy 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You must keep in mind that we had a big lead in Valderram, as well as in Brooklin where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only close,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the year 2018 when they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of the team have shown me it's not over.
You'll be bored to death tomorrow.
Get in there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to get that trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I said I'd focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn added: “I could never do it alone.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out with a partner when it goes well, but when you have to be there for yourself, your golfer capacity is fully verified.
That's the message you have to send to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he's got to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will take care of making his players play better as individuals than as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of this big twist when he was part of the winning team in Brooklin to end up a loser when Europe reached the "Medinah Miracle".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players to head for the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but you would like to start as quickly as in Brooklin, as in Medinah.
When this pace goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
According to this, we set up a set-up to make the boys feel like you know how we're supposed to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to counterattack and confront Rory McIlroy in the top match with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole way, Bjorn said about his singles selection.
The German new warship is still postponed
The latest German naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War era, but it will not be available for at least one more year due to faulty systems and snowy coastline, state local media.
The operation of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", a completely new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted the spokesperson of the army.
The ship was to become a part of the Navy in 2014, but the demanding problems after the delivery made the fate of this ambitious project uncomfortable.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will serve as a replacement for the aging fregat of the Bremen class, which the Navy had already ordered in 2007.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-shipment ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies, such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include a long maintenance period – the latest frigates should be possible up to two years outside of home ports.
However, constant delays mean that the top seagoing ships – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas – will be obsolete by the time they put into service, notes the Die Zeit daily.
The illustrious F125 frigate got into the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned a ship of manufacturers after the handover.
Few were known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of fundamental “software errors and metal-based defects” defects that would make the warship useless when deployed into battle.
Software defects have been particularly significant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will operate a crew of 120 sailors – half of the workers who were needed on the Bremen class frets.
It also turned out that the ship has a significant overweight, which reduces its performance and reduces the ability of the Navy to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7 000-ton ship Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as those used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defects on metal elements, the cost of the whole project is also a problem – including the training of the crew.
It is said that out of the original €2.2 billion, the price of EUR 3.1 billion has risen.
Problems with the latest fregats have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, confirmed that the marine army was actually "expiring ships capable of deployment."
This representative claimed that the problems had been continuous because the old ships had been removed from service but no replacements had been provided.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's frigates could become part of the Navy equipment.
The National Trust Organization listens to the secret life of bats
There is a new research on how bats use the landscape to hunt food in the settlement of bats in Scotland.
There is hope that research findings will shed a new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help to manage future activities for the preservation of this species.
The study carried out by the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland association will be followed by bats squealing and the smallest and smallest brown long-eared and watered in the Botanical Garden of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the key areas of this settlement bat, which will monitor the activities of bats throughout the whole season.
Employees and NHS volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
A professional sound analysis of all recordings will find the frequency of bats calling and what species do.
A map of the habitat will then be issued and a message will form a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural resources consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the Habitat are the most important for bats and how species use them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and best practice in maintaining wooded areas for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and all of Britain in the last century are falling to a great extent.
They are threatened by the construction and territorial development that affect colonies and the natural environment.
The risks can also include wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of construction materials as well as attack cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful when they hunt for prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track bugs and obstacles to flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, control of colonies, and sometimes also rescue work.
This organization has even set up the first and only reserved bat reservation in Threave, Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson, head of the estate, says this is the perfect area for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's still too much we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive."
It emphasises the importance of checking bats before the start of maintenance work in real estate, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and cubs, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them, or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put her hand to work and help.
She said: “We have a lot to learn about our bats and many species that we don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo refuses rape charges and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape as "false news" and stated that people "want to see" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, who informed on these charges.
This Portuguese and assailant for Juventus was accused of raping American woman Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Supposedly, he then paid her $375 000 to keep quiet about the case, informing Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the publication of the charges, the 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers in a live Instagram video and referred to the information as "false messages".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-time holder of the Gold Ball in the camera.
"They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are going to charge Der Spiegel with unfounded accusations that they have called "unauthorized announcements of suspicion in the private area".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would require compensation for "moral damage to the level of the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times."
The alleged incident was due in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel suite and the Las Vegas casino.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the game room, where they reportedly raped her, according to the documentation filed at the Clark County District Court District in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo bowed after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent” of the “clad” and “one percent” failed.
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed he paid for the sex, but he was consensual.
Mayorga also stated that she had gone to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "fear of retribution" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking a retrial because she is reportedly still traumatized.
Ronalda bought it for 100 million euros this summer from the famous Italian club Juve, at the time of the attack to Real Madrid from Manchester United.
Brexit: United Kingdom will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “will regret forever” if, after Brexit, it loses its status as a world leader in the production of cars, the secretary for Greg Clark stated.
He added that it was “disturbed” that Toyota UK had informed the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without agreement, it would have temporarily stopped production at Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"The agreement is necessary," said Clark.
The Japanese car company stated that the impact of the delays at the borders in the absence of an agreement on Brexit could be given to the state of employment.
At the Burnaston plant, where Auris and Avensis made Toyota cars, nearly 150 000 cars were produced last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would record a production stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Executive Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car companies, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fear of leaving the EU without agreement as regards the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW states that it will close its factory for the production of Mini cars in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers call the risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on the basis of ‘just in time’ supplies, with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU being delivered to cars manufactured on order within 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom left the EU on 29 March without agreement, there could be border disruptions, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day in the Derbyshire plant at the warehouse, and the company stated, and therefore production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plans to revive future relations with the EU are "accurately calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also grasping this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The proof not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be stopped, but in the long run it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately be at the expense of the jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the trade union, said that the trade union members are becoming increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places are lost, they will never return.
The government spokesman stated: "We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, states the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" because he continued to fight for the position of Supreme Judge with Brett Kavanaugh," said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special council Robert Mueller, who investigates the attacks on the Russian elections, the ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and the possible court obstruction by the president.
Let Trump release the deputy attorney-general and threaten Mueller's independence, the Washington rumors have been full for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed carrying a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, at that time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would not release Rosenstein "the council" but then the meeting was delayed so that she would not interfere with a hearing with the Senate judicial committee where they gave witness statements to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation into Kavanaugh's charges, which delayed the full vote of the Senate again.
Trump's press agent, Sarah Sanders, showed up on the Fox Channel on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, it may be necessary to move another week with regard to everything else that is taking place in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and will always communicate the latest information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference with the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not caused by the aversions to the "divalong" of television reporters, although she said: "I disagree with the fact that they will perform."
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is holding more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she added without stating the evidence. "We looked at the numbers."
The conference will continue, Sanders stated, but “if the press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly have been better than talking to me.
We're trying and you've seen that we've been doing this in the last few weeks and that a press conference will take place where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visitors to the High Representative.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his loose and sometimes bizarre view of the gathered reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman has sent a letter not more than six months before the departure of Great Britain from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to settle the costs of requests for settlement of EU citizens who work in the public services transferred.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “By summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU are continuing at a standstill, and they are heading for the expected decision this autumn.
However, the British Government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible withdrawal scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to assure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit both the patients and the communities to whom we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our warm wish is for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The protracted defenseman Tigers from the State of Tennessee Christion Abercrombie proceeded an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's defeat of 31-27 by opponent Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
State head coach Tennessee Rod Reed told the reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-life.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline and then put him on the stretcher and prepared for further assessment.
The state shareholder in Tennessee told Chris Harris at WSMV, Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that no “no details of the type/range of the injury” are yet available and that the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore in a red shirt, graduated the first season for the State of Tennessee after the transfer from Illinois.
Before the game was finished on Saturday, he had five general procedures, which means a total of 18 procedures in the season.
Foreign merchants will be charged a higher property tax when purchasing properties in the UK
A foreign buyer will be charged a higher property tax when he buys real estate in the UK, and the money will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corby's move to attract young voters
The increase of the higher property tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury is expected to increase £120 million a year – to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate if they buy real estate in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help homeless people, will be announced today by Theresa May.
This action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with a promise to provide affordable accommodation and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in the property tax will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and money will further strengthen government efforts to fight sleeping without a roof over their heads.
The supplement, which is added to the current obligation to pay property purchase tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for the second house and purchase for the purpose of renting, can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury is expected to increase its funding by up to £120 million a year.
The estimates say that the newly built properties in London buy 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of the United Kingdom, which drives away prices and makes it difficult for those who buy for the first time to get on the rankings of houses.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "city of spirits" precisely because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new principles appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called after the property purchase tax was reduced to help more young people to their own first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding property prices high by taking up land, but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to correct “unfriendly houses” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a fascinating series of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the end of "no harm" evictions.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
She said: “I said last year that I wanted to devote my efforts as prime ministers to the restoration of the British dream – so that every new generation would have a better life.
And that means correcting our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and shape life.
It cannot be right, however, to make it easy for those who do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to buy houses as well as hardworking residents of the United Kingdom.
For a lot of people, the dream of their own home is too far away, and the shame of sleeping without a roof over their heads is too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross reports that he is his "highest ambition" to become a manager of Scotland at some point.
42-year-old Scots are looking forward to the resumption of the North-East Club, which currently holds a third position in the First League, just three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved on to the Stadium of Light after last season he managed the St Mirren back league of the Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got rank B and it was," said Ross on BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that attracts me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors in the role of managers of Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he felt no anxiety about the succession of such established names in such a large club when he previously rejected the foreplays by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The success for me at the time would be measured by the question of whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to put him back there, but I guess I'd only be successful if I could get the club back."
Ross has been in charge for only three years, before he worked as auxiliary chief in Dumartin and spent 15 months as coaching Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third group and transformed St Mirren from the beginning of bankruptcy to the champion title winner right in the next season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he ever had in his career players at Clyde, Hartlefool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably the real intersections,” he recalls when he took over Allo.
“I truly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, earning good money and enjoying reasonable heights.
But playing can be challenging.
There's a lot of things you have to go through a week.
I keep going through them in terms of stress and pressure on the job, but I just feel good in the lead.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and I feel like I feel the most in my whole adult life right now."
You can listen to the interview on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
Research found out that a great time for a pint was on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the income of British pubs facing difficulties, but increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
In July, the numbers show that pubs and bars recorded a 2.7 percent increase in sales – but the restaurant incomes decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, who produced the final reports, stated: “The stable sunlight and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, when pub attendance increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were hit even more.
The sales of restaurants decreased by 1.8 percent in June even worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that attract drinks have so far been as powerful as the restaurants have offended.
The pubs whose main sales are of food also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatic as the operators of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between the controlled values and the bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent to a given month, while food sales dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analytical company of leisure activities and hospitality, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chains continue to fight, although the annual sales decrease by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer cannot be a worse time for operators of food companies, and time will tell whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring so much relief."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened restaurants, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, which is an established industrial scale in the sector..
Every fifth child has a secret account on social networks that hides from parents
Every fifth child – at the age of only 11 – has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and teachers, shows research
Research among 20,000 high school students has shown a rise in “false Instagram sites”
Reports have increased the fear that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of the pupils reported having a “main” account that parents know about
Every fifth child, at the age of only 11 years, creates accounts on social networks that hide from their parents.
A survey among 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “false Instagram accounts” in which they share photographs.
Reports show that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the pupils reported having a beautiful “main” account that parents know about, and at the same time have a private account.
One mother, who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, found out that her teenager was admonishing others to "rape her."
Research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of 11-18-year-old students have two profiles, half accepting that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is alarming that he has so many teenagers tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletic committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director at the annual General Meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most appreciated light athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in charge of sport like those for whom she will benefit from far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Communitys, and we are sure that it will be very beneficial for the athletics in Scotland if she is a member of the Committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be truly beneficial and to help lead the sport in Scotland.”
An American who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after a transitory ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “I had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was only time to see if I could get better or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been able to get full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing the exercise today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
Milk suction device that induces the comparison of mothers to cows divides views online
The suction pump company divided online opinions by advertising that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
As part of the launch of "the world's first silent carryable vacuum cleaner" the Envi consumer technology company has released a music video with an exaggeration showing the freedom that the new vacuum gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of haystacks to a song with the lyrics "Yes, I will, but you see no tail" and "In case you haven't noticed that I don't have veggies, my breasts are here."
The congregation continues: "Pump, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, I drink my sweet milk."
However, advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has triggered online controversial reactions.
The video had 77,000 sightings and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of whom reported that it sheds light on the "horors" of the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and give birth to give birth, but children are taken away from them a few days after birth," one of the comments says.
The Elvie is placed discreetly on breast-feeding (Elvia/mother)
Another comment: “Intelligibly traumatic for mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added: "The ad is completely out."
One woman admitted that the song was considered "infectious".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I was still breast-feeding.
I feel just like a cow when I'm suction.
The ad is a little crazy, but it's a big deal.
It is a brilliant product," one user wrote.
Another said: “It’s a fun commercial for mothers who suck milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.
It is not an advertisement to praise or destroy the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all dance with discreet vacuum cleaners hidden under the bra.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the observation that a lot of women who suck milk say they feel like cows.
But Elvia is completely quiet, she has no wires or hoses, and she hides in her breast-feeding bra, so she gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold a child and even to walk while suction.
Ana Balarin, a partner and an ECD for mothers, commented: “The Elvie vacuum cleaner is a revolutionary product that deserves a significant and provocative marketing.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and milking cows, we wanted to point out the suction of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing a fun and reliable incredible sense of freedom that the new vacuum cleaner will provide.
It's not the first time an Elvie vacuum cleaner got into the sun.
During the London fashion week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski appeared on the pier, which the product just used.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
Despite the fact that the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in particular because the hard rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children accompanied.
Most accompanying immigrants were traditionally made up of immigrants without documents who were afraid of threatening to stay in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households had to provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at the Immigration and Customs Department, testified to Congress that the agency arrested hundreds of people who applied for the status of accompaniment of single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested did not have prior criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of those who are sponsors or sponsors’ household members are illegally in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to prosecute them," said Albence.
According to asylum workers, representatives in an effort to process matters more quickly concerning children have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within one month before detention, instead of earlier standard 60 days.
A lot of them appear through videoconferencing calls instead of personally declaring their case legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who, according to their opinion, are not entitled to assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely he will experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to rage or escape attempts, claims asylum workers and reports from the system in the last few months.
The lawyers state that these concerns are increased in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering are most likely unnoticed, precisely because of the size of the device.
They added that moving children to a stable camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or goodbye to friends could cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria has announced that the US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" are to be withdrawn immediately
During the speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called upon the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, even though there is already an eighth year of war in the country.
Moual, who is also the prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "this will be handled accordingly."
"He must surrender immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over, ” with more than 360 000 people perished since 2011, and millions of others lost their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight “in this holy battle until we free all the Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreigners present.”
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria that mainly train and advise the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 units in the war zone.
When handing out refugees by Moual, he declared that the conditions of return were good for them and accused “some Western countries” of “dissemination of irrational fears,” which caused refugees not to return.
"We have spoken out international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"Politicize what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no recovery aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
United Nations diplomats point out that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protection zone in the last refuge of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russia-Turkish Agreement prevented a large attack on the province of Russia by Syrian forces against three million people.
He pointed out, however, that the agreement had a "clear end date" and expressed the hope that the military procedure would be aimed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front organization, with a link to Al-Qaed, who would "be exterminated."
The United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of the new committee, consisting of members of the government and opposition to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections, will soon take place.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "checking the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning against intervention.
Why Trump will win in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would have won in the next elections in 2020 if, as many liberal observers are hoping, the prosecution and scandals of his office as president would not have ceased.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be the most dramatic finale of the presidential period in history!
Until now, there are no signs of surveillance fatigue.
Since 2014, the ratings in main time have doubled more than to 1.05 million to CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million in mainstream time, which is an increase from 1.7 million years ago according to Nielsen and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC, to 3.5 million watching major night news.
“It’s a heat that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the operator of the “Designed Survival” on ABC drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and screenwriter of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked me
"He said, "Because he's funny," said Mrs. Scovell.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Charging is a luxury that only the most privileged followers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you are an informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses "deep backup" resources for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's ostrich leather jackets worth $15,000 ("dressing arrogance" as Washington Post said) and the consequences of Mr Trump Stormy Daniels' disgusting imagery.
I will not look at Super Maria again in the same way.
“Part of what he does and what causes the feeling of reality show is that he feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, Head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of Pawn Stars on a rotating c N.F.L. Trump show, in which he appreciates Kim Jong-una.

When I got in touch with Mr Fleiss this week, it was sunny, outside on the north bank of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was holed up inside, watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court was on his dragonfly.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr Fleiss.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows to the tightest home competitions medium-term elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania after experiencing an inflow of finance thanks to the reorganization of congress districts that generated two office holders in the fight for the same chair.
This has recently led to the transformation of the Pittsburgh suburban Democratic Republic of the Conor Lamb – which acquired another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th precinct of Pennsylvania, which is strongly overlapped with the new 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania issued an opinion in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided for the benefit of the Republicans, the maps were repainted.
The race in the new 17th District initiated a strong financial dispute between the financial branches of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the monitored March special elections to the 18th Congress District.
This chair has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won 20 points in the precinct.
Politicians give the Democrats a slight lead.
America is considering fineing Salvador for China’s support, then retreating
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged Beijing under mild pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was accommodated in a hotel in Panama until the partners judicially moved Trump's organizational team.
Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw the US Directors of the diplomatic mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan,” said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Heather Nauert in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But fines were considered only against Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million of US aid in 2017, including funds to control narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included shortening financial assistance and focusing on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
With the ongoing internal negotiations, North American and Central American leaders postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations in the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the US.
But by mid-September, the leaders explained that they wanted to continue their negotiations and effectively complete any fines considered for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of solving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the signal that the administration is putting forward for the meeting, diplomats have said.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new news from Washington.
Mr Bolton, spokesperson of the White House, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American leaders, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources have been confirmed by an external analyst who is close to government enforcement and has also spoken on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The final nail to the coffin could be the report by Robert Mueller from the special committee on the possible obstruction of Mr Trump in the exercise of the law, which is now a lot of evidence in the public record.
In his investigation, Mr Mueller is allegedly referring to whether Mr Trump's campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia on the attack on our elections.
If there were an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr Trump would have to take responsibility before this body, just as he is preparing to step forward again before the voters, and in the end, he would probably also be expected by a jury composed of his colleagues.
This is a whole series of "if" and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each and every one of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice ahead of us that will affect how much longer the suffering will last.
In 1938, the German officers were prepared to organize a coup against Hitler, only to stand up and support the Western powers in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments, which accelerate or slow down the inflexible functioning of democracy.
The Americans are now facing a few critical moments like this.
What are we going to do if Mr Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, here a man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's had it on since the report announced that he had been secretly recording the president last year and speculating that he was not in a health condition so that he could hold the President's office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inaccurate.
“How do we react if F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested investigation is not complete or fair – or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite compelling sexual assault charges and perjury?
And most importantly, will we vote in mid-term for Congress, which will assign responsibility to Mr Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait a long dark night.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles on a swastika table.
How could I not be an optimist with such an inheritance about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about meeting Rapide Vienna
Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians would give them a great deal of hope for the G group of the European League after an impressive draw in Spain on the Villarreal field earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented the backupist Graham Dorrans from showing up on the course for the first time in the season until 2-2 with Villarreal. However, he believes that the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We went to a fight with faith that we could grab something, and we took the point.
Maybe we could multiply it at the end, but overall, the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better at the first half, but in the second half we got better and we were better.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be hard, because in the last game they played a good game, but I'm sure the audience behind us will be able to push and it'll be fine.
Last year was pretty tough, with all my injuries and changes in the club, but now I have a really good feeling about it.
The team's strong, and the boys are really enjoying it, and training is good, too.
I hope we're up to it now, throw this season behind us, and we'll be successful."
Women are worried about retirement savings
Although the surveyers had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few talked about it with family members.
About half of the people in the national study stated that she had discussed the price of long-term care with her partner.
Only 10% said she talked to her kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not want to discuss it with him," explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare a family to provide care if you do not reveal your wishes to them in advance.
Together with your advisor and family, discuss where and how to take care, because these factors can play a great role in determining the price.
Invite your financial advisor: The advisor can help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Long-term care can, for example, be financed by means of traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance that helps you pay these expenses, or by using your own insurance with your own funds – while you have money.
Create your legal documents: Prevent legal battles while you can.
Select a health care representative, who will be a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that doctors follow your wishes unless you are able to communicate yourself.
Also consider writing down the power of power for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will take financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid in case you are not yourself eligible for it.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your old parent is necessarily in need of a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his drugs and allergies?
Write down these details in your written plan to be ready.
"The game is not just about finance, but for example, what are the names of the treating physicians?" asks Martin.
"Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready to go."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
As communication is out of operation, auxiliary units could not obtain any information from Donggala Regency, a region north of Pal, which is closer to the epicenter of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala after the disaster broke out.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated at 379 800 people in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morali on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian organization Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunami has hit Palu and Donggal several times the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami in Donggale killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
Tsunami struck West Donggala in 1996 when she demanded nine victims.
Indonesia is located on a seismic Pacific Fire Circle and regularly there is an earthquake.
Here's a list of several major earthquakes and the tsunami of the last few years:
2004: The great earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh Province.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and at the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6,8 degree earthquake hit the south of Indonesia’s most populous Java island and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: The 7.5 earthquake hit one of Mentawai's islands, near Sumatra, and caused a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The light earthquake hit Pidie Jay's regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic because it reminded people of the devastating effects of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami has been formed, but more than 100 have died because of falling buildings.
2018: The strong earthquake hit Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaskan governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interference with domestic violence reports and obstruction of arrest.
When, according to the police report, his girlfriend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took Pali's phone.
Palin has been sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held for an unsecured USD 500 bond, reported KTU.
According to a report from the Network, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he felt “decisively innocent” when he was asked to comment.
The fuel faces three Class A offences, which means it could be sentenced to up to USD 250 000 for the year of imprisonment and the fine.
At the same time, he was accused of a class B offense, which was punished by a one-day prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin has to face a criminal announcement.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack on the police has been reported by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently in front of the Alaskan War Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
He supposedly hit his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palinova was criticised in 2016 by groups of war veterans when she associated her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her son's service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi occurred on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks are out of operation, and in the coming days, the number of victims is expected to rise.
The earthquake struck directly on the rubble part of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarty.
Social media shows videos depicting the moment of disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are applying for the death penalty for Sayfull Saipo, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died – a unique punishment that has not been granted for federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly in October, carried out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan with a rented Home Depot truck, which he wiped out pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipo had "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a number of injuries – this is how the conditions of the intention to grant a death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York court.
According to the court documents, both numbers would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the federal attack, the grand jury accused Saipo of 22 criminal offences, including, for example, the murder charges for extortion charges commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and the accusations of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and preparation", claims the plaintiffs and describes the manner in which Saip's act was committed as a disgusting, cruel and twisted."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, pain and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,” she says.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District Court of New York last granted the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually executed in connection with a federal case in New York City in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, who were shown a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs sat in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal regret in court documents during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to the charge, Saipo told the authorities that he was inspired to commit an attack by watching the Islamic State videos on the phone.
The police also reported that they also required the flag of the Islamic State to be posted in a hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “obviously disappointed” in the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and a life sentence without the possibility of being released will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
The Saipo's defense team had already asked the prosecutor not to demand the death penalty.
According to Members of the Conservative Party, it should be entrusted with negotiations on NIGEL FARAGE
During today's protest at the Conservative Party Conference, Nigel Farage committed to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former Head of the United Kingdom Independence Party has stated that politicians must “feel pressure” by Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s own Members suggested – should negotiate with the EU.
A number of conservative MEPs, Peter Bone, on the march in Birmingham, declared that Britain would be already outside, if he were a secretary to Brexit Mr Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May is facing in reconciling her ranks, where there is a deep dissolution, has been highlighted by the conservatives who are fighting for the continuation of the EU, who have joined a stand-alone protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan from the Chequers in the process of undermining the supporters of Brexit, the supporters of the Union and the EU itself.
Allies insist that they continue to try to agree with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force the Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and its 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave group would gather in Solihull where he wanted to “deal the Chequers”.
He proposed to Mr Farage that he be a representative and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was at the forefront, we would already be outside today,” he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: “I will stand behind Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers.”
In order to show his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought World War I so that we have to listen.
In our own country, we want to do our own laws.”
Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is completely wrong."
The conservative supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns, who also participated in the march, told the reporters: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not liked by members of our party, nor by our activists, who are currently filling the streets to be elected at all.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp report to Mrs May, she says, "Ministers will keep their place when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage stated that conservative politicians must “get into an awkward situation” if they wanted to betray their decisions adopted on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
“Now it is about trust between us – people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re standing here today to tell them that we won’t let you.”
In his report, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel pressure.
“We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has given us a victory in the referendum on Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Great Britain, who owns itself.”
While still in the Union, the supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved the Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend's launch.
The Labourist MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives because of the security issues of the party's application after the opening of the conference.
“These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"The whole thing is a farce.
There is nothing like a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to have a full-blown run for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would “rethink the presidential candidacy well. ”
Boston Globe reported that a democrat from Massachusetts talked about her future on Saturday at City Hall in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is attempting a November re-election against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself in the centre of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters at City Hall since Trump sat in office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to apply for the President's office.
Warren said that it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means a woman in the highest place.
He was arrested as a suspect in the shooting of Sims from the LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she arrested a suspect from shooting a LSU Wayd Sims basketball player on Friday.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 Conference ET news.
A video was released from Friday's shooting with a request for identification of a man caught on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot on Friday mornings near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which did not match life," said police commander Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was moving at the crime scene, had a gun, and confessed to the shooting of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was completely covered and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Six feet and six inches tall Sims, which grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, of which 10 were last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton came closer to the title of World Champion when the team directed him into the hands of the victory over Sebastian Vettel
The moment Valtteri Bottas ended up in Saturday's qualification before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team director would play a big part in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the position field, and Hamilton almost got rid of him when he defended his position in the first two turns and called on Vettel to attack a teammate.
Vettel entered the depot first and let Hamilton catch up with the cars circling the group's groin, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider went to the depot a little later, and after the exit, he placed himself behind Vettel. However, Hamilton went forward and in a close combat, the Ferrari rider was reluctant to leave the inner course free to defend himself in the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen left the rear row of the driving field and at the end of the first round was on his 21st birthday in the lead.
He then ran for a large part of the race because he kept the original tires as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and could take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally he went to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight laps he could no longer increase the pace and Raikkonen remained the fourth.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri's been doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and the rewards are the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's meeting for insisting that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford with the accusation of the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court for sexual assault.
During his speech at the meetings in West Virginia, he did not directly mention Ford’s statement to the Senate Judicial Commission, but declared that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “bad and disgusting and lying.”
"One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that has been happening in the Senate for the last few days, when you see the anger when you see those people angry and mean and disgusting and lying," he said.
"If you look at the release and the publication and they tell you, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you responsible for the leak?
Remember her answer... did you post the document - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter to Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the information escaped at the beginning of September – but Feinstein refused to escape from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't even publish the case information," Feinstein said, as he informed The Hill.
"She asked me to keep everything secret, and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
Of course, her words seem to be unfaithful to the president who spoke at the meeting on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this is a really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual harassment, and indicated that the Democrats are using these charges for their own ends.
“They are determined to take power back by any means available.
You see the meanness, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to stomp into the country to get back to power and to the helm," quoted Mediaite's President.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars fixed a Friday loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants winning the Saturday retribution in Dundee, which ended in 5-3.
The Giants soon took the two-man lead thanks to the interventions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to balance the house before Dwyer returned the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard then rebalanced Dundee, and the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen assured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for team Adam Keefe, who succeeded in defeating 2-1 in Belfast Dundee on Friday.
Both teams have met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous games dominated by Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, under Kendalla McFaulla's assistance, while David Rutherford scored an assist at Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got his homemade back into the game at 13:10 p.m. and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cowni, who compared it at 15:16 p.m.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabins for the first break, after all, only in the lead when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The household regrouped and the Bouchards again managed to match the goal of the power play in time 27:37.
The joint work of Cogni and Charles Corcoran later helped Nielsen in the second third of the game to turn the lead on Dundee and the same player insured the leadership of his team in the middle of the final third.
Giants, who have now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play the next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic leader died to allow hundreds of people aboard aircraft to escape earthquakes
Air traffic leader in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he perished when he supervised the aircraft with hundreds of people on board safe to take off.
More than 800 people died, and many are missing after a major earthquake that caused the tsunami on Friday’s Sulawesi.
Strong subsequent quakes flooded the area and many remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that colleagues of the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunavana Agunga fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in a wildly loitering control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He remained in his position to make sure that the flight Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at that time on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower down when he thought he was sliding.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation spokesperson Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, told the television channel Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We've prepared a transport from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, where he was taken to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pal.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities expressed their concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands, and the agency responsible for solving the disaster stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The number of deaths is increasing, because many bodies are still not released under the wreckage and many of them still have not been reached," said the spokesperson of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves in the devastated Palace reached a height of up to six meters. Mass funerals will take place on Sunday.
Both military and civilian aircraft bring assistance and supplies to affected locations.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News Station: “Every minute an ambulance brings more bodies here.
There's a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to that station CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the site.
It's already tragic, but it could be worse."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s military forces: “I am asking you to work day and night and complete all the tasks that are needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" said CNN Station.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that one person is missing after the crash of the aircraft in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight crashed in a lagoon on one of the micronese islands in the Pacific now reported that one person was missing, indicating at the outset that all passengers and crew of 47 were safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini in the press release stated that she was unable to find one passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline reported that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for a missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the requirements for giving details of this passenger, his age or his nationality.
Local ships helped to rescue other passengers and crew after the plane landed in the water when attempting to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the officials claimed that a total of seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the treatment on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
However, what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Air and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some of the Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed at a very small altitude.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further reported that he and the others managed to get water through the belt deep into the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He also stated that the cabin crew panicked and screamed and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors, who worked nearby on the port pier modifications, helped rescue with an inflatable boat that carried passengers to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with the PNG registration mark, but no accident has occurred to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution ended its speech on Saturday in this case in which a man is repeatedly tried to burn a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The US Department of Justice in the person of his analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours and provided expert assessments in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury analyst outlined a script using the cell phone records of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he had obtained localisation data from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was in the evening of her death at Chambers, which was contrary to his previous statement, said The Clarion Ledger.
When data from a cell phone showed that he spent the night with Chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then the police visited him.
Sanford was brought before the court of the council and testified that the day in question was not in town.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that "he was lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis reported knowing Chambers about two weeks from the day she died.
However, mobile phone records indicate that the two knew each other only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis erased Chambers' text messages, phone calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it completely from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the case to be brought before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about this genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed band from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and solving social problems.
So they want to go back to the roots and re-populate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have already met with recovery in recent years thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black girl?!
The teacher from New York is suing a couple for her firing for a "racist" text message
A New York teacher is suing a couple for her discriminatory firing after she received a wrongly sent text message from her mother, in which she was named “other black woman” in the text message.
The couple refused to be racists and compared the lawsuit to "closure."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dismay when, on the first day of work in 2016, she discovered that Giselle Maurice's new educator was a black woman.
"NEZEEÉÉÉÉ, NEXT Černáška," she wrote. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she was sent by pi twice.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman, "disturbed" fired Mrs. Maurice and said that she had just left her governess, who was African-American, worked really badly, and that she was expecting the Philippines, he reported the New York Post.
Mrs Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for getting fired from work and asking for a fee of 350 dollars per six-month engagement day, for which she was initially hired, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not the case," she said to Post this Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
However, the twin returned a strike that they were not racists, but that the termination of the employed Mrs Maurice was an appropriate measure because they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her after that insult.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists," said her husband, Joel Plasco, the Post.
“But would you put your child in the hands of someone to whom you were being rude, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco resembled the "extortion" lawsuit and stated that his wife only cared for a two-month-old child and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Will you drive around like this?
That is not a nice thing," said the investment banker.
Although the trial still persists, the jury on the social media has condemned the couple very quickly for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of the stories about the bear, Pitchton, were afraid that readers would not be identified with the talking bear, showing the latest news
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, told the rapporteur: “It’s hard to get into a situation where someone first reads it before it’s published.
But it's very fun to know now that we already know the great success of thelovable bear beadton."
She stated that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired to write a children's book about a small teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, she added on the day of the 60th anniversary a book publication that became a "slender" dot after his death last year.
She added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success, as she described a “very important member of her family. ”
"He was quite a quiet man, he was never boastable at all," she said.
“But since Paddington was such a real figure to him, it was like you had a child who had achieved something that you could truly be proud of.
I think he looked at Mattton's success with this look.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he was always trying to attribute all the successes only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that this is really bad and that she does not expect to get away with it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nado, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye.
So I did.
I said, “Tash, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart running slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it inside me."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane together with other passengers without showing what a difficult test she is going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
“I kept my head down, tears running all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt a stunning understanding of Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Suffering women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending postcards to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers on which people can search for support.
Tyler's son, Mrs Davis, was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, took his life at age 18.
"I would not want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that her son was a gifted young cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile could turn on every room."
However, before his death, he left work because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his sibling’s immobil body after taking his own life.
Mrs Davis says: “I constantly fear how this will affect his life. ”
Ms Davis suggested postcards “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them even if they are their friends.
Do not sit silent - you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is an old friend of Mrs. Davies's, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me that he felt depressed or depressed, nothing at all," he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
It was the worst day of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, they didn't even look at them, nothing."
She stated that her partner’s death was a great trauma to them, but she had to gradually get through it: “This thing can make a complete hole in the family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to move on and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance of the FBI starting its investigation
“I thought we could get something that he actually asked for – an investigation at a time of limitations, with limited scope – we could bring a little unity into it,” said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would “break apart” because both sides of the party were going to bury themselves in cattle positions.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
The elections in the middle of the parliamentary term are only five weeks away from us, on 6 November, and if Republicans do what they expect to do wrong, it will lead to their fundamental weakening in the attempts to enforce the required man in the post at the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush was on the phone with the senators, lobbying with them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush and met with his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI gets their message?
The Senate will vote on this, and at present there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Yet it is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which has enabled Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea for Kim "declined"
The number of refugees from North to South Korea has fallen since the government of Kim Jong-Un seven years ago, claims the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry for Unification, stated that there were 1127 escapes in the last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that there was more stringent border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates required by smugglers at borders.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement on this.
The large majority of refugees from the North today are getting an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korea War in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has the longest border and it is easier to cross it than in a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Korea.
China looks at refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are still technically in the state of war – have improved significantly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the halted de-acclaration negotiations.
This happened in the historic June meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions for cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the US of not making any progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way of unilaterally disarming ourselves," said Mr Ri in his speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said it was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the democratic minority, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh a candidate for the Supreme Court “hysteric” and said that she was, thanks to her temperament, inappropriate for serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help myself, but if any woman had ever performed such a theatre, they would have called it "hysterical," Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh's Thursday statement before the Senate Court Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all charges for sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both still in puberty.
during his opening word, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and suffocated in the negotiations about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and stated that their accusations against it were "grotesque and coordinated attacks" by organised liberals who could not pass through the loss of Hillary Clinton in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi reported that Kavanaugh's testimony proved unable to work in the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by these statements and by the way he based himself on the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question of whether she would seek Kavanaugh's appeal in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had won a majority in the House.
“I will tell you this – if he does not tell Congress the truth, then he is not only eligible for work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is working on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential returns in the Law of Admissible Care or Roe vs. Wade, because she was considered a conservative judge.
As part of the hearings prior to his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided the answer to the question of whether he would reverse some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for a hysterical, preconceived person to join the court and expect us to say, "Oh, that's beautiful," Pelosi said.
And women have to rule it.
After verbal outbursts, months and years, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," said Mrs Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continues: “A woman who worked as a principal, who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she created a certain technique, which means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: “Maybe you think I am crying because I am sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she continued to do it.
And I think that's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office where men dominated, and I once expressed my unexplainable anger with crying, but the older, always cold manager, who I always feared, grabbed my neck and dragged me on the stairs.
"Never show them you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an illegitimate affair on board the Monkey Business ship and had to withdraw from the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
“Seven other candidates have been running and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had been running for a long time, she couldn't keep up with fundraising, so she committed herself not to play the game if she didn't get $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her 250 dollars.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, by frustration with the system that made her difficult to raise money and by focusing on the voters rather than delegates and on anger over sexism, that she was completely suffocated by anger.
"Maybe you would think I collapsed nervously," said Mrs Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"And you might have thought that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they might write to me on the tombstone.
"Crying"?
Why Can Be Chinese-American Business War For Beijing Good
The U.S.-China preliminary chamber of trade war was deafening and, although the battle is far from being overrun, according to experts, the gap between the countries in the long term was beneficial for Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, provided the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most important escalations, however, saw the light of the world this week when new tariffs for USD 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion) were announced, which means practically half of China's commercial exports to the USA.
Beijing reacted each time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of the 60 billion US imports.
China has tried to repay the US with the same coins, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world would kneel.
Even if China wanted Washington to go back to the original tracks, it would mean that he would withdraw from his demands, but public submission to the American requirements would be absolutely humiliating for Chinese President Si Jin-pching.
Even so, experts believe that if Beijing could play his cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long term because it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
“The fact is that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic sparrow in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have ever admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a research co-worker who focuses on Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return the refugees, claims the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's situation in the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists.
Now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are fulfilled, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that Syria has abandoned more than 5.5 million people since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that sponsored the insurgents.
Europe strongly responded to the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The Evria team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US team with a final score of 16,5 to 10,5 on the Le Golf National at the edge of the difficulties in France.
The US has now lost sixth in Europe, so Ryder Cup has not won in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached 14.5 points that were needed for the defeat of the US.
The star of the United States, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then blew up the ball in the water on the 3rd pair of 16th hole and let Francesco Molinari's victory.
The Italian golfer Molinari then shined in all his rounds and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest score, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-rated player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who probably graduated his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the best European player overall with 25,5 points won in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy to get the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He gave a cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up following this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 biggest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can compare.
The U.S. team has been struggling all weekend to find a fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have shown top golf throughout the tournament.
After dissatisfaction with the results of his team, Captain Jim Furyk said: “I was proud of these boys, really fighting.
This morning, we really warmed Europe at heart.
We really didn't make it.
I'm cutting off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward with PGA of America and Ryder Cup.

Update of the red tide: The concentrations are reduced in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to the overall drop in the red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC communication, water blooming spots are now reported from the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this suggests a decreasing concentration.
The blooming water of the red tide has a range of about 130 miles of coastline from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
The stains were observed about 10 miles from the coast in the Hillsborough district, but last week it was relatively less of a place.
The red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
In the Hillsborough district, low to high concentrations were observed on the high seas, the lowest to high concentrations in the Manatee district, the lowest to high concentrations off the coast or on the high seas in the Sarasota district, the lowest to medium concentrations in the Charlotte district, the lowest to high concentrations off the coast or on the high seas at the Lee district, and the low concentrations in the Collier district.
Respiratory irritations continue to occur in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in northwest Florida last week.
