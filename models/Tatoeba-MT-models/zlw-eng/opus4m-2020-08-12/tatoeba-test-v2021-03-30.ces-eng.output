Leave them for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to that meeting even though I was invited.

Who will Tom visit?
It's Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you ask me out for a drink?
Why won't Tom answer Mary's questions?

According to the Tateby Directives, members are advised to either add sentences in their native language or translate from a language they understand into their native language.
