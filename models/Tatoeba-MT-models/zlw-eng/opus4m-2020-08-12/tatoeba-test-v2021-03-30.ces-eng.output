He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before eating.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left a big tip on the table.
There's nothing like a glass of beer after a day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
I'm happy with my work so far.
Do you really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to that meeting even though I was invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you were probably dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
The dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for it.

So straight and then right and then?
I need you tomorrow.

Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer here.

Ancient customs are dying out fast today.
Tom's still busy.
You better get going now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I'm sorry to interrupt, I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What was Tom yelling at the crowd?
He's the perfect husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in costumes of the 17th century.
Are you happy with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?

Tom won't be at school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who will Tom visit?
It's Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you ask me out for a drink?
Why won't Tom answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I cannot answer this question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I'm not surprised if that happens.
He's single.
That's not what people normally say.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his feet very carefully.
Did you have breakfast this morning?

I'm perfectly happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary last night.
What's your dad's name?

Who are you?
Did you do it on purpose?

I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Get over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own.
Once we saw what Tom was wearing, we had a laugh attack.
Tom's wrong, right?
Better to be dead than to live red.

The horse is riding.
I borrowed the ridge.
