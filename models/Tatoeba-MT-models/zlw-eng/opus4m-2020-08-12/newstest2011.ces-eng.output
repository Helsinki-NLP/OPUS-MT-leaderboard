What will it start? ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the confectionery
The new city councillors from ČSSD seem to have to overcome a language barrier to understand their old-fashioned ODS colleagues on the Prague Council and the office.
The daily Aktuálně.cz members of the new council from the ČSSD "tested" as they know the notoriously established slang, which was established at the town hall in recent years when the current coalition partners ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary introduced by Prague’s political society during the previous era by Mayor Pavel Bém describes some of the most famous characters, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new councillors did not understand well known concepts.
At least that's what he says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer in Prague politics," replied Lukáš Kaucky, a councillor for culture, to the test of the "Motrove" dictionary.
Although it is a political veteran, also Councilman Karel Březina responded.
Like the concept of "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you ever present to me that I sometimes use."
"I don't generally recognize other slang."
From the dictionary, whose expressions were published in June before the ODS election Congress by the daily daily Aktuálně.cz, the editor chose six examples, mainly those that are notoriously connected with the Prague Magistrate.
The socialists should explain the terms "Voldemort", "Biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the confectionery", "the bull's neck", "the betrayal of the capital" and "pleach".
The trio of the council members agreed with the quiz, the fourth one - Antonín Weinert, which is to be the head of Prague education in the future - first promised the interview, but later did not answer the phone.
Fifth Councilman Petr Dolínek rejected the test.
"I don't deal with these things at all, and I'm not going to judge how civic Democrats are having fun."
"I am now dealing with how we will understand each other within our programmes," he replied.
As has already been said, Councilman Lukáš Kaucky would not have recognized in the headline above that there is talk of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the exprimator Bém Roman Janousek.
"Voldemort" tells Kaucky nothing, and the only term he correctly estimated in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"This is Blanka's tunnel," Kaucky says, and he adds, "But I know that from the papers."
"I'm gonna have to pay for a language course," he's joking.
The golf hole is then deciphered not only by the matador Karel Březina, but also by the environmental councillor Lukáš Plachy.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plachym is familiar with where to find this figure - they suspect the meaning of the term "go to the confectionery".
"I think that means going to some Prague business," Plachy is close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
In line with Březina, he recalls that he has drawn knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
There is no similar dictionary of slang terms in social democracy according to the frequency tests.
"I was happy with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes using abbreviations and complex names," says the President of Prague ČSSD, Petr Hulinský, who is called Hulda.
"At school, they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," admits to Karel Březina's own nickname.
The daily News.cz has tried and worked out the name.
Councilman Weinert is for the guardians Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, representative of Miroslav Poche, who pointed out the party's sponsoring fraud before the election, has a nickname for "Igraček" among some of his colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only thing that social democrats admit in the intra-party speech.
Hulánský said he didn't like to hear Huldu, but the daily Aktuálně.cz also recorded another nickname of this Prague President.
The "doctor of footwear law" says that Petr Hulínský won his degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", published a brochure
The women declared in Burkina Faso as witches have several common characters.
Rather, they are part of an older generation, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
The one who "will" become a witch is sent into isolation so it doesn't threaten the rest of the village.
"Men can only rarely do this fate."
"The young healthy women do not even move away because they help to work and give birth to children," describes the orderly sister who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, takes care of more than a hundred women in a special house, who have banished their communities from their ranks.
The local government has now decided to intervene against an unusual "social measure".
She published an information brochure that should help limit witch hunts.
It's a big deal.
"More than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso can't read," noted the paper Die Standard.
The accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, next door to Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, and they poured kerosene and burned her.
The BBC server reported the case.
The perpetrators claim it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointing was ignited on the woman.
They said the band was burning after they tried to "divine an evil spirit out of a woman."
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42 - year - old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "The eaters of human souls have always posed danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the witch hunt is trying to ease the government, the President himself participated in Gambia last year.
"Gambi's president Jammi, after his aunt's death, unleashed a large-scale witch hunt, which was supposed to be involved in her death and sought black magic to kill the President himself."
"He invited shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and personal security officers of the President, violently took men and women from the Gambian villages to the President's farm in Kanilai," she said in her report, Amnesty International.
On the farm, imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two incarcerated stays on the farm didn't survive.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
Bakal's tenant: He's drowning in stoves, higher rent signed
The older man stepped out of the door of the client center of the company "Uhlobarona" by Zdenek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a file with new leases to three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son, who is in the execution of the punishment.
All three of them have just raised their rent.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay 2+1 for the second category of 4100 crowns from next year.
"And there is no hot water and there must be a petrama drowning (a stone for solid fuel, note red)," the man points out with his finger in his son's new treaty, whose signature he has full power.
"But I signed it," he explains in half angry and half resisted.
The Civic Association of BytyOKD.cz, which called the new lease conditions "uncorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until 7 December when it will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But a man is just waving his hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it," he's frowning.
Ostrava becomes a large laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year's Eve, a large majority of apartments that still have a non-market rent in the Czech Republic are waiting.
Currently.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The Havířov waiting room RPG is one of a total of four in Ostrava and is already full on Tuesday at 9am.
Right next to the door, there's security from the security agency and a starting device.
"Cast 2011" lights a special button on his touch screen.
One tap and a numbered piece of paper comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your numbers are already beeping on a large display below the ceiling of the waiting room.
You'll be next in half a second.
After a while, the older couple comes to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room does not seem to be related to new rents.
Most people have come to solve common problems as usual - repair applications, insurance events and so on.
Letters with new leases are received in Ostrava by tenants from the majority of 44 000 flats portfolio RPG from about mid-November.
RPG The apartments in their letters suggest an increase in rent by 15 to 38 percent.
The special bulkhead for new rents was opened at the client centre on November 18th.
"It's been over a week, so it's only in the race," the workers answer after a moment of hesitation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, Lubomír Zaorálek from ČSSD took him up loudly and is now full of local newspapers.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"Neither did they change my toilet record," says the man mentioned in the introduction.
The most important thing so far according to the workers are the pensioners coming to see if they will get a discount on rent if they sign in time as RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half the discount on February rent will also be given to other tenants who will sign the new contract by December 15.
The Havířov "deregulatory" partition but the questions are definitely not covered.
"There were only about 40 to 50 people out of 360 clients yesterday due to the 2011 rent," they estimate.
On the web and its board RPG proposes individual contractual arrangements where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, they will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It is not a threat, but only a possible and legitimate legal procedure," RPG warns on his website.
"Nobody will judge here," thinks one of the employees of RPG Apartments, and the man on the street outside the client center gives it a partial answer.
"I'm 13,000 retired, and I've got $5,000 left to eat, I don't have enough to judge," he says.
After all, the worker is in vain.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek is telling them not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
The regulation of rents ends in the majority of the Czech Republic with New Year 2011 and according to RPG Apartments is their increased economic necessity.
"The current rent still does not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," says Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Apartments, that the malpractice of the housing fund by the angry tenant is the main reason why the rent increase is due to the house owners.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest four billion in apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014, it will be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seat of the Havírov waiting room so far repeats several red-marked information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31 200 flats, that's more than 90% of flats RPG."
"And it will always be the most 7.50 CZK per square metre and month," appears on the screen.
Only for 400 flats from the portfolio of RPGs, the rent is increased by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square metre," warns RPG.
For 2600 apartments next year, the rent will remain the same.
RPG The apartments promise that deregulation will not cast out rents jumpy, but will be spread out in four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) will put the company back in flats, mainly in heat savings - new windows and warming.
They're supposed to be given priority by people who sign a lease increase agreement.
Offices include kindergartens, architects understand
The Avriopoint Administrative Building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one expected that he was also hiding a mini school with everything that included - colourful walls, creative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch.Design employees can visit it.
The project-architectonic company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important buildings in Brno, has been counting on the space for its company minischool since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs almost 90 people mostly at the age of babyboom and she wanted women designers and architects to get back to work quickly.
Together with the possibility of shorter periods, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees in the framework of the social programme.
Staves and architects thus have the opportunity to combine a demanding job with the care of the child.
The minischool was invented by the Arch.Design employees themselves and with the support of the management they managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Company minischool is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grant funding (a grant of CZK 2,8 million) they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and for two years provide qualified staff and operation.
After exhaustion of the financial subsidy (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate a minischool at its own expense for a period of 3 years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the application for the grant was significantly assisted by Economy Rating.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the nursing nurse and the teacher of the Ministry of Education provides all-day care for children, so that children can go to kindergarten without age limitations, yet most of them are older than 3 years.
Since it is a "minischool", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more are replaced during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of the position in the company.
Although this is an individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-school is comparable to the pre-school education framework programme.
Children not only play here, but also have quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation to school benches, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with computers that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their children at any time and face stress situations with delayed child picking up from kindergartens away from their parents ’ workplace.
Parents use working hours more productively.
No wonder there is a naturally loyal employee-employee relationship.
Arch.Design joined Czech companies, which offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program strengthened personnel marketing.
The bone house is fascinating even after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairwell resembles the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are open with a fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the locals, thanks to their organic shapes, he earned a nickname from the House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facades resembling scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all typical of the Art Nouveau Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house is played by dream lines, delicate colors and textures resembling nature and animals.
The detailed observations show geometry, rhythm, and a well-thought-out order.
At night, the whole facade of houses is more dramatic, lit up so that the impression of the shine of colors is even stronger.
The winding and twisting of shapes is equally present in the interiors.
The wood in the waves copies the window frames, rails, decorative elements of the doors, cuckoos and rails.
House Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district on Passeig de Grácia shopping street No. 43, was rebuilt by architect Emilio Sala Cortes from 1877.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon Gaudí's idea for an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batlló, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was on his designer board that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaic on the facade.
A number of other artists and artists also worked on the facade.
The joint work on Casa Batlló's designs has started successful cooperation with Jujol and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá and Güell Park, in which there are other works of Gaudí.
From locals, the house soon to completion earned its organic nickname "The House of Bones".
Others have started calling it "the calling house" because of the specific opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia, is depicted at the top of the building.
The hidden religious motifs also contain other sculpture elements of the building.
Gaudí designed for his time a unique system of central heating with air vents and typical chimneys.
The bizarre may seem their 45-degree slope.
In the work of Gaudí, he did not respect the building regulations at that time and did not let them bind.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the information on the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, when finishing, the city council was reinstated and applied for correction.
For example, the councilman was concerned about the fact that the construction was also affecting the pillars in the public pavement.
There has never been a remedy, on the contrary: only 15 days after the challenge of the city section, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the top two floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a lounge and on the third floor a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house crosses the stairs, which can be climbed up to the roof terrace itself.
The main elements of the reconstruction were the removal of all right angles and direct lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the living room doors and the larger society can communicate comfortably without, at the same time, maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facade, the house with Gaudí's reconstruction also gained a unique roof and two extra floors.
Gaudí's game with light, blue and white glazed tiles is also impressive, with which the inner courtyard and lights are placed.
The game of two colors adds maximum light in all floors of the house.
Just bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which, on the contrary, absorbs sunlight.
The Casa Batlló House, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house, the most spacious and precious apartment is made available to the public.
The owners decided to do this only in 2002, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed for the tours, since they found that this was a very advantageous business and, in addition, expanded the tours by common and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
The entrance to the monument is certainly not negligible, amounting to 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The sum far exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you need to be friends quickly with one of the tenants and visit him directly at home.
How to select mattresses and grates: women have different requirements than men
Not the magnificent frame of the bed, but the quality of the bed, i.e. mattresses and grates, give the basis for a really good bed.
However, it must be harmoniously supplemented to suit a particular user.
A lot of things are decided when choosing, from the weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior into which mattresses and grates are purchased.
Typical example?
For example, there are no suitable latex mattresses for weekend cottages where they do not sink regularly, because they are slowly "heating".
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than the standard polyurethane mattress.
In doing so, it is necessary to turn them regularly.
If they don't have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they're still lying on a solid board, they're holding moisture: there could be mold underneath them.
The custom also determines when choosing one.
Who spent a long time abroad, where they often use a very high mattress with a softening layer, will find it difficult to feel good on the low and hard surface.
"I hope all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me about not sleeping here."
"On their broken shoulders, heels and hips, they needed a mattress with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misinterpret "information" from their joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in tangled furniture.
Many hockey companies, as well as other customers, were therefore looking for a mattress with lazy foam years ago.
"Today it's fine, the appropriate mattress has Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be the NHL guy to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "miracle" works easy.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you don't roll over at night like after a tough game.
You'll just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against spillages.
When selecting the size of a mattress, add a foot length to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in the case of a double bed, 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example for singles, it is recommended that at least 120 to 140 cm.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands slightly crouched in your elbow," recommends Ing. Helena Prokopová, the characteristic of the Centrifugal and Decorative Characteristics, which has been dedicated to healthy sleeping and ergonomics of furniture for many years and has been teaching at professional schools.
For a double bed, each needs its own grate and mattress, but here beware when buying to tune the heights of mattresses.
There will be nothing left to do but install grates to different heights, but this may not happen for each bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring-boned types of at least 15, of which at least three centimetres count on the forming and kyping layer.
"When touching your hands or sitting on a mattress, you must definitely not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Full-boiled beds, where mattresses and bases are like growing Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses aren't ventilating, their covers can't be washed, which is common today.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters per night, it is clear that after five to seven years of mattresses, one large (and clogged) net begins to resemble.
Therefore, experts refuse advertising slogans on mattress life for up to 25 years or even life assurances.
But everything has its own.
Therefore, advice from salesmen: for mattresses with a width of 120 cm or 140 cm of hygiene and work-proof coating do not give up, but add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Even though the covers of mattresses are normally produced today throughout the circuit, we get two parts (for washing and washing the size of the washing machine very important!), however, handling in larger types (and in one person) when reading might remind us of the battle of light weight in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead of a grate?
Never!
Maximum bed for one night visits.
However, you will still have the board (if it doesn't have it anymore) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with spring bone and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it).Taschenfederkern) and a kysing layer.
Polyurethane mattress does not belong to such a base.
The non-positioning lamele grates with 14 to 18 lamels will be suitable for latex or sandwich mattresses (such as a combination of latex and coconut), but you can always pay for grates with more lamells, 28 or more, where lamels in the area of lumbars are doubled and their rigidity can be regulated.
The spring-bone mattress does not belong to the positioning lamele grate because it does not respond to the positioning.
The so-called shoulder cradle can also be used in addition to the set-up of the lamells.
This is a special fixation that allows you to push, or even tilt, the lamele so that the shoulder of the sleeper "breaks apart".
For men who have "arms across their backs," it's definitely an important thing.
Even the mattress manufacturers who started using the softening zone in the "men" area of their shoulders even remember it.
They also remember women - they give them a softer surface in places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed wings or wafers with so-called multi-torn washing.
The pressure is broken down into more points and the voltage is reduced.
But be careful, once you use the right mattress and grate wrong pillow (big and "inflated"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and tip only to the shoulders in order to relax the shoulder muscles.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, which they prefer in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the cushion should level the shoulder height (with the shoulder grate or the softened zone in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have nothing to do with the original straws filled with grass.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least adjuncts.
Trendem's just bio mattresses, too.
The crude oil from which polyurethane foams are produced is replaced by natural oils, such as Jump and Soya.
Maybe all known producers are using soy.
"Bio at mattresses means that the core is made of purely natural materials," explains Petr Vašček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also use microcapsules to relax the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There is a division for men and women.
While a man "cools" a plant extract from the birch to absorb heat from a mattress and cools the body, the women on the contrary the covers "melts".
Red pepper extract increases the circulation of blood, so it's warmer to the weaker sex.
Today's favorites?
The mattress made of cold foam (it has bigger pores with broken cell structure, it is so much more breathtaking than normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
By combining various cold foams and "line" foams, multi-zone mattresses are created, which know exactly where the head, shoulders and heel should be.
You'll pay about seven thousand crowns for a high-quality mattress.
Those that meet health parameters have a lower VAT rate are taken as medical devices.
It was the first in the Czech Republic to achieve this advantage of Gumotex.
Saving on a mattress and grate is not easy.
Sometimes you can use events of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with memory foam sewn in memory for 11 990 crowns.
The second can be purchased free of charge.
The era of lazy, or visco-elastic foams with an open cell structure and high density started at the "space" tempo of Tempur material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA because the astronauts were exposed to enormous overload at the start.
The tempur in the heat is soft, while in the cold it is firmened.
The warm human body is so perfectly adapted and optimally decomposes its pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the emergence of beds, but also for increasing comfort in sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for medical products, such as special pillows under the feet that lighten the legs and the venous system.
For example, domestic producers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and so forth.
People's surveillance equipment wants more and more parents, so they want to keep their kids.
Fear for your own child brings more and more people to the idea of watching through GPS.
The system originally created for the search for cars can also monitor the movement of people and thus help in cases such as the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
So far, the device is about as big as a matchbox, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
A number of people scared the case of the missing Anička and started to pry about ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of infringing their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about another means of reducing the likelihood of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that, in some cases, such devices may be abused, for example, if they are put in a bag by someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," added Pilin.
According to him, a child should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if the baby doesn't want to wear anything like that, she'll just get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose some things when they don't want to be in control."
"Big expectations were previously triggered by mobile phones, which can be turned off as well as this tracking device," Bočková says.
According to her, it is also disputed whether, in the event of an attack, such a device would actually help.
"As for the planned kidnapping, the offender will practically always ensure that the child does not have any electronics to reveal his location."
"Now it's a phone."
"When the tracking devices begin to expand, they will also look for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In that case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it acknowledges that a similar device can help in the event of a sudden pedophile attack.
According to Robert Čech, RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and persons, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after the attack, its presence can help.
"The device can be set to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned shall be available."
"A more expensive device has also built-in tilting meters, so even if one slips and remains motionless, the device will immediately send a warning to indicate the location," Czech says.
According to him, even smart mobile phones with navigation can take a similar service, where special software can be loaded.
The problem with the current tracking units is that they are either devices similar to pendants the size of a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
They're always at risk of losing them.
According to Pilin, Macro Weil is therefore now testing equipment that looks like a normal digital watch.
"This will have the greatest advantage that any aggressor may not recognize a tracking device at all."
"Or he will recognize them after a while and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking equipment develops into bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology used for car-sitting.
This is a combination of GPS positioning (which uses normal auto navigation) and mobile phone functions that report the current position of the car.
The army has a line of fire to wrap up the Czech Republic, but it will last only two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of ropes that set off explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres of rope to the warehouses.
The military has a supply of 225 years.
The problem is, the line life is two or four years at most.
The army bought the burnt cords from the STV Group, a. s. stock for 40 million crowns.
In order to justify the purchase of such a large number of MF DNES cords, the General Staff wrote that soldiers use 60 km of lighters per year in training.
However, it appears from the calculations of the military bomb squads that MF DNES addressed, that then all generals, officers of the army, secretary or cleaning staff would have to go through very intensive pyrotechnic training each year.
Minister of Defense Alexander Vondra and army commander Vlastimil Pick excepted.
That's the only way to justify the annual consumption of an army of 60 km of lighters.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, military supplies would be enough for more than ten years.
On the contrary, if it were true that a maximum of two metres of cords, as experts say, and an army of fresh purchases, would be enough to train each new professional - even with increased consumption of ginseng or special units - supplies for the above 225 years.
Recently, the troops of the fast-track brigade complained to Minister Vondra personally that they had almost no bullets in their handguns, so shootings are also limited because of the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't think they're buying so many lighters from us again and again."
"But it's their decision, and I'm sure they know what they're up to."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we are trying to meet as traders," says the business manager of STV Group Jan Dìcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometres of cords purchased even by the army having supplies of this "munitions" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from STV Group, however, speaks only about the four-year life of a lighter and police or military bomb squad even for two years.
"With perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to publish a name because of military criticism.
After the lifetime, each ammunition must carefully test whether it is still reliable and does not threaten soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry is the quantitative discount of 445 km of ignition cords.
"We stood at 60 percent less than last year's delivery of 200 forty miles," interpreting spokesperson Dog's opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of a line of police bombardment, which destroys ammunition from World War II or from the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order enough to use this ammo even before the end of the lifetime.
It worked for her because of the safety of pyrotechnics and can also be more flexible in getting more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence has already had considerable difficulties in disposing of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the 200-thousand Czechoslovak army was preparing to go to the Rhine.
According to the Czech bomb squad, which MF DNES addressed, the same problem awaits in a few years: it will destroy hundreds of kilometres of old lighters, which today "Latino" buys.
To this day, I am drawing on the contacts I have gained from the competition
The winning place in the Živnostník of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell his hotel's franchise.
The winner of last year's competition Živnostník of the year became the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His story of success is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun liked to travel.
And he realized abroad that Liberec lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and with bank credit he bought a semi-damaged house with five flats.
To be a student of the third year of college at that time, that was a lot of courage.
"The ratio between quality and price of accommodation in our country did not give me to try to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to rent to foreign workers.
All the profits he invested back in the house, which gradually converted into a guest house with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years business gradually managed to open four guesthouses in Liberec, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently a four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, another, of the same quality came to him.
"We just have a signed contract with the hotel in the island of Tisa, where we sold our franchising concept and other interested in the Frankise of the Pytloun hotels," says last year's dealer number one.
"And on this sale of the license to operate the hotel was a great deal of victory in the Živnostník of the Year competition," Pytloun admits.
The victory brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People met me on the streets, they often congratulated me on this, and I have to say that it was pleasant," he recalls.
Participation in the competition definitely recommends all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win, any visibility is good.
He says he's still drawing on contacts and connections he might not have gotten to.
"Some of the people I met with thanks to the competition, I started to trade regularly."
The glory associated with success according to him has kind of affected every employee.
And that he had about seventies.
"I see more loyalty and pride in being involved in something that has become widely recognized."
"It's far from my personal success, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is put forward," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we had at the Farmet.
The euphoria of victory quickly replaced the impact of the crisis.
However, thanks to the winner’s purpose, Farmet has had worse times.
For the prize for the first place in the last year of the Vodafone competition The company ran out of the owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žďárský in the Slovanské House last year.
The jury then appreciated the efforts made by building a company with hundreds of million turnover from a small tool shop in České Skalica.
"I can say that the award encouraged not only me, but all my coworkers and increased our self-confidence for the competition," says the winner last year.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered to father Karl Žďárski to rent a small workshop as compensation for the communists confiscated property, he did not hesitate long, refused a career at the company where he worked, and with a few friends around his dad they set up a company for plastic baths.
Not long afterward, they began to specialize in vegetable oil foxes.
After eighteen years, they became the largest producer of automatic foxes in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among the unprofessional public reached the firm after success in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers began to perceive the Farmet brand much better, but foreign partners also started to appreciate that they cooperated with a company that has achieved greater success in its country," says Karel Žďárský.
The last year, however, was not only a sign of the euphoria of victory at the Farmet.
The award was based on the company’s economic results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And in 2009, it was the hardest year for the sale of engineering goods.
It has peaked a crisis that has not affected citizens so much, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and began to restrict the purchase of new machinery and technology.
"This situation, of course, has not avoided us."
"The trades dropped by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and the redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company has to be able to take such unpopular measures sometimes.
But they handled the situation and kept the company profitable, even if smaller than before the crisis.
However, what is not discounted at the Farmet is investment in research and development.
"With subsidies we have built a research and training centre, we have strengthened the presentation at international fairs, we have won the main awards in home exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The sales are growing again and the number of new employees with them.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A web browser that removes pointless rules
A survey on the Absurdite of the Year is a fourth part of the business clan.
Some senseless regulations have already been lifted.
The infamous winner of the next edition of the Absurdita survey of the year has become the obligation to carry documents that are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the less than four thousand voters decided to do so.
For example, social security management required a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official can obtain it with two clicks of the mouse.
The poll's gonna change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require a statement from the Commercial Register when checks are carried out by the insurers," said the spokesperson of ČSZ Jana Buraňová.
Enlighten all regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and make sense of the Absurdita of the Year.
This year is the fourth part of the business clan organized by Hospodářské noviny, and among the public is increasingly popular.
This year, if about three thousand voters took part in the vote, almost four thousand of them were already present.
And there's no wonder, all kinds of legal duties that are used only to stall business, there's still a lot and a lot.
"We are in the leading places in the world in the number of lejsters to admit tax," notes Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurship has become the declared objective of all governments in recent years.
However, compared with the world, the situation is not improving particularly in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has placed itself in the 74th position in terms of business conditions, eight more places than last year.
The Absurdita of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and takes place annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can apply for administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September when the competition is closed.
The website address www.firmaroku.cz will then be selected by the organizer of the competition by seven candidates for "anticene" and will allow the public to vote on it during October on the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred regulations, more precisely 105 regulations, and a regulation that lacks sense, have been entered into this year's survey.
The tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by trade unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition there was, for example, a requirement that wagons for the maintenance of motorways and highways should pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets should paint every two years.
This year's list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which is always taking place at the beginning of November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the happening, which regularly participates in the personality of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted this year.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws entrepreneurs under their feet, so my goal is to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which are only making business unnecessary today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Trying to break a ridiculous order doesn't sound empty.
In 2007, people were most upset by the obligation to report to the Trade Office three days in advance at the place where a permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with a stand for an exhibition or a pilgrimage.
This obligation has been removed by the amendment to the Trade Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was to report to the employment office for its foreign staff a mission of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And to the third of all good.
Absurdite in 2009 became a regulation for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two landing scales in the office.
This was mitigated by the Department of Health decree this year - the obligation to have a fridge has fallen.
New category awards socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
This year, the fifth year of competitions of Hospodářské noviny is a category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the advertiser and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of the rebel contest of the year.
This year's first year of this special sub-category of the Vodafone Main Competition The company of the year 2010 has signed up for companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would publish a separate article.
Although the subject matter of their activity differs diametrically from one another, aid and consideration can be considered as the common denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people, and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen public finalists, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubicky Region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor for 17 years to the foundation fund sponsoring handicapped children.
The paper mill from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 percent of it, has been awarded the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia Region and the Vodafone Company of the Year has placed in the region as a third.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced flexible working hours, won an additional reduction to an average of 35 hours a week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded the title for buying from Czech producers, supporting civic activities in the immediate environment and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration will have as little environmental impact as possible," explains the director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from Ústecký region is thinking about the health of its employees and has provided them with ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local protected workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the Human in Need Foundation, which helps specifically the local Romani community," says the representative of the company, Ondrej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundry and cleaning from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to their employees in the form of above-standard bonuses in addition to their pension insurance.
"We are giving food, transport, higher qualifications and recreation to us again," says Josef Strapač from the construction company of the Brno Times, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The Responsible Company of the Year category was automatically registered with all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year, who answered the questions attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
The incorrect or incomplete questionnaire replies were then excluded by the organiser from the evaluation.
"If competition representatives did not answer the questions, the Responsible Company of the Year could not participate in the competition, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"It is not possible to enter this competition alone because it is a sub-category of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizer agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, police arrested in a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, anti-corruption police arrested in the past few days.
The detectives put the iron on the local entrepreneur in the media and real estate business Luboš G.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate the ongoing public tender to settle the restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition was acquired by a specific bidder.
Luboshi G. was supposed to pay half a million crowns for it.
"In the meantime, I can only confirm that the police are suing one person for a crime in a public contract and in a public competition," said the Law of the head of the Plzeň State Prosecutor Antonie Zelena, saying that further details cannot be provided in the light of the ongoing investigation.
Sixty-four-year-old businessman was released by police after 24 hours.
In view of the minimum of official information, it is possible to speculate on how the competition could have been affected.
The spokesperson of Lubomír Černá Land Fund, on a question of Rights, stated that policemen had actually arrested in a separated workplace in Pilsen during a public competition.
"This was a client, not our employee," she stated.
According to the Černá, the public competition has the right title "Call for the submission of claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and takes place in case more eligible applicants show an interest in the land offered.
"These persons in the context of the call offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the land."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of the acquirers shall be determined and the Land Fund shall then be transferred to the person who offered the highest rights," the spokesperson of the Fund explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who applied for the call, and because he himself is also a legitimate person, because he bought a number of restitution claims, offered to the interested parties that he would not participate in the competition.
Apparently, he was recovering his paychecks.
That would explain that he had so much money to hold back.
Luboš G. had superior contacts with PF in Pilsen already in the past.
He was set up in the case of former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was criminally prosecuted for restitution of land on which a decision was made on the location of the building.
It was then that Luboš G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public transport, specifically in the place where the arrival bus was to be built into the Borská field industrial zone.
Later, he changed them very favorably with a bus station for a house in the very historical center of the city, which was worth much higher.
At that time, the town hall had to proceed, otherwise, by blocking the property, it would have put the construction in jeopardy.
Households for living will pay hundreds of months
From January, households will have to pay not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and slope, supplies of heat, and rents will grow somewhere.
Families will have to pull hundreds of crowns a month more from January than now.
Electricity will increase by up to 4.6 percent, the gas will be about 2% more expensive, until you have to pay a tenth for water supplies in some cities, and often also increase the supply of central heat.
Electricity recovery should be based on hundreds of irritants in the flats every year than now.
The prices of power electricity have all been reduced by the main suppliers, so there is a significant increase in the promotion of renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaics.
Although the gas will increase slightly, however, at a time when people are most drowning and have the highest consumption.
They must therefore also count on hundreds of extra crowns per year.
While electricity and gas will increase throughout the country, the change in central heating prices differs from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 CZK a month from January for central heating, more than 1000 CZK per year for families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague again threaten to increase their rents from infrastructure by more than 9 percent.
If the rent doesn't change, they'll pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower comparisons.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, it is supposed to undercut by 7.4 percent.
For example, they can significantly increase the rental price in 450 000 rental apartments, where the regulation ends from January.
For example, CPI Apartments, which owns about 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase rents by up to 100 percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new lease are going to put the company in court.
The regulated rents paid by people in approximately 300,000 apartments could increase by up to 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with fernet and rum. Beer is fashionable, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are the drinks whose drinking most often ends in the care of doctors drunkards who haven't been around for 15 years.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly from a monkey in a hospital.
This is based on the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases in the incomes of children’s hospitals.
"Some beers or wines are completely unfavorable because it takes a long time for you to get drunk."
"Trend is certainly a hard drink," said the primary of the children's department at the Hospital Hořovice in central Bohemia Luděk Pelikán.
"If they can pull a bottle out of their dad's closet, it's whiskey, but it's fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of pouring it into the juice and not feeling so much of it," the chief explained.
And the spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital, Motol Eva Jurin, also gives him the truth.
"It's mostly fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol especially in primary schools today."
"In some cases, it was the swine that they brought from home," said Jurinová.
According to Prime Minister Pelikan, 13 or 14-year-old drunkards are quite common on hospital income.
Before Hořovice, where he has been since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances bind underprivileged schoolchildren from a wide area.
"One girl was at our house about four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was brought to us with 3.5 mills of alcohol in her blood, in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at a fairground in Holešovice at some dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't find it odd that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the chief wondered.
It is the lack of parents’ interest or even their considerable tolerance to drink their own offspring that is considered the main cause of growing child drinking.
However, addiction in the true sense cannot be talked about in children according to experts.
"The term alcoholist means a multi-year chronic alcohol addiction with all the phenomena that belong to it, and that is not the case with children."
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is a rather noticeable failure of family-social background," explained Pelikán.
According to spokesperson Jurin this year, approximately 40 drunk children were hospitalized in Motole Paediatric Clinic by mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication that had to remain in the hospital will enter the statistics.
After an outpatient treatment, children’s drunkards, who take their parents, or the police, will take them home, do not count.
Except in cases where children just sit down and drink a bottle of liquor, there are three seasonal fluctuations according to Pelikan that can be relied on: witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"They either drink the grief from the wrong testimony, or they celebrate the beginning of the summer."
"I have experienced seven children's drunks at the same time for witches," said Pelikán.
The drunkard who spends the night with a detoxication under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically in contrast to the one who is having an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
In the morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, the body will start a watering infusion with glucose and nutrients that are missing.
"They're actually better off because they have a good wake after the beautiful evening experience, and nothing hurts."
"Only they are confused about where they are," the Pelikán admitted, saying, sometimes, that they spoil the pleasant mood at least by calculating the costs that their treatment has required.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will also be made up of tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used it as an educational tool sometimes, when I was directly counting on the children's vision how much their drunkenness was and that they could also spend the whole summer in the brigade to make money for the one party," added Pelikán.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not approach regression procedures in which parents would incur treatment costs in the case of child drunkards.
Two L-159 aircraft are first in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft from the total of five units, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced Casa C-295M, flew on Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the ownership of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they've only been on exercises or demonstrations in a foreign country.
It is a two-digit version of the L-159T1, which was still operated by the Czech army and which were able to fly.
The remaining three machines are L-159.
So far, they are being preserved in Aer Vodochody and the trade broker - Omnipol company - already took over last week.
When the aircraft are physically released from Vodochod, according to Jan Pejšek, the defence department is not yet known.
"The L-159 multi-stakeholder aircraft for the exchange have been allocated from long-term aircraft, without further deposits and investments by the Ministry."
"Two-digit L-159T1 have been changed in the current state and form," he said.
He added that the army would not remain without two-seater aircraft because in May 2009 the Ministry signed a contract with Aero Vodochody worth CZK 200 million for the reconstruction of four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seater machines.
One new aircraft took over the army in July, the other takes over by the end of this year.
According to Puppy, EADS has committed to deploying aircraft into the arms of some Allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the customer of the L-159 aircraft is EADS and will serve to train the pilots from the NATO countries."
"Therefore, it is a matter for the customer how he will implement this matter," said Pášek.
Hospodářské noviny earlier stated that e.g. the Spanish army had no interest in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of another three CZK 3.5 billion aircraft was approved by the Government of Mirka Topolánek last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not write on the purchase of the tender and addressed the EADS directly.
The defence management then argued by supporting the future export of L-159 abroad by exchange.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and only uses 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa's planes is likely to have court-martialed.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court because it should have chosen aircraft on the basis of a Europe-wide tender and not by addressing one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one should arrive at Prague Airport Kbely within fourteen days.
Longer index finger than a ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a index finger longer than a ring finger are at less risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Cancer Journal.
It could be related to the level of male testosterone hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under the age of 60," said the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The breast could thus help to identify who men should undergo prostate cancer tests, especially in combination with genetic risks or other risk factors such as family health burden, added Eeles.
In 1994-2009, she and her colleagues watched more than 1500 prostate cancer patients and more than 3,000 healthy men in parallel.
More than half of the study participants had a index finger on the right hand than a ring finger.
They had the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
However, for those who had a index finger longer than a ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent for men up to the age of 60, a decrease of up to 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - shaped in the prenatal period - seems to reflect the various levels of the sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous studies have shown that testosterone is the one that supports growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes for the CTK, said that he knew about this study commonly, but he does not think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer would be "fully proven".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most Europe, is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and pavements there is mostly snowed, road drivers in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89. and 93. km in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of both trucks and passenger cars and it also stands at Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was told by the Dispatch of the Central Automobile.
On the 91st kilometer there crashed a truck, on the 93rd kilometer crashed two trucks, the accident required injury.
Several personal cars also ended up in the ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway on the 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should drive just behind Brno on the 190 km or cross Brno and then drive on 182 km to Kývalka.
It's a multi-mile column.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, a multiinch layer of snow is lying, thermometers show a minus seven degrees of centimetres.
The cars are formed on Prosek, for example, and Štěrboholská is also blocked.
The most secure means of transport is the subway.
The tram runs late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and the Square of Peace.
At 8:00 a.m., the Prague crisis crew is to meet again.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech Railways already had to cancel seven speed connections because of the snow.
For example, it has problems from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
The airport of Ruzyně was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in southern Moravia are already mobile, but only with increased caution.
In Vyškovsko three by-roads are impenetrable, in Brno the places form snow languages and in Blanensko are necessary to overcome some of the roads in the above snow chains.
The most affected places included Vyškovsko.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milesovice.
We're gonna have to put the frescoes in the stretch.
When they're cleared, it's not yet estimated.
Caution is needed in Hodonínsk in the White Carpathian region.
On the roads, which are maintained only by inert spray due to nature protection, a five-inch layer of snow lies.
In the Czech Republic it hit from two to ten centimeters of snow, the most it fell in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region about 15 centimeters of snow attacked.
The snow in the Czech Republic is gradually dropping.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the code name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" for their benefit.
A new weapon is like a small, super-precision cannon.
Her projectiles guide lasers with accuracy to a few meters.
Special bullets weigh 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing a high explosive explosive, actually function as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only at the impact of the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected from the top, and if the murderous rain of steel shards on it, it can eliminate it from the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for the infantry that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier treats her in principle by finding the target, sending a laser beam to him that determines the distance, so he gets a specific point of intent, adjusts the pressure and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"If you pull the trigger, the gun will be charged and detonated at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," said Audette.
400 jobs will be transferred
Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will transfer their jobs in July next year from the existing administrative building to the Marienbader square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company will move Fujitsu from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
On Wednesday, 400 men and women will move their jobs from an administrative building to a Marienbader square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyonská Street, in the part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the spokesman of Fuguer, there should be another 100 jobs of the group, which are so far divided in the region.
The rental offer was said to have been very attractive and the large space office in Astro Park is said to be more suitable for the staff.
Also in Bad Homburg Fujitsu was only in rent.
The competent agent Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure".
Excellent link to the airport is very important for a global society like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners yesterday and disappointment to the losers.
The Head of the Economic Referent in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this was the way to get a "global player".
It's said to be "a fantastic expression of trust in this location".
Fujitsu is said to fit into the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greening), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed in good time by the management of the company of its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," he said to Korwis.
However, friendly contacts could not change the problems of the computer manufacturer with the real estate tenant on Marienbader-městí.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
This is now about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and the tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The Rathaus-place house that used Fujitsu so far, and the neighbouring Kleine Vertikale, together with the other buildings on the Marienbader-place, were among the most discussed building plans of the spa town.
Between the railway station and the town hall, it was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called urban entree, which was criticised both because of the massive construction of the areas that previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001 a company of investment consultancy and rating Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, moved into the house, as well as a manufacturer of Fujitsu computers, which was still related to Siemens.
In 2006, Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund acquired the buildings that Fujitsu used and sold the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concern from Tokyo is referred to as the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers, for example, computer companies and servers available and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Mohan region is one of the largest in Germany, but the most employees of Fujitsu is in Munich.
A subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, another subsidiary in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building Astro Park was rented for this purpose 7000 square meters.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the stellar plan, which is 20 years old, is also the headquarters of the central association of the electrical and electronic industries.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assangem
The Wikileaks are getting to the narrow.
Amazon Internet Service has disabled the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened on political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic depots.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, America's prominent Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is listed on Interpol's list, is to be held for one newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free speech in the free country", the activists reported the publication of short Twitter messages on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, Amazon downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic issues to handle a high number of documents.
Using Twitter, he explained to Wikileaks about this step: "Fine - our dollars will now be spent by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its Wikileaks servers after saying Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers carried out a search, published CNN television stations based on Lieberman's office information.
The Chairman of the Senate Home Defence Committee threatened Amazon with boycott, informing the British Guardian.
"I wish Amazon would have taken this step sooner, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said the senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for a platform to prevent server usage in other countries.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, obnoxiously and recklessly, and thus our national security is exposed to dangers and threatens the life of the entire planet," said one of the unbiased senators.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
Based on a report in London's "The Independent" newspaper, 39-year-old Australian in the UK, Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
The Internet activist has always referred to an investigation in Sweden as intrigues by his opponents.
The spokesman of Wikileaks Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"There were challenges to the murder of Julian Assang."
That's why Assange is rightfully worried about his safety, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked that the person responsible for publishing the Wikileaks for treason be accused and executed.
In Canada said on TV one advisor to the government leader Stephen Harper - probably ironicly, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use "target aircraft".
Meanwhile, a verbal shootout broke out between the White House and Assange.
US president Barack Obama's spokesperson Robert Gibbs called it "funny and absurd" that Assange asked for the resignation of Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently published spy challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with websites," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the safety of its databases.
The Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorism Action Centre, Russell Travers, has been appointed to the White House.
Travers has become responsible for the development of "necessary reforms in the structure", which are necessary after the publication of the messages from the embassy on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, if they should get into danger for the release on Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Philip Crowley, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice cream university
At Gelato University in Bologna, ice-cream makers are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for the future ice creamman, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors arrive from all over the world.
Where's the ice cream coming from?
Gelatier and Gelataio.
Gelatier, a Czech ice creamman, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the coolant box, wipes it in the wafer and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzol dell'Emilia in Bologna.
But who wants to learn even more about ice cream, it will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, a manufacturer of ice cream machines set up a university to match ice cream from his machines to high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors arrive from all over the world.
It also offers a few days special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in its own ice cream shop.
Someone in their Midlife-Crisis yearning for a new career, others venture to the thin ice of their unclear desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the Ice-Cream industrial country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive is not only a good taste, but also a silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training for a southern and patriotic cherries on a cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it includes a significant dose of romance."
The first step of production seems quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then it turns on the machine with a tap and flows pasteurized white base cream, the foundation of all kinds of milky ice cream.
Immediately, the professor is covered with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can you experiment yourself?
Luciano warns me to be carried away by the spirit of time to the unknown.
Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently used stabilisers - mostly natural products such as guar flour made of guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilisers, but it must be sold in one day, otherwise it collides and the customer eats all the ice grains.
Certain variations in basic matter are holidays.
It'll be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes with the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to force you a lot of aromatized ingredients."
"But you should simply experiment."
Be with the sugar and fresh fruit sorbites.
Or ice cream made of white base material that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on a base for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now he's giving the course for ice cream machines.
Luciano always lets them produce four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice creams - either with or without eggs in basic matter, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be carried out with fruity types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruity puree - due to taste it is not always better.
Nutmeg ice cream doesn't have to taste more nutmeg when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream makes a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when a balanced mixture raises the right taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a purely numerical task: If peach puree is used with lots of sugar, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
With lemon ice cream, you need extra sugar.
Luciano takes out the instrument that determines the sugar content of the fruit (the winemakers measure the must from the grapes).
Fortunately, the tables ease numbers.
Ice cream production no longer requires as much body effort as it used to be.
It does not just help the machine to produce the basic material automatically.
There is also a device that simultaneously manages the prepared ice cream and cools down to a minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will soil himself and also his colleagues from above to down with fruit puree when he gets out of control of a huge mixer.
"In every course," thinks Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Double-light auditors
The European Food Authority Efsa is linked to an industry that experimentes with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of Testbiotech experts, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the effects of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well," said the boss of the Testbiotech Christoph Then on Wednesday at Munich.
Head of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts have a contract with the Ilsi Union for several years.
This is funded by companies like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in the control regulations of Efsa for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticizing Then.
Efsa's rules are said to be in line with Ilsi's documents in the whole paragraphs, and thus carry a manuscript of the industry which should be checked by the Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech points to conflicts of interest.
Recently, a high-ranking manager from Efsa, with no allowances or transitional periods, moved to the Swiss-born Syngent Group - and thus changed parties.
The Central Germany (MDR) radio has recently revealed the EU's staffing link to the industrial lobby, which has given rise to an interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and the EU Members.
In the meantime, Efsa can't recognize a conflict of interest.
He works with all serious data, i.e. also those of industry, if they are of high professional quality, is mentioned in one statement.
Experts who work for Efsa are not required not to have contacts with the industry.
But he has to back them up.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It is referred to itself as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - among other things, to estimate the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts like Then criticise that there are currently genetically altered plants in animals without any feeding attempt, and that no genetic plant reaction to environmental effects is tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the genetically changed corn in the field will do," says Then.
Current practice is only testing isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If they're not looking for risks, how can they be found?" he asks Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with that.
A researcher has been studying gentechnics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University in Zurich.
As in the US, industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who would not be connected to the companies.
Most of the time, studies that are critical for companies are not published.
"Industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
Track of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of a station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
She was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September the bagels arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the station.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
It's broken into 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim limestone, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured several of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
It's like, "Hand and poor stone, simple and original."
When he cut one, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
So is Uli Gsell.
The trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen to the former depository of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all of them that were created during the Stuttgart riot.
"It would be a shame if they broke down on a gravel or disappeared on a depository," says the wooden box, which was a former guard house.
They told him that they were swearing and threatening him when in September all the newspapers said he had bought the remains of the northern wing from a company that was carrying out the demolition.
But he's been talking to S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he wasn't responsible for the demolition.
And now that that's happening, it's the most reasonable thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21 opponents every one about 80 kilograms heavy block, price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also hope to return it in the re-building.
Rongen bought 500 tons, cargo of 25 big trucks.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest sold out a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from every corner and towed what was in the trunk and on the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long since turned into "colds" or the edges of beds with herbs.
"This stone isn't really anything special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political plug."
He's getting into his field car and he's going for a 20-acre ride.
He studied law first, discontinued study, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
And a stone lover.
He's got 40,000 tons of stones stored.
It will bind its treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old-stone dealer in the Republic.
It's brittle.
In the snow lies the artisticly worked sandstone.
"One of them belonged on the Marian-bridge in Dresden," he says.
The sandstone from Labe, yellow, warm, is excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're on our way up through the woods.
Pointed to a pile: a red sandstone, formerly part of a station in Karlsruhe.
Come on.
"Nice travertine."
They once belonged to the Neckarstadion Tribune in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow there are stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police Presidium in Stuttgart, red garnet from the temple of Sankt Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be broken by hand and transported by simple pulleys and bull carriages, it becomes a total honor.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were to be crushed."
He didn't become rich, he didn't become very rich at all.
But today, the stone dealer employs 14 people, and in addition, stonestones, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener have settled up in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the remains.
He must be in Cologne in the near future.
Rocks will be saved there, too.
The Fight of Talents for High-Potentials
There's a lot of people at the snacks.
16 students press the bread with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the students of engineering and design to the workshop.
Together with VW developers, they are supposed to talk about the car of the future - and just to get to know Volkswagen by the way.
Many companies try to compete for the smartest heads, as well as VW, succeed and bet on co-operation with universities.
Their mission is: as soon as possible to recruit the most talented graduates in the auditoriums, even before they get on the labour market and will be interested in them.
Since universities do not issue any lists of the successes of their students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in and get them.
At TU Braunschweig tries to win the car company talents the next day.
One young lady in the personal department is handing out pens, rubber teddy bears and VW plates.
It tells promising young talents about programs of practice, student jobs and suggests their travels to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see benefits for both parties: "Students will come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"The VW can meet students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates and figure out who would be useful as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is, he fights so openly for students.
"Otherwise, it was a major professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably get harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from long crowds of applicants.
On the contrary, they must strive and try to attract particularly highly qualified labour.
In particular, graduates of engineering have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German VDI Association of Engineers, 40,000 positions remain vacant in October.
And according to the predictions of the VDI, the so-called lack of engineers will continue to grow.
Roman Dykta is behind the audit and consulting firm KPMG to hunt talent.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
Participants can also visit KPMG branches and familiarize themselves with the company.
Before that, he will decide in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many interested will fly to the USA.
In the battle for the High Potentials at universities, they will apply increasingly hard laws according to the Dicts.
"We want to distinguish ourselves with our Race from the others."
"The easy trip to the sailboat was too little for us."
Seems like Dicta's talent hunter is lucky.
"We stayed in contact with all participants of similar events last year."
"Some will soon finish their studies and plan to apply for a job with us," he says.
In addition to direct contacting the campus, mainly small and medium-sized companies present on the labour markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"For example, at Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, head of the personnel department of the solar technology producer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
At present, 35 positions are published on the company website.
"Now it's just complicated to take seats."
"It's a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, e.g. the University of Freiberg.
"Professors report that it is possible for us to do a practice or write a thesis."
The solar specialist does not hold any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"Big companies often cannot offer this," says the head of the personal department of Stübe.
Money no longer plays a major role in finding work.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good procedures are other decisive factors.
Solarworld occupied in one study the Institute Great Place to Work 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and follow the framework conditions of employees.
The head of the personal department of Stübe hopes that the location will bring points to the jobseekers.
"I believe that the interested parties are particularly informed about the external evaluations of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to see yourself as an attractive employer is through your own employees," he says.
This is referred to as Internal Employer Branding, i.e. the enforcement of an employer on the market within its own employees.
"The satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they advertise their employer between friends and acquaintances themselves.
"It's like a string game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil wells
During the following years, no new oil wells will be created outside the US Commonwealth State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The D.C. Government has issued a corresponding ban - and thus lifted the earlier plans with final effect.
New drillings are also prohibited before the Atlantic coast.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar said Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling tower in April.
Before this disaster, which cost 11 workers their lives and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signaled against the pressure of the opposition and industry's willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
In doing so, the US is trying to reduce its dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To date, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The center of criticism is the British power company BP, which is confronted with billion-dollar applications.
The investigation committee entrusted by Obama should present the results during December.
In October, the Home Secretary, Ken Salazar, abolished the drilling ban, which was applicable since the explosion.
Subsequently, different oil companies submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent such a disaster by more stringent controls and strict security regulations.
Currently, the audit authority is essentially reforming itself, which has highlighted many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would abolish the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas companies.
The industry now warns openly that more stringent regulation will substantially reduce the volume of oil in the Gulf.
" Government plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the gas and oil industry", is the result of a current survey in the field of consultancy company BDO - before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance also complains about uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what the regulation will change."
Investments in new mining projects are shifting until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The area of Ogoni burned down
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of leaked oil destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People do the stealing, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," calms the journalism environmental activist: "Today you'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens."
A 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who's wailing on his breasts with water that surrounds the smudges: the scene acts in water gloss with rainbow colors almost nicely.
The fact that brown oil clots swim beneath the surface is not visible.
She used to collect enough garnel into the vessels, says Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water has become completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil was poured into a huge wet area from a broken leadership.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to get to the waters where fish are: the Ogoni region, which is located in the heart of the Niger delta, is one of the worst infested areas in the world.
On the river, mangrove marshes with lots of side tributaries are only visible the whole range of the trigger.
The boat engine boils brown mash instead of light water, and whoever puts his hand in the water pulls out oil fingers.
Mangrove roots are drawn from the ground like black poles of licorice, rare palm trees leave their leaves hanging sadly.
In vain, we seek flocks of birds that normally occur in wet areas: Once the engine on the boat is silent, they will be comforted in the former paradise, where it smells like a pump, scary silence.
"What is happening here is the ecological direction of war," says sadly Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear for health."
A comparison to a war is justified.
The area of Ogoni's settlement is a battlefield where several decades have fought: over 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe came here, here in the 1980s formed the first resistance with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here had to stop his production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while it is daily benefiting from the entire delta area of three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometres of lead of more than two million barrels of black gold, oil fields in the Ogoni Lady area lie too unstable for the company.
Every few hundred meters are drawn from the water of the steel structure as bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so too delicately called the heads of drilling holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusty.
Any minute, such a drilling hole head breaks, tells Akpobari, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres in 50 years have been leaked into the ecosystem in the delta: Each year, the amount of oil that has leaked into the sea in Alaska in the event of a supertanker accident "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There is a dispute that is still responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell refers to sabotage and organised oil theft as more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists refer to the cracking well heads and leaky leads as the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than in the world, said the group in 2008 US-American scientist Richard Steiner: Only the number of leads disorders is "sometimes higher than elsewhere".
At a place that looks like deserted from a distance, oil - soiled workshop under the wide sky comes from the mangroves of the figure: they are completely naked and up to the neck of the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly linked by the lead, partially scattered on the ground, fire: illegal small refineries.
Oil in the barrel over the fire warms for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First it leaks out of the line to the capture pot of gasoline, later it drips at the end of the kerosene line and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four coworkers make up to four barrels of 300 liters a day: "We'll make 34.000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
Delta dwellers use chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria only owns one refineries.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents Euro per litre of diesel can still be used by illegal producers: because they have free raw material.
It comes from "bunkers" who connect to the leadership in the Ogoni area: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost daily in the entire Niger delta area.
But only a negligible small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally entrenched: the largest share will be filled by organised criminal networks, which include politicians and high-ranking military leaders, tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate on whether the population and their intervention or lax production have caused a disaster is regarded as purely academic by the activist Akpobari.
"If oil companies hadn't been considered an intruder and if they hadn't completely destroyed the nature of fishermen's lives, there wouldn't be either sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell is so damaged that it only takes into account the departure of the group: "Maybe other nations will show up as Chinese as better."
Michael's gonna get anxious.
"It's time for you to disappear," says the muscle producer.
"The soldiers can come at any moment."
If a special military unit finds them, they may not be in jail, but they may be in a painful bribe.
Also, soldiers, who usually come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"This cursed thing got our ground in all respects to the bottom," says Akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous construction error in A380 engines
A380 seems to have a major security defect.
The investigators discovered a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastrophaal engine failure" during a search for a machine that has accidentally landed.
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas airbus passengers were probably more fortunate at an emergency landing at the beginning of November than was known: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a major safety defect on the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and now warns against a possible construction error.
The damage may have severe consequences: there could be cracks on one oil connection due to wear, and this Thursday was heard in a published statement by the ATSB.
This could lead to "catastrophatic engine failure".
These are engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the airbus of Qantas, which had to land in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It referred the ground for a complaint before the Australian Federal Court of Sydney, which allows further legal action against that company.
The head of Qantas Alan Joyce said that his company would claim compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, the parts released and damaged the bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce described burning oil as causing damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be switched around the world.
The Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with giant aeroplanes equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiencies were considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of Qantas, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a safety measure.
Two-story aircraft is the largest passenger plane in the world.
The national snowing causes chaos in transport
Germany all white: almost all over the country snowed overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, connection of trains and aircraft is being disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Freezing Germany: almost the entire Republic fell on Thursday night at freezing temperatures in the snow - leading in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and east, it lies in some places up to 15 centimeters of snow.
There is a lot of traffic on several motorways and many roads.
On A7 at Flensburg, the road service was still in use, but it did not manage the new snow.
In addition, there was still a strong wind of impact above the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Shipping and Hydrography (BSH) awaits the Baltic Sea coast in Schlesvik-Holstein in the morning a turbulent flood with a water state of 1.2 metres above normal.
Snow veils caused considerable problems in Saxony on motorways and national roads.
According to the center of bad weather Meteomedia was therefore the highest level of alarm in Saxon Switzerland.
From part of it it attacked 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused the winds.
There were several freight and passenger cars left at night.
Police authorities also reported major road problems in Saxony-Anhaltia.
On A2 caused wind and snow to slow traffic and congestion.
There were troubles in Thurinsk because of the snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German Railway, there are great difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Durinland and Northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken top guides and switches.
Remote traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped in Saxony.
In Duryn Saalfeld, one ICE had to stop to Munich.
165 passengers received wool blankets, food and drink on the train from firemen and paramedics.
The snow wind is rolling over the road.
Many flights were cancelled at large German airports because of the snow winds.
According to the spokesman of the headquarters for information on flights has already been reported from Munich cancelled flights.
In Frankfurt nach Mohan, 40 flights have been cancelled according to the Fraport spokesman.
Road maintenance is in constant deployment.
There are only a few passengers left at the airport without connections, but 400 field beds are ready for them.
There have been accidents on many roads already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holland.
The engineer was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred due to the snowy road near Nuremberg: there was also a truck caught at the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the morning.
And then a 30-year-old woman died after she turned over to the slippery road at Aschaffenburg with her car.
The meteorologists, however, have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light snow, and that is why it will rise even in light gusts of the wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only at the Baltic Sea will the rapid winds of the storm.
But it's going to be a big winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank looking for buyers for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper paper, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could amount to up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just refurbished its headquarters: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have upgraded; in the meantime, the bankers have been allowed to re-enter their old jobs.
Now, however, apparently the financial company wants to renovate again - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, as reported by the Financial Times Deutschland with appeal to the spokesman.
The speaker did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are constantly examining whether it is more meaningful to own or sell and then rent again," he said.
The largest credit institution in Germany is giving up its corporate headquarters once again after a short time.
The bank took over the twin towers only in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from its investors and subsequently refurbished them cost-effectively.
Energy reconstruction has swallowed around EUR 200 million according to data.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper text, experts estimate the value of the redesigned towers to "Greenovers" at a price of around EUR 500 million.
The speaker said it is not decided whether the building will be sold again to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for dead miners
More than 10,000 people honored the memory of buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
Still, the dead have not been released because the safety situation continues to be complicated in the shaft.
Almost two weeks ago, a massive explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were flooded in the mine.
The shaft, where there was an accident, was launched, but there was no sign of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, emergency forces could not descend due to safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts were based on the fact that the miners had no chance of survival.
Still no release of the dead.
They now honored the memory of dead relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand in sunny weather.
They've been silent for two minutes.
29 tables, helmets, lamps and miners were built to honor the memory of buried miners.
Also pictures and personal items, such as clothes and surfboards have found their place here.
There were flags at the government buildings, half-jokes.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would again come out of the "hlobin of the country" to the surface, said the Ministerial President of New Zealand John Key to the participants of the memorial event.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrence Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the memorial event.
During the explosion on November 19, British and South African miners were also flooded.
The rescuers began by extinguishing the fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the toxic gases dissolve, it starts to cool down the high temperatures inside the mine, the police president Gary Knowles told the journalist.
To hell, warriors!
Does a horror movie fit?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to conquer the old border with his battle epic "Wallalla Rising".
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he was filming "Walhalla Rising"?
The captured Viking fighter with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be freed from his warlords and in the large he kills almost with the supernatural power of his opponents - it sounds perfect for young men looking for a blood action, because our hero helps himself with cruel killing methods and even breaks the guts of his enemies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One-Eye, as it is actually called, will not say a word during the whole film, and the other characters will give at most one or two sentences, or will be torn down to the most pitiful dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and rotting in the horribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very calm footage of the camera.
It's good when a movie has multiple target groups, it's just a shame that they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about "Pusher" drug dealers, is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantin, but he is stoically resisting to bring his works closer to either the humor of the mainstream or to a less brutal artistic audience.
Most of the fans of the art cinema are likely to be discouraged by the spraying brains and guts everywhere.
The supporters of action films shall be bored not later than when the One Eye sets out for explanatory reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries ships to Jerusalem and shall remain silent for eternity in the wind and fog until the men may sail to America and remain silent there.
It is therefore no wonder that in Germany "Wallhalla Rising" did not go to the cinemas and was now released only on DVD.
It's a shame mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind a distinctive facade, places to the broken blood, it hides an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
In this film, it's not about dialogue or the exact story, everything is about the atmosphere, a feverish dream that has become a movie.
And it's not for the viewer to escape.
Refn does not give him a moment of relaxation and slowly suffocate him with his frosty shots and a cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, above all, with indescribable hatred that emanates from the heart of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who helps One-Eye keeps something like innocence, everyone else driven by anger.
Of all the most one-eyed heroes whose motives will never be explained, which will become a time for enemies and transitory warriors from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil.
It represents destruction, but perhaps only for the corrupt ones.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired for anger, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious Earthwork
The IAEA has a new warning about a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is resisting expression - and it won't even allow control.
Around midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli fighters F-15 I will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of Euphrate; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometres away and its name is Dair as-Saur.
The documents of the International Office for Nuclear Energy (IAEA) reveal its name when it is a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in the valley, which turns from the current.
On the basis of a message from the US-American foreign intelligence service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well thrown into the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The tech from the 1950s is no good for anything else.
The CIA was presenting a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, she explained where the reactor components could have been before they were destroyed, it is a reduced copy of the North Korean nuclear centre model Yongbyon.
In addition, there were still photographs that showed the building close to or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been shortly before the launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years of bombing, they don't know much more than they did at that time, even puzzles got bigger in time.
The former US president George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that the CIA was very confident before the attack that Syria was building in the el-Kibar reactor, but basically had no evidence that there was a "active nuclear weapon program" in the country.
Some secret service rapporteurs in Europe are even more careful and speak only of a 'supposed reactor', even though the CIA's presentation considers it 'faithful'.
They lack clear evidence, just like the IAEA.
When asked how sure he had a reactor in front of him, he answered a high diplomat UN in the summer, the IAEA said he had "a lack of material to ask questions".
The rubble of "unused military buildings" was quickly removed, and also properly leveled the terrain.
Yet, in June 2008, the IAEA team was found under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in the el-Kibar uranium footprints, which was produced by humans.
In addition, via a Member State, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial sellers from the time immediately after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market because they are exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program, nor has it built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But that's refuted by the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss matters as well as satellite footage.
In addition, the auditors banned a second inspection at el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment", confirmed recently the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at that time.
The investigation of this case has been going on without result since June 2008 and "is growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office", as admitted by a high Western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna - it is a serious breach of the nuclear-weapon treaty that the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers it the key to progress in the matter of another three devices to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, they still exist.
In doing so, the auditors have not yet mentioned which equipment is involved, or what function they have or why they are suspected.
According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA is referred to internally as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived again from nearby cities.
An independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a complex of buildings on satellite imagery, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason Syria refuses to access the IAEA to these three places.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the UAEA would be a pre-deposited U.S. to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence and satellite images that between these three places and the square near Euphrate the material was transported here and there.
In Vienna he said a high Western diplomat that at least one equipment should be "in connection with fuel production".
But there are no "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from, and where it should later break out the plutonium on the bomb, there are only likely estimates of these central issues.
It is also unknown whether the debris that might hide important traces are stored in these three places.
As if hundreds of freight wagons have disappeared from the surface of the earth, no one seems to have any information about where the rubble went.
Only a few kilometres from the el-Kibar remote and on the other hand, the salt mine of al-Tibni, which had Syria checked in 1998 as a suitable storage facility for radioactive waste, considers the IAEA unlikely.
Former inspector Robert Kelley put him in touch with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned journal Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the images from the universe show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out all the suspicious places of earthwork and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear up the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles speak of the fact that the IAEA has spent many months developing a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep possible military secrets - only the effort shows how much the interest of auditors is.
In the meantime, Damascus has rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats were calming down in Vienna a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, and that's why this thing is not on fire, Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about the so-called special inspections for several months, one of the toughest means the Vienna nuclear office has to carry out controls.
The head of the IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already talked about "the possibilities to which I am leaning in the future", but so far he is hesitant.
This choice offers a great risk: on the one hand, a majority on the IAEA Governing Council is needed, and many of the 35 countries are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat warns, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love in Wartime
Since Angelina Jolie began to work on the still nameless pre-primary principal in the summer, there have been difficulties.
She herself wrote a script, it's the love story of a woman from Bosnia and Herzegovina and a man from Serbia.
There's much more to know - but it's also causing unrest.
It is constantly said that the woman who is Muslim will fall in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnia women's associations protested immediately, so the planned shooting from Sarajevo to Hungary moved quickly.
Meanwhile, the film has finished in Hungary and is in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women's War Sacrifices wrote through the UN-organizations to assist the refugees of UNHCR Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, they have now informed the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also the ambassador of the UN-organization to help refugees.
It is not exactly diplomatic - she offered women meetings in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, she said Hasecic.
At the rape camps, love stories were not done, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims reveals a lot about the script.
Her organization therefore recommended the UN organization to assist refugees to release Jolie as ambassador, informs the Guardian.
What scene did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnia Ministry of Culture, which was given to read her script, allowed filming after minor moves in Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come after all.
The young author points out that in her film she has no political intentions, that she has devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all the parties involved.
Given the content, it remains indefinite.
There's another version of a movie that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the war started, and they'll meet again when she's like a Bosnian Muslim dragged into a Serbian camp where she serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds a lot different than "the rape victim will fall in love with his master."
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war is true.
Jolie argues that there is a pressure on her that "is not fair and is based on misinformation".
They can now free them from Hollywood: By publishing illegally on the Internet her script, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone
This evening is once again good for the Irish.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates much over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans scream with joy for the sound of loud music, butt-footed.
Bailey-Pub is boiling in Cork, South, because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and hit each other.
The beer pong is called the bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning bonus and to do so tickets to Las Vegas at the World Cup in beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this screaming beer game and a restraining informer, it's not very good together.
Still, a 26-year-old man tries to have fun, to get away from the harsh question of what the future will bring.
His plan isn't playing passion in Las Vegas, he's on his way to an interview in New Zealand in January.
"I have a weird feeling about it," she says.
"It's so far away, and I don't have a job."
Yet: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "in an instant she gained her dream job as an Event manager, maybe it is a good sign", says the young man and smiles.
Two out of three Tanner siblings tried their luck abroad because of their poor prospects at home.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT advisor in London.
The boys are leaving: just like the Tanners, it looks in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people leave the country in the foreseeable future, predict experts from the Institute for Economics and Social Affairs of ESRI in Dublin.
They count even by 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar emigration wave that Ireland suffered in the 1980 ’ s.
After decades of rise, which brought great prosperity to the Irish people, dissatisfaction is now expanding again.
In particular, the economic crisis is affecting young, educated Irish people who have so far only experienced a rise.
Loss of employment and social descent seemed absurd in these years.
Everyone needed it, the money was too much.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men under 30 are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters of readers who complain: "Everything goes downhill in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - who can, he goes away and our country loses its generation."
"The last one please turn off the lights."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees the future in black, because the government says it only deceives and offers young people no prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
She observes her classmates moving from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move out alone in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the subject in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers an overall service on the subject of work abroad.
"For beginners on the labour market, work abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website are photographs of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
What it's like to build something else for six months, Seán O'Donovan.
Since 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed together with 15 Irish colleagues at the construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works extra shifts so he can pay home a house loan.
"The situation is sometimes a little crazy," he says, when the first time in a long time it crosses the threshold of its own house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm not in at all."
He laughs in despair and walks in cold rooms.
A small house is located in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, and large expensive cars are parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for EUR 380,000 - 100 percent funded by the loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it wouldn't have to go well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, he's pouring hot tea and he says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The construction engineer doesn't like the wailing he hears so often now.
"Nobody has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who went to England in the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back again, and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keeping an open future and simply waiting for life to evolve elsewhere.
He has also been working in London for several years, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one more thing that concerns him very much these days: a celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might go wrong for a bachelor party.
"Mostly no emotion," he says, "and he drinks a lot of beer."
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a leaving party, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common practice of democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing as well as the promotion of private entrepreneurship.
Criminal activity raises greater concerns than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current survey of Latinobarómetro, which took place in 18 countries and came out exclusively in The Economist magazine.
As the survey has been taking place regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the whole area.
This year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, dominates two related issues.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase stability in attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
The promotion of democracy in several countries at the edge of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has been on average 6% a year since 2002, the promotion of democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where economics recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of the surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are convinced Democrats, which withdraws the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents across the whole area were satisfied with how democracy operates in practice in their country, it is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001 when it was 25%, it is a large increase (graph 3).
Approximately 34% said that they trusted the Parliament in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same figures as last year, but it was a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America undermined the economic crisis.
The support was probably created during the global financial crisis because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin American people living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
However, the mood is changing in a wide range from country to country (see graph 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President Luiz Inácia Lula da Silva are reflected in a widely accepted sense for progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and worsened the state of violent crime.
It is only the second time since surveys began that more respondents across Latin America have seen crime as the most important problem than unemployment (see Figure 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or their close relatives were victims of crime last year, but that is a decrease compared to 38% of last year's figures and is also the lowest figure since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private business and market economy: around 71% of respondents across the whole area say that private business is essential for development, this percentage increased from 56% of 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow the development of their country, this percentage increased from 47% of last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered to be the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised Options
No one expected the general elections to be perfect in Haiti on 28 November.
But they were much worse than outsiders who were trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
The elections were filled with urns and repeated votes, ballots scattered over channels, broken electoral rooms and intimidation.
The election room is open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many moved because of the January earthquake, were wandering around trying to find out where they could vote.
Some of them finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several supposed predecessors, shouted that it was a fraud and called after the election was cancelled.
The protests, some of them violent in nature, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, stated that "it was a pretty good choice in many respects."
The observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community carefully said that 'they do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they were, did not necessarily have to break the process'.
In other words, the show continues.
The election authority, whose opposition votes are bound by René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All the electoral hopes aren't lost.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martella, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, resigned from their original call for a vote to be void.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has small or negligible support among the voters, is designated by the electoral committee for having achieved a decisive battle.
Because of the cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there was a concern that the voter would be low.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization, they were prevented.
Around 250 000 identity cards that are necessary for the vote remained undivided shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
So it's clear the Haitians will settle for it themselves.
Tops to the center
In weeks when she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, Argentina’s president, has benefited from public sympathy, when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Nevertheless, the reversing of this success in a successful campaign for the second term of office in the next year may depend on whether the grieving Mrs Fernández gives up the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs, everything will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued his economic policy after his wife had successfully become president, was in the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend more income as they please.
Mrs Fernández's government lost most last year in Congress.
But the opposition split up and was further destabilized at the death of Mr Kirchner for a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement have joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (which there was a clapping and accusation of government corruption), Congress could not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for next year, with the President spending more space as he pleases.
The economy is overheating: this year growth is likely to be as high as 9%.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unions are talking about the number that is close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina suffered economic collapse, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleansed the INDEC, a statistical agency that had taken up monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
She called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And her officials say they want to reduce wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by a rise in world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
That may be why Madam President Fernández is letting us know that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government created an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
She is now facing President Fernández's deal with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be supervised by the IMF as usual.
But last month Amado Boudo, the Minister of Economy announced that the fund would provide a "technical assistance" in order to propose a new national consumer-price index, which would remind of the introduction to the cleaning of INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether Mrs Fernández will want to stay in politics after her term of office, when her husband is no longer with her.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get the support of a middle class that is tired of Kirchnerism.
By the time the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If he wants to win the next election, he will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to give up the many opinions her husband held in politics quietly.
Half-incentive to China
Taiwan's voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of their big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, voted on 27 November by the mayor and the city council in five urban districts, which may be considered a wider evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeu.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail in the mainland and have a strong foundation in business relations, including the agreement on partly free trade, in the biggest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but only close.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayors, she could not win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favour of greater independence of Taiwan, has won almost 50% of all votes against the 45% KMT party.
If this was a presidential election, the President would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote rate has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP side was together with KMT in city councils.
The elections took place like most of the Taiwanese elections, which included noisy election lorries and mass gatherings with flags with sparsely dressed girls.
There was even a mandatory mystery attempt to assassinate.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was agitated for the KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien straight through his face, hurt him and killed a viewer.
It was not bizarre whether the armed man intended to hurt Mr. Lien or to settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, suspected falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Perhaps China was the only big campaign winner.
It was remarkable how the question of land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates went beyond the plans for civil housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
The KMT therefore tends to avoid ties to the Beijing government.
But this time, DPP also dropped off anti-China attitudes.
It is a reaction to the fact and to the realization that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
President Ma confirmed to his side that China's policy is acceptable to the majority of Taiwan.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue its commercial bribes, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste its time sending a negotiator to Taipej to set up a summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
I'm sure they'd also like to see political integration, but first things first.
That's better wait after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP side has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on the basis of corruption charges.
President in 2000-08 was a rebel and advocate of clear independence.
But Mrs. Tsai has developed a new generation that is moderate and DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been called as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr Chen.
Their party is now doing everything it can to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a point of contact between DPP and China, provided that their actions can take place without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai informs the Taiwanese public that her party is a "trustible alternative" to Mr Ma's hastily approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed his view that DPP candidates would be better off insisting that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
The evaluation of Mr Ma was poor, despite the extreme pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
His distrust seems to be based mainly on unemployment and a growing gap between the rich and the poor.
KMT spokesman says he'll reorganize his cabinet, as well as the local offices.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan to establish friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration to be inevitable with China.
According to Antonia Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has passed."
Nomination on Grammy Prize: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
The performance at the request of the President and the people must be aware.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer whom President Obama chose to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is referred to as one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a nomination in the category of the best new artist.
Since Spalding was a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008 when her album "Esperanza", the nomination came a little late, but it is in accordance with the Grammy rules when an artist must not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is determined."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly recorded a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and an immersive hand with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success that Norah Jones, the closest equivalent to the Grammy voters, who have been looking for a similar jazz work in this category over the last few years.
Other judges of Grammy rightly appreciate the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, exciting, refreshing ride of the album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by experienced saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley "Positotly."
Trombone Shorty, a Christish favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on the HBO "Trem" series was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise favored by the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of the steampunk has won several well-deserved recognition in the category of large files, where the competition was the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octave "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how the bassist can have his free hand as a bandmate.
Nomination Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in the category of classical music
Nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at 53rd annual Grammy Awards.
The leader of the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with a number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work with three points.
The Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", which was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance to appreciate.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producers of the year has five nominees, such as Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As regards the category of opera, the nominees are Berg and Lulu by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and Marc Antonio e Cleopatra by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saaria and L'Amour de Loin by Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are nominated to Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
Approximately 30 minutes' work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and Mandolin Concerto were nominated for the instrumental performance of the soloist with the orchestra.
The L.A. composer stated that he wrote a 15-minute work especially for the mandoline artist Avi Avitalo, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"I wrote it using notes from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a phone conversation.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for leading the Chicago Symphony while recording Stravinsky's work.
The instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists, only women were represented this year, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of transition classics, soprano Jessye Norman won the nomination for her record "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula is approved by the planning committee
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of often passionate public witness.
The critics attacked the project that it was promoting terrorism and that it would lead to a suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"Those who oppose are just shouting out loud."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The meeting started at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost midnight, when most of the time it took to discuss with people who were for or against the centre.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no more America," one comment appeared.
"We're a planet of monkeys with the Statue of Liberty that fits into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also launched protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, a place of tragedy that took place on 11 September 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
He condemned violence in Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush.
His religious community, which had approximately 135 families, lived in Riverside County for years without an incident, but wished for a bigger and more suitable space than the storage space that he rented along with the filter system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24 943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to 43 feet.
It should take a place of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparal High School.
The opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new life types on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the space for finding new life forms on Earth and perhaps further.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has possibilities that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and fundamental.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either by phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that it is a form of truly 'alternative' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies from Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
For a long time, six main elements were considered essential for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulphur.
However, scientists found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, were able to continue to grow after the arsenic replaced with phosphorus.
"You will begin to wonder what is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life may look like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the report published in order to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the find, caused broad speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not that.
The discovery " indicates that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the set of elements that we consider to be 'standard' may not be so essential for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA Astrobiology Institute, who conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arzen and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so it considered that microb, which is exposed to both elements, may be able to replace one after the other.
"Arzen is poisonous mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hard separate these elements."
"However, arsenic is so different that it doesn't work like phosphorus. When it gets into the organism, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better with phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility that the life-form that uses arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant to microbiology at the University of Florida, stated that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but never found an example to prove this.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that he could be used by previous forms of life.
"This suggests that there could have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early period of Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The other stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four dog shows someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found reporting to the Los Angeles Sheriff on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two akits and a large pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, told the authorities.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs were left on Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, spokesperson of the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, where they were located, nor did he share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," said Whitmore.
"We follow the rules."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught to comment on the case.
They were very happy to find their two akits at a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's attorneys found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old Trace and a 10-month-old Didi bitch, were unharmed, told the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek breed, who planned to participate this week in regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unfounded until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs were to compete in other competitions, scheduled on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, said Peek of The Times on Wednesday.
South California is only one stop at almost a month's travel couple after dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard signed up for a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car outside the window of the room.
They also took with them three dogs - boxer's puppy, Parson Russell Terrier, and the Bretany fireman - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little bit so the dogs would have enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car theft at 6:00 A.M. Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who led them to missing dogs, dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It was not clear on Thursday whether the prizes would be awarded.
The lion is ready to shout again now that the restructuring of MGM receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got a green light to start over.
On Thursday, Federal Insolvency Judge officially blessed the "prepackaged" creditors' plan to offset about $5 billion in debt and thus clear the way for a 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on production and production of movies and television shows.
A Thursday's return that the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy rules remains a legal obstacle to re-start the founder of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main leaders of the thinning studio.
The number of employees decreases to approximately 320 of the original more than 400.
The MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has agreed on planned financial resources allowing a loan of $500 million to finance new operations and production of MGM.
Now it's a merger with an investment bank, which itself needs $75 million, and funding is expected around half of December.
The restructuring process of the study started in May 2009, when Moelis & Co. had been hired to advise management on how to solve its finances, as management fought to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
On August that year, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and an expert on turnover, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After a few months of discussion, the parties agreed to sell the company at the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several interested parties, none of them was willing to pay $2 billion plus the money requested by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditor at the end of October.
When MGM officially rises from the audition in the coming weeks, Moeise and Cooper will receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will be paid $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who collect $375,000 a month for their services that run the company, will receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restore production in MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films, the title of which will be the book "Hobit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of these two films directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debts, sought the possibility of merging the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
The technological toys that keep your budget balanced for gifts
The leading candidate of this year is the most amazing iPad toy followed by a video game system. However, in both cases it is a significant intervention in the budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX wheels for $99 and one Kinect game costs just like 10 beads or about 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your budget balanced for gifts.
I recently visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us a BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law was working; this year's technological toys have much more energy, at the same prices, if not a little lower, compared to previous years.
While relatively less new toys have appeared with associated sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increased as are toys with chargers.
Here's some recommendations.
(All listed prices are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their bellies.
At one click, the animal makes a tone, and the other push starts to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
You can't stop once you start pushing.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60$, from 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animator doll from Elmo Live Technology that can play Simon Says and can walk for a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel blocking.
The kids are testing Mickey's dance instructor's toy, although their parents are complaining about a lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you might remember Alfie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from the age of 3), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed so that driving a car turns into a fun job with a self-repaired, funny workbook.
If you're sneaking around the smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
In Tech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years old) this is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboard, although the games do not have as effective a lesson as the Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years old), the first significant Leapster series change from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with the older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years old) uses iTunes-like to introduce games and e-books and has a SD card slot that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, the Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children from the age of 8) is a set of five cubes that are not bigger than a matchbox, each with an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing cubes in a row before time runs out; it is great for competition in improvized word formation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented in toy shops.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2. Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits from Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or the Puffle pet.
A little bit bigger than the brush of your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years old), the latest in a series of microrobots for a button battery.
The bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's funny to make a maze out of cubes and see if he can find a way out.
He's also very durable.
Ours was able to fall down with the kitchen table and spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
Introduction of finer police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlled his orders, and issued orders in a court of law with military authority.
He wanted women's members - China's brave enforcers of urban order, feared and despised for their hard actions and liking violence - to convey a certain impression on the depths of the surrounding.
"Stand straight!"
Hurry up!
Show them, whispering quietly, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood up.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as by a ruler.
Four headgear fit perfectly on the hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"I personally think they look average," said Mr Tang.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered the new goalkeepers to have a college education.
Guangdong Province has turned grey-green uniforms into supposedly more attractive blue.
In Central China, Wuhan replaced the views of strong arms: in 2009 it was stated that 50 officers were encircled by a snack cart and looked intently at the owners until the home seller packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose surgery as the main picture.
Since 2003, the county has supplemented its city police with 13 women who have been selected specifically for their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The goal is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, a softer female side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have difficulty getting into secret Chinese city groups.
The critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce a city decree, impose fines and other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media commonly captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei beat a non-participating viewer to death after using his cell phone to shoot, as they started in the procedure of protesting the landfill.
Last year, police training took place in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual described, among other things, how to effectively beat the perpetrators without signs of blood.
This year, a melon merchant in Shanghai got himself into a fight with five police officers and suffered injuries to the left side of the brain.
One video game, which can be downloaded online, depicts Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, lamented last year after another discussion on tactics.
The paper said "really thoroughly cleaned."
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised interest in eight new female police officers in October, the introduction of The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district required female candidates between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good character and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height greater than the diameter - that is, higher than 1.6 meters.
Extinction at the age of 26 is mandatory.
The shareholders claim that work is too psychologically demanding for women over 25 years of age.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unappointed police officer at Rednet.com, as if government websites.
"The candidates must first demonstrate the external quality, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the nature and "internal quality".
Women are like flower vases, he said and added, "In addition to being vases, they will also have different responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of County Management, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that height requirements in China are also common for other jobs, both sexes.
As well as requiring a uniform facial trait.
Which means that the question of good insight is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
The medical disability or mutilation will certainly not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or scaly man to serve with us," Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps watch at Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like apples and softly shaped mouth.
She doesn't think that the emphasis on her appearance could be sexualistic, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her coworker with dolls, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our job is to represent the city's image."
They do not object to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than merely to drive traders into alleys where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning, there is a group against more than ten marketers running on foot or on bikes trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu before they are banished.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Miss Xu when the marketer started running, and for a while he left his bike with a noodle cart.
The police describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day is basically the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in her free marketing.
"Big routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the authority as their male counterparts so that they can confiscate the goods to the sellers.
They can only threaten to report the matter to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the Yunnan province, rebelled after false rumors had spread about the police killing of the seller.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night; 14 government vehicles were knocked over or lit.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baoguang Square, where the police officer was patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The cops confiscated a motorcycle that repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store as required by regulations.
The bike owner could cry like he wanted.
15 minutes' distance from the police, looking rabid, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator assigned to the male group, remained behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintaining and smoothing the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"We sometimes fight physically," said Mr. Li.
"Mostly, it's the public who starts it."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of a criminal charge concerning his affair with the former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, announced on Wednesday to the senator's lawyers.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, a Nevadan, faced, and which, until the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair became national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said that he was "comforted" by a decision that followed almost a year's investigation.
The Senator could still face disciplinary proceedings with the Senate's ethical committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the subject of an investigation and that it is not planned to press further charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department has refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, of the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a cashier in the Ensign campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr Hampton and to support their views after they hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, so much are given by documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was until recently Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was voted out of lobbying his former employer or Senate for a year.
The ethics experts claim that Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton's unusual settlements, who were friends before the affair, have appeared contrary to the lobbying ban.
From the evidence that was published "it turned out that this was a clear case of preparation of the violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the matter of Senator Ensign, Mr Brand and other lawyers with a specialisation in ethics said that the Ministry was cautious in terms of political actions, after a large number of failures, including last year's decision to suspend the lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens in the midst of a mistrial of the state's attorney.
Federal prosecutors "have clearly hidden their weapons," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a legal group that has filed several complaints against Mr Ensign on the case.
"This basically points to the fact that high-ranking government officials are not subject to laws," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's chief lawyer, told him that he had been called by the D.A. of Justice on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the Ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in the Wednesday declaration, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins has refused to specify the legal arguments he passed on to the prosecutors.
"I'm not happy to present the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop the investigation of a separate complaint in which the ethical group accused the payment of Ensign Hampton's parents of $96.000 in violation of the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that there was not enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbyist job was NV Energy, the main company in Nevada that long supported the senator.
One e-mail of December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began to act as a lobbyist in the company, the head of Mr. Ensign's staff - John Lopez - he communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "bagged" to the Home Office about the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton for a lobbyist job.
When the report on the affair first appeared last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican head of the Senate.
After many months of stagnation, Mr Ensign told the reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third parliamentary term in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the object of investigating the crime, spokesperson Jennifer Cooper stated that the senator hoped that the Ethical Commission would follow the Ministry of Justice quickly and end the entire investigation.
"The Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the Nevada people," she said.
The challenge of the village of Cheshire is turned to Twitter
Half a dozen were written in the courts.
One minute after a minute, they sent word about a terrible witness on Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter messages were concerned with rape and child bonding to beds in a house that was lit up.
On Thursday, a trial was held against Steven J. Hayes, who was sentenced to kill three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, the family, and was to be concluded officially by imposing the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have already filed appeals and arguments that the court would probably employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the extended use of Twitter of major reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this extended, immediate penetration of information with outrageous details then introduced a jury in a decision in the sense of public influence.
This claim could force the judge to consider whether or not to require new rules in the courtroom with the onset of new technologies.
"As I have seen in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Chief Defender of Mr Hayes.
The Judge of that trial, Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court of the State, briefly rejected the allegations concerning the proceeds of the last week and that the media were "attentively controlled" and that there was no evidence to indicate that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognised that intelligence from notorious cases can raise questions about the justice of the process.
In the 1966 U.S. Supreme Court of the United States judgment dismissed the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he stated in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the trial was a "carnival atmosphere" because of the media.
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration of the TV show and the movie "The Refugee".
Some lawyers have said that the appeal courts, which reviewed Hayes' judgment half a century later, could be surprised at the argument that new rules might be necessary to determine how to communicate from the courtrooms, which was unimaginable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, law professor Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report which said it was done freely.
Professor Donohue stated that some judges may be impressed with the idea that restricting direct communication from the courtrooms may make the process more fair.
The Twitter case is just one of Mr Hayes's many framed lawyers who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the judgment.
For example, the lawyers also argue that, in the case of Mr Hayes, it may be biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photos of the horror.
Some of the judges reported that they were horrified by the photographs of the victims that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The lawyers argue that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed a juror who was critical of the prosecutors and that he wrongly imposed more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The judges weren't separated.
But their arguments about the influence of the scope of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They objected to last month's verdict that the case dominated reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media kept blowing the flames of emotion in this case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters in court," wrote a lawyer, "there was something here in New Haven that was not yet visible, and it may also be a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists claimed that immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports later mentioned, and from their point of view, the judicial police should govern the scope of other processes.
But some lawyers have requested appeal courts with often used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are pursuing this right.
In their archives, they referred to the decision of the High Court of 1966 in the case of Dr. Sheppard's judgment, because of the spread of the process, and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the abyss?
This week, a small amount of courtesy appeared in Washington, D.C., following a campaign that was remarkable to its insults and negativeism.
Is this the first flag of true cooperation between two political parties or just an illusive moment before a quick return to a party fight in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting of President Obama and the parliamentary leaders has produced no fundamental findings on the fundamental issues that need to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as the definition of their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of the party's struggle.
The Wednesday public meeting of the President's deficit committee was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close cooperation for several months has built mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological divide that still divides members.
And it is quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the trial period - they are sounding signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the electoral patience towards the renewed party war.
Therefore, the Tuesday meeting and its subsequent evaluation of the participants were also carried out with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too extensive and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the conditions that have been in place for the past two years.
Whether it's a question of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections prepared Washington at least quickly.
"It is not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"You are inevitable after the election.
The elections stirred up the emotions of the strikers, and then they shut them up.
It's okay."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax reductions expired at the end of the year and no one considers it favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits, Republicans cannot look at how they support tax reductions for property while the unemployed reject unemployment aid.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is already greater optimism about the possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new opening agreement.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112th Congress is calling on January.
Rather, it is likely a period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing the things that need to be done, psychology in a short perspective will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - that courtesy will lead to real cooperation.
"I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely linked to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of tea parties who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of overcrowding, know that they must behave according to their promises and must reduce government spending and repeal the new law on health care.
These support lines are clear in their initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reform of the tax code and increase in some taxes, increase in retirement age and reduce expenditure.
The joint presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, put pressure on the deficit issue in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore to fight to get as close as possible to this number.
The greatest opposition is among elected officials in the jury who propose that in the case of financial issues we have, at least today, a small foundation or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in battles between the White House and the Parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans will call on Obama to settle the budget, tax and health care, when the period of greater party cooperation will follow.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There's a lot of evidence that, despite the party's last election, most Americans still want to see two sides that work together.
If it could go to the heel, as it was in 1995, then both parties will closely monitor the reactions of the public.
Whoever will threaten to cut the votes will probably change the course and seek a compromise.
That could be an optimistic view of things.
The partyivity and direction are now greater than that in the mid - 1990 ’ s, and it turns out that there was a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans than that of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a pre-emption for more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, many Americans would be welcomed by courtesy this week.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
A betrayed American document depicts Moscow as a refuge for corruption
The city's management is in the hands of "kleptocracy" and it continues to be part of the bribes and bribes for protection that come on the way to Kremlin, reported the US embassy in Russia in the records of February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are largely holding protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal transactions but also from organised criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "the vertical office" - will take his own when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The record sent to Washington by the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record shall be based on sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor and accused him of a large share of corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedveve, but since then we have only observed minimal changes in purge.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturin, who owns a prominent construction company for many years, have consistently denied corruption charges, and has won several charges for perjury for such accusations.
In September he said to the Russian television station when he was asked about the proven testimony of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's crap."
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be a vote.
However, it is unusual to meet such details in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of that by diplomats from foreign countries.
"The Moscow government and its connection with criminal elements have led some to call it 'disfunctional' and confirm that the government works more like a kleptocracy than as a government," says the report.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'Krisha' (the world of crime and the mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection), provided by the police, Federal Security Service, Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the U.S. Attorney, as well as everywhere in Moscow's government bureaucracy.
"Analyticals have identified a three-stage structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is on top."
"Federal Security Service, Department of Interior and Militia are in second degree."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are common criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spots in certain areas, as the city does not provide some services."
The report says that the FSB is taking money from the largest companies, and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "the owners of trade in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (than organized crime groups) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer so on course."
The record says that while the collection of money is complex, the protection itself can already be in trouble; even those who pay can be arrested at times.
For those who do not pay fast enough, their trades under different pretexts are closed.
Medvedev spoke several times about fighting corruption, but he admitted that he had made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably filled with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georga Satarov, director of the Moscow research team, Indem, in a recent interview.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
India estimates that Russia's national corruption costs more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th in the recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the country is sorted from the least to the most corrupt).
The revelation of a report by the US Embassy, which appeared in Moscow in late evening hours, certainly did not give rise to enthusiasm in the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov may be charged for Moscow’s shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue on the issue of solving the problem.
In an interview for CNN with Larry King Putin, he told Putin that the documents that WikiLeaks released could have been forgeries and he reacted angryly to the statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole matter is that this is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so unethical."
The Red Khmers' veterans are forced to cope with the past
In the savings-lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School of the man who built it reminded the leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality during the government of the Red Khmers, the commander in this remote custody of the Red Khmers in northwest Cambodia remains popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers gave up government, there's also been a breakdown of long-lasting loyalty in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims at the Forum of Truth and Reconciliation were allowed to confront the people who were part of the regime publicly.
In June, the government provided textbooks that explain to children the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, together, the United Nations and the Cambodian Court of First Conviction of a former Red Khmer member, the execution of the former leader, the notorious violence association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With all this progress, there was a growing unrest among the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts to reconcile and their attempts to rejoin Cambodian society.
"The former Red Khmers are a grudge and fear, but they are helpless to do anything," said Chang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life among the Red Khmers was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Government of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, 1.7 million people were estimated to have been executed or starved, to be sick or overworked.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowd the Pol Pot government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its soldiers fled to Cambodia border with Thailand.
There they started a rebellion that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sara were conducting guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok was cultivating supporters in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after the peace agreement, the United Nations-sponsored country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. The large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to switch to a government that culminated in the capitulations of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while waiting for trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Red Khmer fighters have fallen into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefits from surrendering," said Sok Leang of the Justice and Reconciliation Centre, which runs public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were manners without any idea of making a deal."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he settled as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"The Mok has fed everyone."
"But now life is hard because we must secure everything ourselves."
The current Red Khmer court also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Red Khmer.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the leaders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases in question.
It was little to calm down the Anlong Veng fears.
The recent speculation of the media focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in the Bantey Meanchey province during the government of the Red Khmer in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
A recent steamy evening with Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden house on a dirty road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared through the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Red Khmers.
If the court called her in, she'd refuse to go.
"Peace prevails in Cambodia and is stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has defected from the Red Khmer in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability will occur if the court seeks further suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"The Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chang Youk from the documentation center.
"Conciliation in Khmerian terms means bonding broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The Centre has issued the first textbook approved by the government on the Red Khmer, with 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Red Khmer.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only a few details about the Red Khmer, despite linking the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the trial is going to prosecute."
Such opposition makes the process of reconciliation more complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, textbooks, and courts are starting to influence, he said further.
The Red Khmers still have a powerful spell here.
Upstairs in the Dangrek Mountains is a road covered with weeds and stuffed with plastic bags, which leads to a rectangular of black soot covered with rusty roofs.
Pol Pota's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at that place.
"He has a strong spirit, but many local people come and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of mature bananas in the hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it appears to have a supply of uranium-based weapons
In a surprising victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they would surrender their stocks of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The Agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the Security Summit by Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martinique.
For years, the U.S. government has been trying to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had hit a rock last spring.
But U.S. officials have said The Washington Post that in the last two months, a few covert operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove the £187 of uranium-based weapons from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for a Wednesday agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately £500, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April at which Belarus was eliminated.
And apparently it was a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a seat at the summit on nuclear safety 2012."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group supporting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the deal a "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries rid themselves of all their reserves of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is going to be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
During Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of pounds of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our commodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and showed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, announced by officials.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1 300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, said the officials.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, said the officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it on the supply of less enriched uranium to the Belarusian research institute, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust", which led to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Three Reduction.
This year, James Martin Center for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, seek to remove its stocks by 2012.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been tense for years, especially because of Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possibility of gradual melting.
"We welcome the progress made on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and this is essential for the country's and its people's progress," he said.
The Spanish government didn't make CIA flights expensive.
The Spanish government did not do any valuables regarding CIA flights carrying inmates of the Taliban and members of Al-Qaida to Guantánamo through Spanish territory, as expressed in its telegram by the US ambassador to Madrid.
This is consistent with the documents provided by the Wikileaks daily El País, where it is also written that the first Deputy Prime Minister, María Teresa Fernándezová de la Vega, asked that the Spanish enforcement be informed and "could thus show that she has adequate supervision of foreign aircraft passing through Spanish airspace".
A meeting was held between Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega in June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe, which accused a dozen States, including Spain, of participating in human rights violations.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the message of the Council of Europe "was taking Zapater's government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain had no problem with flights of secret services across its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "disposed unprepared", reports Aguirre in one of the documents.
Also, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, then Foreign Minister, suggested to the US ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give the matter the lowest possible outline, but by the fact that this matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence".
In February 2007, D.A. Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as it is concerned, he did not intend to block the initiative of the judge to request the declassification of documents of the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating component or any sensitive information", explained the Embassy after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the US has expressed concerns for "obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than to declassify CNI information or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 on the occasion of lunch by the US Ambassador and Home Secretary Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, the ambassador said that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he already instructed his co-workers to "do away with the infuriated comments with the intention of reducing tension".
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the political party Party Party of the Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - note) in this matter.
"In spite of her general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Party of Popular will not hesitate to take advantage of any indications that Zapater's government tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if this revelation could have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
The killer mother's admitted mother complained on the network of mother's "attention"
A young woman talked about a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog, "Terror in Galician."
Monica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
She communicated with her cousin and at least one friend, both of whom are from Noia in the La Coruña region of which the young woman comes.
The news is from 2008.
In order to understand them, the woman’s emotional life, which the ABC newspaper is reconstructing with the help of the testimony of her family members, must be known.
A 30 - year - old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Túnesz in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
A man wanted to know if the newborn child was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had a DNA test done.
She soon found a new relationship.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby city of Lousame.
Their coexistence took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When a girl left for the Balearic Islands to look for a job, she stayed with her partner, who even came to visit Palma for a week.
However, the content of its communication shows that the relationship has fallen apart.
She's alone in Menorca in March 2008 and she says, "Alberto's some angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he has to be with a little one all day, and he can't do what he wants."
Then he's talking about the text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I should send you the baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
in May, he talks about his return to his place of residence: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm only going to stay till 19. because 20. I have to go to work so I don't miss the place."
She explains that if everything goes well, she'll take her son to her place.
"He's gonna be with who he's supposed to be with, I mean, me, and he's never gonna happen again, I'm gonna leave him with someone other than my mother," a questionable intention with regard to her bad relationships.
There's another post in July.
When this message is out, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and probably was murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"The Caesar is satisfied on one side, but on the other hand he is not."
"On the one hand, he's with me, and he kind of likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
They're talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school there, so I'm going to save some money for the nanny."
17th Greetings and Complaints.
"A big mouth from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you no e-mail videos, look how much he wants, meets me, needs sex."
On the 30th, the next message: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one report on Víctor, the current partner: "He's giving me money".
On the Internet, Monica's contributions are on the scars dedicated to anime and manza.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she had her name called Muki ex-prisoner.
"Galician Terror."
The last man with whom she lived, the guardian, expresses his pity and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Last night, Monica entered a provincial pulpit in Palma, where she came from a detention center in Menorca.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant doesn't remember how everything happened and "she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before that, however, she admitted that she drowned Caesar in the tub and put his body in the trunk.
The defense and the D.A. are requesting a psychiatric examination.
People would win 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 mandates
with the results of 28 November, the PP party could have the main word at the town halls in Lérida, Tarragon and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in the vote and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Catalan People's Party – zpozkl.) already has a given idea of general elections, whether or not there is an increase, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in the national elections is usually one of these compared to the Catalan elections.
in 2008, the Catalan people received 610.473 votes in general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, this number was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (Catalan People's Party) received 384.091 votes.
If this increase trend is maintained, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyal voters of PP, analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were held, the PCC could obtain 12 MPs in the House compared to the existing 8, the CiU (Convergencia i Unió, Czech Congregation and Union) would also receive 4 mandates (now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the parties of PP and PSOE (Spain Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the people, the ERC (Levice Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one Member - now it has 3 - while the ICV (The Green Initiative for Catalonia - note) would continue to have one mandate or would receive another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest performance will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the leadership of the socialists in the four major provincial cities, as well as on the changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administration with the largest anticipated budget - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and folk agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the town hall in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive the majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV parties.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona office - because at least 5% of the votes have to be obtained.
The PP Party has increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists believe that they could play a major role in the Tarragon rotation, where they ruled together with the party of PP in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP won only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
Humanities have also been awarded to other major town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
At present, PP has a representation at 34 town halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and one Nigerians who were detained by the General Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which provided passports to various groups of Al-Qaeda organizations, including "Tiggers of the liberation of Tamil Ílam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", while the second group was the author of assassinations in Mumbai, where 106 people were killed in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to secure the weakening of Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus at international level by using the "Operation Kampai" to "restrict its operational capabilities".
The investigators estimate that this cell could, within two years of being active in Catalonia, send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then falsified and then supplied to groups that form the criminal galaxy of Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could travel impunably across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active cell that the jihad network in Europe had, and that is why other European police units participated in such investigations, in addition to Thai services, and it is therefore impossible to rule out that there will be similar interventions in other European countries in the coming days, such as those in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) further developed in Thailand, during which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kyjbumrung were captured.
It was these men who were driving a cell from Bangkok based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, some of which were liquidated in 2009, was stealing, in particular, travel passports for tourists that met the requirements of Islamists.
This means that the documents must have belonged to men between the ages of 25 and 45, had to be valid for several years and be without marked visas.
The investigation papers point out that no facts are yet known that link the detained from Catalonia with the assassination in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was to be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth mentioning that a few days before this assassination was sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency of about a thousand dollars, which were "inserted" on the purchase of cards into mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "comand" that killed 106 people.
The police have already confiscated a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) demands Maso to stop the fiscal agreement
President of the PPC (Catalan People's Party) Alicia Sánchez-Camach had the opportunity to present to Arthur Mas yesterday her personal terms and conditions under which she is willing to support his appointment as President Generalitat; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is to revive the economy and renounce risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leaders want to propose during their mandate.
The President of the Catalan People's Party came to a meeting with Artur Mas with a certainty of 18 parliamentary seats received in the last Sunday elections, which is a number more than satisfactory for gaining a favor, so that at least one of the opposition formations needs to abstain from voting on his appointment to the office.
The possible match with PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists in the House would like to hold when the general elections take place, but so far the talks that Mas and the rest of the political leaders are holding in the Catalan spirit.
As far as the President of PP is concerned, in order to gain her support for putting him into office, "he will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberating speeches", as well as the economic agreement - similar to the one from Basque - which the head of the CiU even wanted to vote on in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to cut short on the out-of-date political apparatus of autonomous governance and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Masov's entry into office will be dealt with in the framework of the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas had already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised the hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric establishment shall ensure that the deaths have not occurred as a result of the "deprivement of measures"
The performances of Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The head of the La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) geriatric centre yesterday provided a press conference to describe the damage caused by Joan Vila Dilmé's criminal behavior institution, a caregiver who, while being employed here, killed at least eleven seniors in custody.
The director of this home for seniors Joan Sala appeared accompanied by a lawyer named Joan Canada, and announced that "the wish of La Caritat's home would be able to press charges against the culprit responsible for the killing, but "the law and responsibility oblige us to leave this trial to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the caregiver in good time, La Caritat's home is now a major threat to material compensation, which is already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the deceased.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had already occurred in August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight clients' bodies of a senior home, suspected that in many cases no doctor had checked the deceased personally, but that, given the age and poor health of patients, everything was handled on the phone.
La Caritat, through her director, resolutely rejected this extreme and stressed that "the lack of measures could not in any way have been the cause of what had happened".
La Caritat's attorney added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party would have committed a mistake other than his own defendant."
A man now named "An Angel of Death" admitted 11 killings yesterday and stated that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killed the other old woman a month and a half later.
In this case, death caused too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first time he used a mixture of tranquilizer tablets.
Director La Caritat also stated that it is complicated to control the access of staff to medicines.
Insulin and sedative cocktails were probably in six of the nine cases a means used by the caregiver to kill patients in an attempt to relieve them from suffering.
However, it is only the analysis now taking place in the laboratory that should show whether Vila is lying and actually looking for less cruel death for his first victims, or, on the contrary, killed them with a lye, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe in health claims and do not rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than he confessed to, and justify their behavior in various versions, which Villa gave to the court knowing that he had to change his actions when it came out that he killed eight people.
That is why they say that they want to be available to the full extent of this matter.
The European Central Bank is threatening
Yesterday, investors responded to yesterday's threat from President Trichet, who pointed out that 'markets should not underestimate our ability to react'.
The regional differentials were closed by the power and the shares by the European Bank fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be wrong - the euro has just risen above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although falling, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
The investor will take some time to lose his fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as taking back the level of liquidity today, and will have to appeal tomorrow for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the state debt buy-back plan for inefficiencies and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within a period of time and to leave unlimited access only for one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be forecasted "minimum until March" and will comply with the three-monthly bid with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and even announce its intensification.
If they do not meet the expectations created, they will create a re-reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to withdraw the liquidity ratio, God is with us!
It was the same at a convention in May where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a market collapse - tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May it was announced by the armory fist on Monday and on Wednesday it announced that it had already bought many of them, causing another market collapse.
Yesterday's auction for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro only spent 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting a change in the mood of the market after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures were published representing the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimated amounts represent approximately 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15.000, they have a chance to become private capital by February, otherwise they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the problem has not been detected by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the auxiliary plan and will help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to obtain the approval of the new budget by Parliament, and it still does not have sufficient support, so there is still uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has mitigated the tone of her speech in order to release tension in the face of the next EU summit meeting on 14 December, on which there is a need for a political compromise that would show that we are a Union and we are all on the same ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner while the others prefer Beethoven's Ode to joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present yesterday a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, employment recovery measures - to investors' ears sounds like the four-year period since Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapater explains why the Spanish stock exchange increased by 4.5%, twice as much as the other European exchanges.
Unlike February, the response of the Government and the Spanish National Bank was quick and persuasive - we seem to be recovering from the effect of surprise.
Today, we have a key three-year bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which, we hope, will be a huge demand that will help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Requesting a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They'd give us the cash we don't need - there's 40,000 million in cash in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - even high rates and access to markets would be closed to us sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use Cesar's woman's strategy - 'not only to be it, but also to seem it'.
We can do this.
The president of the Eulen Group will challenge the meeting of Vega Sicilia, requested by his children.
The storm in an open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, does not remain silent.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack him after he took him for "very insignificant", the legal proceedings of El Enebro planned for the 16th of this month and required five of his seven offspring, on whom they should try to enforce their majority and take possession with the help of the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José align the legal group for a new chapter of their dispute over the control of part of the society.
The founder of the largest company service holding company does not seem to be willing to rely on El Enebro in its dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the group.
five of their seven descendants were assembled from its Administrative Committee, who were appointed leaders during the Shareholders' Meeting on 18 January this year and whose objections are raised in the Commercial Register.
The proceedings of the El Enebro Group scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, convened by Commercial Court Officer No. 2 in Madrid, restored the thunder in the Álvarez family's womb.
Until the dispute is resolved, the appeal to the judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convocation of the commission.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is considered by David Álvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving with the help of judicial deception and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the negotiations of 18 January, which was completely invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal assault of this action as "a completely insignificant one".
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, tried without success to have the court convene in June.
In El Enebro, a group owned in addition to other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires a right of use to 51% of the capital.
This issue is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when referring to the question of judicial assault, and the date of such trial has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software proposes improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull invaded Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the opportunities of this newcomer team too seriously, and despite the rising trend in recent times, everyone was betting on Ferrari Fernanda Alonsa's triumph.
Without wanting to reduce the riding skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the ability of the Renault engine to drive his car, in Formula 1 world, the legend - the "secret weapon" that multi-national Siemens placed in Red Bull's hands to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating marches that the German company marketed in 2007 for the purposes of very remote car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, power plants and high precision devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
The PLM has facilitated the development of Canon, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this software enabled the Red Bull team to perform "in the course of several hours, in almost real time" modifications and improvements that otherwise detect during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992 they employed on average 10 technicians who were able to perform no more than three or four improvements during one period.
team Red Bull is currently working on 180 highly qualified young professionals equipped with powerful information technology who analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of the Red Bull racing vehicles, except for the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are being modified.
The changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical option is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up around 50 km from London a race of top technology to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings, which are limited to visiting - especially to journalists.
Everything that's happening here is considered a "big secret."
The list of participants in the project includes 580 people, including two pilots – the Vettel Champion and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's hero in Formula One is no doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, other protagonists whose assistance is invaluable are hidden behind the immeasurable technological means that the brand of energy drinks has placed in their participation in racing circles.
The head of production technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in vehicle research and development contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was due to the riders.
At present this ratio has changed and technology is worth the success of 85%, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology because they are "unforeseeable gladiators".
HP will set up 20 own shops in cooperation with local distributors within two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with its business partner Pont Reyes opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of the network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 which the multinational company is planning to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
The Spanish vice president, HP Helena Herrer, set an example of a newly rebuilt store at Gran Vía, Barcelona, belonging to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company prepared a plan for the establishment of 200 sales points in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the shop in Barcelona is third.
Herrer did not want to reveal where other stores would be opened, but she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrerová, who also runs HP personnel systems, assured us that the philosophy of opening stores will be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company deals with the exclusive design of the equipment stores (with products that can be interactively tested), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with the provision of business personnel.
Helena Herrer denied that this would be a franchising, and stressed that the exclusive network of stores was aimed at "improvement of customer service, services for small and medium-sized enterprises when purchasing, servicing, after-sales service and even packaging".
The trade in Barcelona is part of a pilot pioneer program at world level, which aims to solve any problems with computer devices in guarantee.
Online service is connected with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we can solve problems within 10 minutes that can otherwise last up to two days."
"This system is especially designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and for regular customers, given that large companies already have a technical assistance contract service", stressed Helena Herrer yesterday.
Sabadell bets that he "steals" over three years to his competitors a million clients
Optimistic than other bosses, a delegated member of Banco Sabadell Bank, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be challenging, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of a passive war.
Nevertheless, it is expected that interest rates will be reduced, but they will try to compensate by reducing bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to win over a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The goal is, in addition to survival without having to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by catching a million new private clients - or 700,000 - if those who, if necessary, leave the bank - because until now and even the institute, rather pampered small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses than small clients.
This year the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while it is more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or can be said to be sober, in order to reduce the costs, whose challenges will be shown by the bank when it presents results over the period.
At this time, few banking institutions dare to set their targets and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all plans of world banking.
Sabadell will close his Optima programme four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension for the next period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the meeting held by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be "severe and very important".
Indeed, he feels that the way out of the crisis in Spain will be "long".
In addition, it will be "very difficult to create employment" in two or three years' time, which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although they believe that the passive war - which reduces margins - is backing down, the price of premiums for the risk that banks and savings banks are paying for their emissions to receive liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thus offsetting a reduction in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural and will represent a pressure factor on loans."
"We haven't closed the faucet yet, but the differentials are very high," acknowledges Guardiol.
Banesto has already issued his network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also recognised that the trend in banking "now is a reduction in commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not for nothing, he assures that in Spain "they will require a larger size".
"The next year will not remain on the stone," he assured.
It confirms that the needs of capital are "decreasedly" and does not rule out that some Spanish institutions will enter between the red numbers.
It points out that FROB can complement the collection of funds on the market before the new capital measure.
Following the assurance that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it continues to pose a serious problem of what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but, unlike what was in June, short-term financing can be obtained by means of a repo rate, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA rules out another wave of savings funds mergers
The CEO of CECA rejected yesterday that another wave of savings funds mergers should be created and once again insisted on the speed at which the sector is being reorganised.
When the Spanish Savings Association was launched, there were several institutions that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for round two.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings (CECA) Mr Antonio Olavarrieta ruled out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should be created.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, the inclusion of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica Group cannot be considered as a second round, what is happening is a convention."
"Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 institutions, we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well on this matter," said the director.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (Aragon Leaders and Executive Officials Association), Olavarriet stated that the process of concentration is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the instalments that appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank in their time, not now", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no history of comparison, thus reducing the number of institutions by 62% so that these are larger and therefore in line with the Basel Treaty", he underlined.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a number of not too happy opinions on the slowness of the process", which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we must be on the deadline before the end of the year".
CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world, and that those who question it have assigned "a lack of knowledge".
The Director noted that under the current favourable economic situation "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks, as well as the system which managed the "very important" process of concentration and which continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking was very well based on the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and Red German Lines
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but has set the conditions for the Union as a whole.
The tension in the markets has provoked a twofold government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed a new adaptation measure, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, the regulation of private brokerage agencies or the cancellation of EUR 426 for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spain airports and air traffic management - note: over), the airport manager Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the national lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felip González, joined the critics at Chancellor Angela Merkel's address for her responsibility to launch the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
In advance, Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of re-defining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what his future is supposed to be like, which runs counter to the idea of respecting the old traditions that a large part of the other members hold on to.
Faced with European opposition, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible paths from the crisis.
The first one is a strong euro area, which would include Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, for example, while the southern states would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the return to Mark - although it may now appear like a scifi, this version has broad public support, close to 50% of the population.
The third possibility is, according to the German proposals, to re-work the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary severity, fines for guilty countries, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and to extend the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for the dials now.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission stimulated deficits in 2009, the German government drew a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of contradiction between what Germany considered to be right (plans of fiscal severity and sustainability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second one was shown by this Central European country when Merkel was painfully stretching the decision to save Greece.
It was already subject to acute criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again appeared with a clear view when she demanded reforming the European Union Conventions so that the rescue of a Member State could be possible, while at the same time allowing private creditors to bear part of their costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European because it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat mitigated form, has been approved, and over the next few months we should be monitoring the Union's reform process, which should allow for these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it is not going to cross.
And it tells us to all that, although it is now necessary to take measures that seem to disagree with them too, from this date on, the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will constitute the birth of a new monetary zone in which countries that infringe the rules will be subject to severe sanctions and may be forced to announce the deferral of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany suggests that we must take a strong path to growth with an increase in savings and investments, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on debts and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments that was ruled by Spain during the boom of growth, simply does not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much harder.
And the worst part is, under these conditions, we might be mistaken ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will replace more calmly.
And that we take advantage of the opportunity they're giving us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his double statement (the reforms promised after meeting with the big companies from last Saturday and yesterday's notification of the new measures) gives the impression that despite the criticisms to Merkel's address, the path to the idea of putting things right has opened.
However, the red line that Germany has set out is here, and it does not seem to want to move it.
And the possibility of leaving the euro area cannot be excluded from what can be considered.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
Finty's performance in the Alonso and Ramos fight against Ajax shows the wit, not the intention to escape the punishment.
The supposed exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonsa and Sergio Ramos) in the match of the Champions League against Ajax of 23 November caused a sea ink about whether this is or is not a sporty behavior and whether UEFA should not punish both footballers.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (who had their team clearly won) the named players were deliberately wasting their time in the moment when the foul was to be played to provoke the barrel, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfil the prescribed penalty in the following match against Auxerre - while Real Madrid will end up in its group at the forefront - and will be able to continue, freed from the cards, to the next stage.
Finally, UEFA Disciplinary Commission sent coach José Mourinh a penalty for two games, and guilty players were fined cash.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, i.e. rules that are not written, but follow each other.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that the Real Madrid team (which boasts in its anthem of generosity and honor, and which has already fined for similar acts of its players) and, apparently, thanks also to the drama led by Mourinh, who thus adds to his long history a comedian and provocater another episode.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of action, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts are circumventing the law; indeed, these are actions that respect the rules of sport, the purpose of which, however, seems to be to circumvent.
It is solved what kind of damage such actions are caused by a sporting spirit.
One aspect of sporting behavior is the physical inviolability of opponents who have not been violated in these cases, or there has been no violent play.
Another of these elements characterizing a pure game is to avoid players having an advantage against the team's opponent - which has not happened here either.
Thus, paradoxical at the action of the players of Real Madrid is the fact that what we do not normally characterise as a ruse or a circumvention of the law did not occur a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour should be as obvious as possible in order to receive the punishment.
They waited and liked to get the punishment.
The next question is, however, what benefit will the culprits of their intentional offense have?
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent is not in a disadvantaged position and that he will not achieve any advantage in the current game, as the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for the next game, because the club won't be able to count on these players.
The advantage is clearly that players will start the next stage of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardise their participation in the next game.
However, it is an advantage from the long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first sight the team can be eliminated, and in addition, players will be punished by this negotiation and switch to the second round of cards in which it is enough to exclude one card less than in the first round.
So as the wheels continue, it will not be quite clear whether this is an advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not go against the sport spirit, which includes making strategic decisions that will enable maximum benefits under the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, the players did not aim to avoid being punished (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or running away from punishment.
Although the line between wit and circumvention is not quite clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a wit.
It seems to me that the polemics are created for two reasons: because they were two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions for their release were transmitted from the leadership.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
Dictate calendar concentrates this year on the avalanche of the reservation on 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by the employees themselves, who want to spend between €20 and €30, are rapidly increasing.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, the coming of December brings back pre-night parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis they have resulted in a fight to win customers down prices: almost all want to spend between €20 and €30 for food, the questioned entrepreneurs and associations from this sector agree.
To complete the complications of the numbers, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) applications for a week from 13 December, resulting in an avalanche of reservations for the days in the peak (16th and 17th), while in the previous week there was hardly any operation.
As has been the case since the beginning of the thin years since 2008, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to leave tradition, many employees pay to spend at parties from their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of load capacity, says the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
At this point, the representative of the patronship of the restaurant is not dared to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will change their minds before they make reservations."
"They want to go out, but when it comes to price issues, they're careful," he adds.
Stores will go well for those who offer quality and good service at a favourable price, says and recalls that due to the crisis customers tend to go down and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
Examination in various facilities shows that the biggest demand for a reservation is on the evening of 17th December.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom reservation for this Friday, with most of the requirements for spending up to 30 euros, which has been adjusted by the menus offered, the total prices of which are between 25 and 30 euros.
In another major company, Andilana, which has 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought the peculiarity of this year's calendar of more early reservations since the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros", they state.
In AN Group Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and has a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they have recorded a profit increase since the second half and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
The sources of this society stress that 18 December will also be a busy day, as there will be Christmas celebrations among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded a tendency for guests to spend 10% more last year in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - note).
They also noticed that companies are already appearing, which are again inviting their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
The Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Centres of Leisure in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he begins to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "livened" although the clients "contract at maximum".
Even during Christmas celebrations, the impression did not give way to paying, no matter who pays, points.
Pakistan’s nuclear program gave birth to major unrest in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons "at a faster pace than any other country".
The Wikileaks documents confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department of Foreign Affairs, published by Wikileaks, confirms the extraordinary unrest that is causing Pakistan’s nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the explanatory and important details that they offer regarding the content of communications and ideas of representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear safety instead of increasing, "is at a retreat", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored in pieces to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - represents one of the main reasons for watching Washington.
This is calculated by the ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in one report before the visit of James Jones' National Security Adviser: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, the alleged dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability to the transport of nuclear materials".
An increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and a missile-controlled program is no longer seen only by the US, but also by Russia, as a growing and representing reason to be on the lookout.
"Pakistan had to hire staff with strong religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline in the level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or missile-controlled programmes," said the expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with his counterparts from the USA.
The largest new documentation published by Julian Assange is increasingly less and less cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and an increased rate of Pakistani production of these weapons.
The deposit issued by the embassy in May, which classified communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", states: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or are rejected".
in another report, Peter Lavoy, a member of the National Intelligence Service for South Asia, states that 'in spite of an economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country in the world'.
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington, during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani's chief of army, to "explain very well" that the "Pakistan army must end the silent support of terrorist groups".
Hon to the boss of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high-ranking employee responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol is issuing a "red challenge" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it's hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday the "extraordinary call", the so-called red notice, to "location and monitoring of the movement" Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but the sexual abuse charges that Australia is facing in Sweden.
In addition, he assures Wikileaks’ attorney Mark Stephens that "police know where and how to contact Mr Assang".
It was November 20, when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when he received a permit from the Swedish authorities.
In this context, 188 Interpol countries have guidelines to identify or locate Assange "in order to make a temporary connection to him and issue him".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of the person concerned by the red call, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, however, consider the so-called red notices as enabling the arrest to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national police - especially if the countries have a bilateral surrender agreement, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be.
Asseng’s lawyers, who published writing yesterday, said that the ninety - nine - year - old Wikileaks founder was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities using videoconferencing.
They also remind that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of her case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovič Berija, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal persecution," says the letter.
While the whole world is looking for him - and his mother is defending her son's innocence from Australia - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he does not remain silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine through Skype, calling for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in this interview.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering US diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations, thus violating the international conventions that the United States has signed, she should withdraw," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who classified the demand for demise as "funny and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should care about the individual who runs the website," he said for CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a high-ranking employee responsible for the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent further document leaks.
The intention of President Obama's spokesperson to stop adding Assang to the importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators declare these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will chair the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber from January, asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organisations, "to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance".
Even further went Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange should "be killed", which he had to cancel.
"Obama should be giving him a reward or using a plane or something."
Whoever did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist priest, former Governor of Arkansas, and possible candidate for president.
"Whoever is in the government, who is responsible for leaking information, has committed treason, and any punishment other than execution would be too mild," said Fox Station
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC by "twittering" on Caroda's support
The Republican leader will allow the party to secret vote on its survival.
Huguet proposes more plural enforcement and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for fighting the already several internal revolutions in the ERC (Levice Republican Party of Catalonia) which is inconsequential due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture about the demise seems inadequate to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weakened as its leader himself, and that he cannot do him absolutely as much as he did with other lost currents.
That's why the leader of the Left will try to get new criticisms through wink, which will help him to defend himself in the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee would be able to speak secretly for his post.
By using the ballots, not by lifting your hand.
If Carod's supporters wish to give the chairman a criminal vote, they will be able to do so without fear of retribution.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the dissolution and submission of his person.
in several interviews he claimed that he would not have considered himself confirmed with half the votes and one additional, but added, without specifying the percentage that he would not have been a good result "in Bulgaria".
Carod's supporters demand more than his office to make it available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercós controls the largest body at the conventions.
But given that they do not have a sufficient majority to enforce resignation, they will try to enforce the plan from now until May.
They therefore expect to participate in the drafting of a strategy reorientation document, which will be given the vote by the national council on 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for promising to move Congress already in autumn 2011.
The leader of the ERC stated that "multiplicity" is damaging stability, and that its goal is that once and for all, the organization should be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems to be a typical article signed by current advisor Josep Huguet on his blog.
After taking into consideration Puigcercós' ideologist, this innovation advisor took for granted that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he named them five, two of which stand out.
The first is the "decomposition" of the enforcement so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which also includes new faces that are in the Carod-like sector.
The second target can be big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should completely end the meeting as a mechanism of operation.
So he is fighting for reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates elected by the vote.
The completion of the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction at the last two conventions.
However, the convulsive 2008 assembly decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special congress on the reform of the Statutes.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the Party has discouraged the resolution of this matter.
Now, without lurking critical sectors, it might be a good time to re-examine this matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered for the month of November; 390 for the year 2010
According to the journal MILENIO, Mexico has seen a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, as reported in the Millenio.
Between the murders, there are three women's cases, and a couple of bodies were found separated in the Valley of Mexico.
In the past month of the year, there are 390 killings in Mexico, possibly related to organised crime.
Among the cases is the founding of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in Toluca County.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, followed by a blow from grace to the head, and had hands and legs tied with rope.
The next day a body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle above Mixtecas street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early in the morning on Thursday, November 4, the cooperatives discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots to the chest at the Tenango-Ixtagan de la Sal highway in the section of the Villa Guerrero district.
There was a message next to the body, probably signed by La Familia Michoacana.
A day later a 50 - year - old man was murdered by eight shots in Nezahualcoyotl after he came out of his house and wanted to start collecting trash.
On November 7, they were killed by a bullet to the head of two victims at the age of 30 in the colony of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, in the district of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, a dead man was found on a remote road in the colony El Naranjo, and a bullet was found under the body from a gun of a calibre 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the sewage canal in Playa Golondrina's colony.
The rescue forces carried out a thorough search for other parts of it, but they did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlan reported the finding of a body with its hands tied in the back and its head in Pen Colorado's place.
A man had a gunshot wound to his back.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapan de Zaragoza was reported, and reports of death were also found in the victims.
A day later, she was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the Los Reyes La Paz district, a cardboard box containing a human head.
The rest of the body was found in a nearby colony, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the village of Zoquiapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning a man was found killed in Huixquilucan, wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, which was provisionally reported by the killers left at his body, identified as Mario Ríos.
In Ixtapeluca, a woman with no signs of life was found in San Francisco Acuautla with two wounds in her back.
On the skin of the woman was discovered a tattoo of the sacred character Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death" - note.) and also necklaces with its resemblance.
At the end of the month, a body of a man was found in the village of Zinacanantepec with at least three gunshot wounds and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found in Santiago Tepatlaxco, who had their head wrapped with tape, and there was also a report in the village of Puente de Piedra.
With the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations that said, "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found carrying signs of torture and tied up limbs inside an abandoned taxi behind the centre of justice in the colony of San Agustín.
The last day of the month were found remains of two men in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first one was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and left a message; while the other one was tortured and found in a plastic case in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him, the agents found a note with a message.
China is respecting its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
At the UN Conference on Climate Change, COP16 assured that its country had made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and specified that it insisted on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, as assured by Su Wei, the country's representative at the UN Conference on Climate Change.
In his first public speech at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said that his country has already invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the last four years.
It is clear, however, that China will not change its objectives and will continue to work on this issue with the international community.
He pointed out that the Chinese strategy on climate change was divided into the following four headings: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
On all these points, they have already seen progress, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed greenhouse gas reduction targets, explained.
He further stressed that the federal authorities in China had co-ordinated with the provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives in terms of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
In addition, as he has communicated, the various multiannual plans, which are financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states, are in progress or have already been completed.
For example, it is, as he said, a programme for the efficient use of energy that has been implemented over the last five years and which has received investments from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
There is also a provincial project of climate change, as well as a project of exchange of fluorescent lamps for savings bulbs and a project of mitigation and adaptation, specified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert climate change advisor, assured that China's efforts were greater than its general idea.
For example, he outlined that greenhouse gas emissions per capita are 6 tonnes in China, whereas in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts on the use of energy - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects it to make further progress by 2020.
Exclusion of Espin: César Nava
The national president of the party PAN (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - zpoznam.) stated that the former chairman of this party is entitled to apply to the National Order Commission for his right.
The National President of the PAN Party, César Nav Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos has been prohibited, and that the former President of the party is entitled to contact the National Order Commission and claim his right.
in an interview that had been taken before the statement of opposition by the Governor of the State, Mr Cué Monteagud, he said that, in any event, the exclusion of Espin was a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Orders Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal in his case through a complaint to the National Council’s Orders Committee in order to act on a decision taken by a competent authority," he added.
He further explained that there is no time to think about 2012 and that he had never been to the negotiating table about the alliance's presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the PAN would emerge from the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his followers would be elected, strengthened.
"This (alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was an intention for local elections, which was successful and fulfilled its purpose", he said.
The President of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue was behind him, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, on the contrary, we are taking advantage of it and strengthening us," he added.
He said that the committee could elect the best president or chairperson, whom the PAN deserves for the next three years, without debate, so he would hand over the relay to 'whom the committee will designate'.
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, to any of these five I will proudly hand over to the President's office."
He predicted that the rise that the party had recorded in the last July elections would be reflected in future clans, although "there is no time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, which have roots in Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloe, will be the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, since "the many expectations and desires are put in them, and I am sure that Gabin will live up to these expectations".
When we asked him about the criticisms of President Felipe Caldénó Party of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institution Party, Note) because of his speeches within the four years that he rules, César Nava called on members of the PRI to think about the six-year periods of former Presidents Ernest Zedillo and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If in the PRI they believe that the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the rule of Fox and Cladeñ, let them begin defending them, let them come out of their shell," he testified.
He said that the head of federal executive power had the right to express itself as he did during his speech in the National Auditorium, as gag and censorship are not used in this country.
Obama promotes law on Twitter to support students with no ID
"If you think the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to approve this law," tweeted the US president on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama today added a contribution to his personal Twitter social network account to national mobilisation in support of the Dream Act, which should legalise students without documents.
"If you think that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to approve this law," said Obama.
His brief report draws attention to the Internet reference to a more comprehensive document asking the public to contact the senators without delay, as the vote on this law is approaching.
"If the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion ring," he points out.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless an extension of the tax reductions in the Bush era and government financing was approved.
Such blocking, which has been notified by a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the president said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar could be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the matter of taxes before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach an agreement on this matter and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of Chamber Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he will ask for a "vote on the closure of the debate" concerning the Dream Act, so that the proposal for legalisation of students without documents could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although it is more likely next week.
Senatorial approval of the Dream Act, or the "American Dream Act", would legalise about 800 000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country during the last five years and were admitted to higher education institutions or the army.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve the draft, so they need the help of several Republicans, so that the organisations of its supporters carry out intense agitation to ensure the approval of this law.
The Democrats, the majority of which Dream Act supports, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act project need to acquire several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators most in the negotiations are the senators from Maine Olympia Snow and Susan Colins, as well as the outgoing senator from Florida George Lemieux, who complemented Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they have said that they will no longer support it.
The other Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although the House of Representatives is inclined to another version, according to most analysts, Dream Act will face the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature they insert their finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "insert finger into the wound" is similar to the Czech "hit nail on the head - note.)
The second round of the cycle The pleasure of the language was a promenade where the participants demonstrated the literary gala of the performance
"I understand that with Sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", writer Luisa Valenzuel asked, who was invited to launch a second round of The pleasure of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature written in Spanish language, and the question of which was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at the other fair devoted themselves to the topic of Sex in the language at the round table, explained).
The finger in the wound "brings us to the narrow," said the nice Argentinian writer to the audience, composed mainly of young people, who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the round table, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergia Ramírez, Maya Monter and Luis García Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that she gave Gonzalu Celoria, and which Schultz then referred to as a great story in which Luisa performed in the first person as a protagonist, who goes from a doctor to a doctor who has not been answered, although the traces of the same story do.
The infectologist goes away convinced: " Patience is not my strong suit, maybe it will be my wound".
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road but explained that the wound is not a scientific term, he is a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the morning represents a truly open and thus symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist took a light breath and concluded that "she managed to learn about the wound only so much that she was really open and that she didn't exist", but she became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls in the language must go hand in hand with each other.
Writer Valenzuel played both of them.
Nikaragęc Sergio Ramirez also appeared with a lovely story called the Praise of Invention in which the finger is not appointed in the wound, but will appear at one moment.
With the elements of magical realism, she talks about the famous witch who played the clouds, brought back people who went far, or repaired the virtues that one virgin lost, this story that turned around to talk to America, a great novel in which from the beginning his own chroniclers, who told it, were not missing, and is quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticises the exaggeration of conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us (the writer), mocked with a fake testimony, which was presented in stories as real, but in other ways never managed to tell the story of America with such imagery, which even lacked shame."
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have more imagination" and just where reality and a lie flow, where they no longer know what of the story belongs to one group and, as to the other, reaches the fictional literature of its peak.
That's what he really calls a "Cervant tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Mayra Monter then stressed and praised the diversity of interpretations that enabled the invitation of the International Book Fair with its Assessed Prst to the wound.
With her finger, the Cuban-Portorian writer showed a big blow to the social violence that is going through her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is a result of trade disputes and drug trafficking.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs make a silent compromise, which, of course, is not intended", she said after she said that the reality of literature is a communication and a dimension of a compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also put the emphasis "on this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and control of consciousness, which is overflowing with dogmatisms, it is forgotten that "every time there is a small not behind it, and behind every denial there is also a small yes".
"To be masters of our thoughts and reality we must dye: and to dye means to put a finger in the wound many times and to harass those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, black and white, in fixed times and without coloring, and also to harass the authorities that prefer this black and white world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes after his first title
Ruben Omar Romano reads three defeats in the finals, he experienced good and bad during his career, but he has already achieved three opportunities for a decisive series.
in the duo Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the finals, two different styles with their techniques, teams with obvious differences in results will also meet.
Ruben Omar Romano reads three defeats in the finals, he experienced both good and bad during his career, but he was able to achieve a decisive series on three occasions, but until now he left with an unacquired one, which is why this opportunity is extraordinary for him.
The Argentinian had to settle for the silver medal, remained a step behind the winners and performed with the same team of the following finals.
As a coach, the Santist strategist made it to his first finals in the Apertura 2002 tournament, when he had in his hands the strengths of Morelia, with which he submitted a total of 4-2 against Toluka; then in the clausura 2003 tournament he went back to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with Santos Laguna in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010 tournament, again against the "Devils" of Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Uzeners" (another nickname of the Deportivo Toluca club) after 210 minutes of the game undecided 2-2, after a series of shootings he got to the advantage of three on one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but eventually his three players missed the 11th step and the team thus suffered a turn of 4-3.
Ruben has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, therefore he would like to avoid the same fate and rid himself of the curse, so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says he is the most important institution to him.
"I want to come out as a winner, I do not want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I am obliged, and the title would of course be for me, but the first one is the most important", said the coach when he was asked about the numbers that he speaks in the finals against him.
in the living memory has the previous finale, in which, as confirmed, he learned a lot, "we learned a lesson that until the referee sings the end, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for the action, as well as players, because last time with two penalty payments, we were already ready to go out and I think we learned in this until the game is over, we can't celebrate".
He is not concerned that this series could decide in criminal shootings, he believes his players: "You never try to achieve a series of criminal kicks, you try to end up in a normal time, but sometimes there is no other option, and it is necessary to be prepared for it, we were prepared in the previous tournament, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, it left something in us and hopefully something like this will not happen this time."
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the other one and to taste the glory that the titles bring for the first time.
The United States amends the rules on the issue of visas
People will have to contact the Centres of Services for Visa Applicants before the interview at the Consular Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
As from 10 January 2011, the process of discussing visas will change to the United States Embassy and consulate.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Centres of Services for Visa Applicants (shortly from English ASC) before the interview at the Consular Department.
The staff of the ASC shall collect biometric information from the applicant and shall be evaluated before the interview by the Consular Department.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, among which the following are calculated:
The total costs of processing the visa will be lower, no longer a fee will be paid for agreeing a meeting, the second for processing the application and the other for delivery of the transport document.
The applicant shall pay only a single fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases with applications (including temporary staff visas) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to have an interview with a consular officer, but will only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and fingerprints will be taken.
Given that biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with the Consular Division will spend less time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa at the consulate in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee for the service of 26 dollars.

NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
An American space agency called for a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aviation and Space Office (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock by experts in astrobiology, science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, dissemination and future of life in the universe, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured us that she would present a "revelation that will cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life" which has triggered speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions, which were considered uninhabitable, and who could represent the possibility that they would someday become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It seems to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is precisely this ability that increases the probability that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have an atmosphere like that on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another, second form of life, different from that we know".
The Space Agency will announce the real extent of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of living on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examines Titan (the greatest month of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón produce an opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period has not even started yet, when the Congress formed an opposition block, led by MPs of the parties of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democratica, Czech "Page of the Democratic Revolution" - note.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Page of Work" - note.), Convergencia (Czech "Consent" note.) and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalve, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to the House.
Before the beginning of the 60th parliamentary session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo "played" against the reform of the Constitutional Act as it excludes them.
With this reform, they repeated, starting "Bapartism" because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santosova Aquilarová, coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council led by Salvador López Brito by PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - note Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally form political marginality from the drive of the PRI (Partido Revolutionary Institutional, Czech "Revolutionary Institution Party") and PAN.
He stated that during the following days they would talk to the representatives of the parties of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they would again be subject to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When I come here (the opposition coalition) I look at it because we are eliminated from any decision, they even do not want to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergencia stated that they were in agreement with the PRD, PT and Patron and would therefore form a plurality group.
It is not possible to allow Congress to continue after it was monopolistic, being now "duppolite".
The aspirations of the reform of the law are not to have endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as added by Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza by PT explained that the Congress has now become the "cash" of two - in a statement on the part of the PAN and PRI.
"It used to be ruled by only one side, now it's divided by two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Member's personality in order to give him a seat at the table.
"That the five Members, who are likely to be nine, may see us right now at five, should not remain outside because of the arched agreements, each in a different fraction, we have united ourselves to find a place at the table, because the problem is that in the reform they have formed and agreed, we are standing out, and we do not agree with this reform."
Issuing an additional 200,000 pesos for "contractor"
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay another check to the discussed owner of the company supplying the electromaterial.
Another check for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent to Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
Thus, the sum paid in this second half of the year of the owner of the company supplying the electromaterial will climb to 1.200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the town hall, this last check number 9258447 was sent on November 16 of this year, was exposed to a sum of 200.144.56 pesos and as its subject was stated "the compensation of outstanding payments".
Cashier Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay to this supplier, which was followed by the Supreme State Audit Office for sale at high prices, another amount.
What hasn't been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many more checks will be sent to Camach Palazuelos.
"There was no purchase now, only what we owed her, like the other suppliers", he said in one interview.
The last checks "resurfaced" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last on November 16.
Although this entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Government Notice, as stated by the law in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office to prevent other administrative authorities from using their services, the Treasury has ensured that it has not re-used the services of the City Hall supplier.
In the previous period, after 25 July, Noroeste published a revision of checks issued by the town hall to its suppliers, which revealed that during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, more than 10 million pesos were paid by Camach Palazuelos through 42 cheques between March 2008 and 9 July 2010.
She also made transactions with Gabrielpam, where she collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites necessarily need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of a foreign tourist because of the poor condition of the Sánchez Taboada resort in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the depths of Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asks the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and to show no port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the association of traders in the Zone Dorada region, recalled that they repeatedly asked to take care of the impression of the destination, and the bad things that tourists are finding here to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He stated that the bad condition of the streets and pavements affected tourists who walk around and see a mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicals don't know what it's like to close a business for one day, and they don't have any idea about the sales they're missing, otherwise they wouldn't be dealing with these issues for so long and without proper planning."
Hoteliér José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the downfall of the tourist caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The Council will have to take responsibility and prevent such a thing from happening again, it will have to focus on preventive maintenance, not just correct existing defects", he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, we also deserve a clean residence as citizens, the town hall should change its strategy for the maintenance of the city."
There are other places that look neglected and pitiful, he has noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblém and El Venadito (a monument, a statue of deer - note.)
"Today, in order for tourists to arrive, no matter only the promotion, we need to offer a good product, i.e. a city flowing with the purity of its beaches and streets, where a permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out", he said.
"The necessary attention has not been paid to this, and these facts stress something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places that need to be fixed in cooperation with the City Hall, saying that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to make it attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecretary of Tourist Promotion, said that saving tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space, but it will first be necessary to make these places more attractive and to list them in order to promote this destination."
IP requests Congress results
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CCE, would like Members to take great responsibility by setting an example in finding a better Sinaloy, in the various challenges facing the state.
The parliamentary term of full decent work and without agreements between the Parties and the State enforcement calls for the business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is in the convulsions and is facing great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period has been launched, composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI Members, 13 of PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from PT, one from the Convergencia side, and the last from the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations from the new members of the Congress, it is for them to be able to carry out decent leadership, with commitments to society and the various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalist patrons will not repeat.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordination Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 Members of Congress take great responsibility and set an example on the way for a better Sinalou in the various challenges they face.
"We expect Members to actually exercise their right, without agreement between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
He therefore talked about the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that would move the ruling forward in order.
"We want them to do decent work and to be primarily committed to companies and sectors, because they were the people of Sinaloy who gave them confidence in past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives would take all the strength to achieve the country's economic growth, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support job creation in a certain way".
As regards tourism, he asked that the new legislators should give him more weight in the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which, in addition, directly competes with agriculture".
In addition to spending funds on start-up tourist projects, Congress should help to deliver the state on the security and help with the Alcohol Act, which failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
Three Kings Looking for
Dolls, cars and bicycles are on the list of children's wishes in the family of the Coronad Valenzuels along with other toys.
Their parents will find it difficult to fulfill their ideas about the coming festival of the three kings, as their household contains exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaacs, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them toys and clothes for which they desire so much.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in Colonia Salvador Allende, in poor circumstances, because the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes we're having a hard time, because the husband's not lucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... I'm going out on the street this afternoon with the scavengers," said Cayetana Valenzuelová Andrade, the mother of the children.
A four-year-old Adelaide wishes a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
With regard to the 10-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a "monster" car for some time now, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesús, Cayetana would have wanted clothes of a size for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I wish this monster car', but I called him 'we'll see son' because it was very expensive', remembers Cayetan's sadness.
For older children who were just at school, it would be the perfect outfit and shoes.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, is 12, 10-year-old Isaiah size 10, whereas 8-year-old Miguel is 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so he could really use a five-and-a-half or six-year-old couple.
To help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronad Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Three Kings Search", and at the reception of the daily Noroeste bring a gift or cash money.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
Ten tours were carried out in Estonia, Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people were arrested and facing various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places that served to produce drugs.
"About 750 beds of Indian hemp, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that was used for production were confiscated", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the police in Quebec.
In total, 11 men and three women were arrested, both of which believed by the bosses of this entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Arrested persons had to arrive at the Sherbrooke Court Palace after their arrest.
They could face the accusations of the production of Indian hemp, its possession in order to trade, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These inspections took place following a long-term investigation, which took almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public, which allowed us to proceed to these arrests," said M. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers of the regional investigation department of the city of Estrie State Police Quebec, the State Police in Sherbrook and the police administration of the Sherbrooke Memphrémagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The Conservatives' Bill, which, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will obviously be overcome, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday have informed that they cannot support it.
"I rely on the Charter to a significant extent."
"I stand on the side of the party, which built a granite under your feet," said the head of liberals Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after a weekly meeting of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that a bill, as proposed, which would allow the detention of up to one year of any person coming from a ship, identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
The head of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he couldn't support the bill because he was heading towards the wrong goal.
"We are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we will see what the government will do," said M. Duceppe.
The NPD critic on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough for illegal immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree that we should take action against illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be the supporting part of another bill, C-35," Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservatives' Bill because it blames refugees and puts children in jail for at least one year", Chow explained.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties.
"Canadians tell MPs that they don't tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that Canadians take for granted, and they treat it like some kind of patron."
They expect Canada to take firm measures, responded by Minister Kenney.
The government has not put forward a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to choices leading to its rejection.
One Conservative said to the QMI that the government would ask for a vote that every Member who is against would answer from his position in front of his voters.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement that the creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and corruption, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public investigation committee on the issue.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, aims to ensure that this idea does not fall into oblivion: Québec intends to consult with the Department of Investment from New York in January next year.
Metropole has a permanent anti-corruption unit already since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement of many of us surprised us.
It should be noted that, at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
There was no more need for a public security critic, party PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to evaluate this announcement as "a king pulled out of a hat" and "a amateur solution inflated on his knees".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"He'll be happy with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness hearing at a public hearing.
"For more reason, Mr. Charest is confirming that he does not want to create this committee of inquiry, and people think, like you and me, that he is hiding something," he explains.
"The only means of achieving the creation of an investigative commission is the demise of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of High Officials.
In order to be able to come out of this dead end, he proposed Quebekah to grant special authority to the General Inspector so that he could investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the General Inspector", he decided.
It also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the Commissioner, who is allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the files of Charest's government.
Quebec would also, after Ottawa, amend the Criminal Code to be better adapted for this type of crime.
This requirement would be based on the Agent for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law for this type of investigation is not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his fellow judge, Rob Nicholson, was just dealing with some of the amendments linked to this file.
In Operation Spring 2001, which struck a group of bikers, although the Criminal Code was not yet regulated, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently had changes made to the Law on Gangery.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several water flows have been under strict control due to severe collisions that have fallen since Tuesday in several provinces.
On Wednesday afternoon, there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road's bent.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions hit heavy rainfall, i.e. it rained from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 further millimetres were not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the valley of Outaouais were hit the most.
It could fall up to 100 millimetres.
If we add these precipitations to the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be afraid of flooding in some water streams.
The Quebek rescue service announced a warning on Wednesday night against the dangers of flooding for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have become the subject of flood emergency and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière caused a strong collision of the distribution of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was torn down as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences must have been evacuated.
In Outaouais the spilling of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Emergency services are on alert and oversee the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, Security Adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Centre issued a warning on Wednesday against strong floods for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebeck radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered partial failure before the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements concerning social assistance and Haitians and, as well as for gross expression during broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Council considers that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "inaccuracy of social assistance and inappropriate negative representations of Haitians of gross expression which does not correspond to broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussions on suicide, including the transmission of the names of the two persons who took their lives, had not infringed the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Council received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasting period between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken following a complaint by the Common Front of the beneficiaries of the social support of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts on the broadcast were inaccurate.
The moderators must submit reliable information, not misleading.
Regarding suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most of the members of the Commission concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the broadcast of 'Dupont's mid-term reports' have encountered a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no complaint against him.
The last dispute concerned a statement following the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort thus entered a media shootout that triggered many reactions.
The moderator CHOI stated that he had not sent any gift to help the Haitians, because we can't be sure that the needy will actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an undue negative picture of the Haitians.
"I've already done my three-day delay."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," said the host.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression on the broadcast.
Anyway, the CHOI-FM radio broadcast has worked together "out of its responsibilities".
For the station, which will have to notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King of the Kung-Fuvà Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originating in Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely strange run.
Atlet, which stands out in the "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), enters into kickbox and Thai boxing on dads and ringies all over the world and seeks new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explaining Zemmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to study with professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches a little everywhere because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently this person, who works as a security guard and as a helper to UPS, has just delivered bad news to his opponents when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the kickbox category full contact and the Thai box," he said.
"I am currently preparing for the San Shou World Cup in China."
"There were invited rivals who ended up with the first four at the last World Cup in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009.
"In 2005, I finished eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, in China, I ended up in a tournament at 5:00 a.m., while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third, added."
"It's interesting that I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'm going to be the first one this year or next year!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches of fists and legs, as well as throwing on the ground, are permitted.
The games are held traditionally on the platform and rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer of this form of struggle is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
As much as Nacer Zemmal has to keep only one result in his career, he boldly confirms his participation in the "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a nice guy."
"It's kind of equivalent to Stade Lumpinee."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first game, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg) before he suffered a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, analyzing."
"There are four rivals per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"Wind semi-finals will be in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will compete to be crowned the only champion, king of kung fu."
450 million contracts without public competition
Hydro-Quebec agreed, by mutual agreement, to 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this avalanche, more than 100 contracts are just a consortium created by companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which acquired the most important contract, a project management contract totalling $295 million without a public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of the Énergie gérance, was authorised in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Quebec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for managing this significant hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Énergie gérance" consortium obtained a lucrative contract without any publication of the competition.
For the Quebec side, a complaint about a consortium of enterprises is putting us in a serious ethical problem, which risks preventing competition and causing price increases..
"It's a new way to realize collusion and eliminate competition."
"This means that people, who are no longer making side agreements, are already making them openly," said PQ Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says it carries heavily on how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected this afternoon, denying that it would be in this collusion agreement.
"I have my own way," she said, "and she claimed that PQ was "unfair" and "missed accuracy."
She said "that would be the least of it" to apologize to PQ.
The recipe to create a consortium is common practice around the world.
This is usually an alliance, limited in time, which allows two or more companies to group their mutual expertise in order to respond to a call for proposals for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the scope of the work.
The construction is already running and has to be planned by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be acknowledged that the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formulation of consortia in engineering advice is the subject of government investigations.
If we fly over the business register of the Quebek companies at the speed of the business, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanently created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
With regard to the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau underlined, in particular, the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is a typical special dynamics of the labour force and that Hydro-Quebec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), provided an explanation that will make us splinter our forehead over the fact that the project management contract was concluded in mutual agreement.
"If you're going to the competition and if there's not enough participants in the tender competition, your prices may be higher."
"You have two choices: that is, you collect the people who are in that contract as participants of the competition, and that you say, "Let's make a satisfactory and good deal."
"But the main idea is that it is important not the price, but the competence of the people," Mr. Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebek Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification of Le Devoir, he counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular laboratories carrying out soil samples analyses.
SNC-Lavalin collected 22 contracts, of which Genivar obtained 16 of them, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in the "Énergie gérance".
All contracts have been concluded.
A total of $449 783 344, including a contract with Énergie gérance at $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard indicated that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Groupe and Axor) are "very well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau released a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "finance" it, rather than specifying that it is more of a management staff.
The responsible consumption barometer - "green" label does not inspire trust
More green but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer trusts very little in the sustainable development actors, but also in the 'unbiased' brands and environmental certification, to be guided in the selection of products.
The worst part is that even if we buy in the media universe, which urges us to consume more socially responsiblely, this media universe is calling for a lack of reliable information, a failure to fulfil its obligations even as a brake for its commitment, states the Baromètre responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Even though consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec who are trying to sell them still don't trust them much
Two-thirds of us actually say that they don't believe in promises from companies regarding the environment, simply because the green advertising of companies is finding a measuring tool developed by the Observatory for responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands which are referred to as ecologically responsible, states Barometer.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this subject is adopted as serious only 14.6% of the people of Quebec.
Information on responsible consumption seems, however, to be a priority in stimulating this site of consumption, which is currently being revived by almost a third of the Lebanese consumers.
Indeed, vacuum and the questionable nature of information would ease the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Baromètre identified at a higher price of these products.
After all, a third of the people of Quebekuse are distrustful of the data on products or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, change the brand name of one or more products, thus responding to their beliefs.
61% of them preferred shopping with traders in their neighborhood and preferred buying food grown in their region, says Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumer Québek is happy to present himself as the king of recycling, which seeks the least possible environmental impact by taking care of animal protection.
But apparently their social and environmental conscience remained outside their car, says Baromètre: in 2010, barely 28% of the people of Quebec reported that they are using mass transport or recommending the use of a car to drive at least two people, in order to protect nature.
The walk and the bike also supported 39.1% of participants in this extensive investigation of behavior who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which we asked for financial participation in the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris of Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The Developper company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a gift of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to buy out the cinematographic complex on the Saint-Laurenta boulevard and which proved its mission as a lover of film art, did not get what it required.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government is proposing a loan that would have been lower, some of the original expectations that could have built a basis for viable solutions under favourable conditions and resources from the state.
The first action plan and the requirement for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications were already revised to reduce.
The proposal and the action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre, President of the Society for the Development of Enterprises in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus has until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must indeed be rejected.
It is recalled that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec opposed the direct investment of the State in order to support the buy-back of eXcentris, considering that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project when he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, a number of participants in the discussion called for substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, was given to his cinemas within ten years of financing the construction of the complex, which could have been a reason to change by the State's Financial Council.
The lack of halls for independent films is loud in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to acquire a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, manages a campaign to mobilise funds into the private sector, in the belief that they will cut 700 000 dollars for pushing acquisitions.
Since spring 2009, the only of three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on 27 February next year and to project the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remind Le Devoir, and so he ignores himself, so he and his group think about the designs for the shrinkages that are being made to him.
Raised curtain to Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic sources of American knowledge through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of less valuable Canadians to Americans, but with the same punch they reveal their sense of superiority to Canada.
The American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when it comes to voting, and they believe that the visit of President Obama helped the conservative government to adopt its 2009 budget!
Four new reports between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday being interpreted as a public impression, also provide sensitive details to get under each other's skin.
The communication dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of an election campaign, details at which point the United States is not part of the bets discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gives a few explanations to this situation.
"The Canadian complex of less valuables, almost stuck, makes possible political leaders to talk about internal bets, instead of realizing that these elections concern the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign) ", writes.
"The United States are, therefore," concluded, "the proverbial elephant in these elections: omnipresent but potentially too dangerous to speak of."
The ambassador understands this 'deafening silence' all the less that both countries are maintaining intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or even better leader of a party to manage these important relations should be a key factor for voters to think about when they go to elections."
Another expression of this importance can be found in the report sent by Terry Brees, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa on 22 January 2009.
"Your journey will help ensure that the government maintains its vote of confidence at the beginning of February, on a federal budget to which Canada will publicly grant its first deficit in more than ten years, due to a recovery plan of between $30 and $40 billion", writes M. Brees.
There is no mention that the government had to postpone the pre-event meeting of Parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties condition their survival with the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of an increasingly negative picture that casts on the United States dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where not too clever references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or kidnappings for the purposes of violent interrogation at the CIA can be observed.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was prepared to accept some of the prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but based on the "case-by-case" principle.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, a state secret."
"The secret has accepted that the file will revise."
Let us finally note that the people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "destroyed".
It spread out and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
A World Lighting Recovery Plan
Yesterday, in Cancún, the UN proposed a plan to restore home lighting, lighting of shops and industrial space in 100 countries in order to achieve a greenhouse effect reduction (GES), which corresponds to almost one-third of the further limit that needs to be achieved for stabilising the planet's climate from now on until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major specific projects that the UN wants to enforce in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-realised reduction commitments on the part of industrialised countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the hot bulbs, which monopolize 50 to 70% of the market, replace them with fluo-comprehensible or, even better, light bulbs with light-emitting diodes (DELs or "LEDs" in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would be broken down.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
It's equivalent to 70% of the emissions from the car park on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, were involved in voluntary reduction plans, which should allow the GES to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract 5 Gt from this balance in order to achieve the stabilisation of climate heating by 2020 at 2 degrees Fahrenheit in order to rule out that it will not get out of control.
In the hot bulbs 95% of the energy is scattered in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With the fluo compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new DEL bulbs, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluo compact bulbs last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
The new light bulbs with DEL, the one that introduced Philips this week - this company allegedly participated in a UN study - have an estimated life of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot light bulb, which gives us an idea of a possible savings plan for a replacement that would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with the rheostats and radiate less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations to fluo compact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers set up collections.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluo compact bulb, but rather the heat-fired coal-fired power plants that release many mercurys needed to produce electricity wasted in the heat-extinguishing bulbs.
In the United States alone, these headquarters are putting in circulation 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report also gives details of the profits that each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 of a thermal power plant, which would cost 2.5 billion
Côte d'Ivoire eagerly expects the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General emphasises the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the preliminary results without delay, stressed the spokesperson of the UN President."
"He asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressures of some foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had the latest date - Wednesday midnight - passed without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's revolution.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the president of CEI on TV confirmed that the commission was "going to work" so that it could announce the results.
In the middle of the world, the calls for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and a member of the opposition by Alaskan Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is relying on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of the "deceptive" vote in the north, managed by the former insurgents of the New Army (FN) since the failed state coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of a presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters, practiced by FN (New Army) in the north of the country, discouraged the supporters of the President of Côte d'Ivoire from voting.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, the opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is ruled by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who demented any connection with the former insurgents, condemned the delay in the announcement of the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
Its allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered a loss and that it would be illegal to file a complaint to the Constitutional Council after he prevented the electoral commission from transmitting the results.
The second round of the presidential elections held on Sunday was considered as a coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that has been divided into two-half years.
In the middle of the political faction of Côte d’Ivoire, the United Nations pointed out that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, on October 31, as a 38% winner, compared to 32% for Alaskan Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in the third quarter of France.
The unemployment rate in France according to the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by provisional data with the correction of seasonal deviations (CVS) published on Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed has reached 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate is increased by 0.1 points.
In the wider range, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter but wish to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work and whether they are looking or not.
The situation of the current young people on the labour market was still increasing with a new increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% in overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed.
As far as seniors are concerned, they have seen a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months as per year), 482,000 people from 50 years above and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population benefited from the stability of unemployment to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following the polemice on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is being charged and put into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the head of waste management companies and a brother of the PS Board of Directors Bouches-du-Rhône, was accused and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of a public procurement investigation, allegedly long-term acquired.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of the abuse of the company's assets, the abuse of public funds and public property, the covert, the provision of bribes, the receipt of bribes in order to influence the office and the holding of ammunition, states his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is a warrior and insists that the judge explain to himself all the questions that he intends to ask him and not some delusion."
"It is easy to pursue it for many criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove it", said his attorney, Florence Rault, for AFP before questioning his client.
Mr Guérini, through his lawyers, stated that he had sent a brief message to the judge before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simona, his client never did anything but ensure that the landfill he was supposed to manage was working.
As regards the award of contracts or the destination of funds linked to their operation, he never knew of such a thing, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, former CEO of the Aubagne agglomeration services, was accused on Wednesday for abuse of public funds and a set, and left free, under judicial supervision, to meet, protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client was able to explain all the facts he was being blamed for."
"The investigating judge looks into it and leaves it at large," said his attorney, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four more people were charged and released at night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with the fact that they were under judicial supervision for two of them, said Deputy Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption".
Two officers from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are accused, one for "the alienation and abuse of the company's assets", the other for "complotion in the abuse of public funds".
Finally, a business associate of Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "covering the abuse of the company's assets".
Among the people confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been charged in the parallel case of fraudulent public procurement concerning Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company helped to launder money from a large-scale gangsterry.
The investigation is conducted in several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public contracts, in particular on waste matters.
From the source of a close investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Abuagne, as well as from some cities in the Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée Palace exaggerated Syria's mediation
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the allocation of the Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", united views in France, introduced diplomacy into a combat emergency and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this has been closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of tourists).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavanda, an Iranian prisoner in France and sought US justice for the substantiation of material for the benefit of Iran’s nuclear programme.
Finally, they are subject to a sharp light the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media in order to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for it.
The Diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the headline "Iran:French comments on the way to a solution in the case of hostages".
The adviser from the Elysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of American diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend that Americans do just as much to bring their own citizens back to their homeland by force detained in Iran.
"Do the noise," they say, "continuously express the words "the fundamental rights of man" in the media, "the innocence," "the immediate liberation."
The Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image, must be brought into difficulty.
"Do it all the more, the more they ask you to stop it."
Since attempts have been made to negotiate through discreet channels, "it will solve nothing," the Iranians are "masters on evasive maneuvers".
Mr. Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is an "Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail".
It announces that the release of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August on the day of the French Embassy's refuge) "will require the payment of a large financial amount to the Iranians" (a guarantee of EUR 230,000).
And they're going to announce that the Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "arrest about 1800 more French living in Iran in the future," he says.
August 28, 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
The information spreads: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who is claimed by the United States to have been banished for illegal trafficking in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judgment of a judge.
Like many observers, the American Embassy is asking about this worrying consensus.
The expansion of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, who pursues illegal Iranian networks to acquire material for the nuclear program.
France agreed to a deal?
Liberation of an Iranian for the liberation of a young French woman?
In his next interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4th, François Richier makes sure that's not the case.
The Elysian palace, as it says, was not only "surprised by this decision of the judge," but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"Consultations have taken place between the Presidential Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the decision of the court", he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The advisor of the Elysée Palace dials the phone number, hangs the telephone phone and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the buildings of the Iranian embassy in Paris."
At the time of the prison of Klotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elysian Palace is developing its efforts, negotiating, through communications and organized "loops" to the media to convince the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play "significant" and "influenced" the role of "mediator".
Americans observe this activity, not without irony, and note that manipulation bears its fruit, because several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 provokes the media "blest" of French officials.
On what is the "gratefulness" rate expressed against M. Assad, he asks the embassy in Paris.
"Even though their statements are full of praised French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "to validate President Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", analyses.
A policy applied in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "how far the Syrian role" Paris is trying to "show Syria what praisers it can earn when it plays a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also "to sow grain of disputation between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows that from a very good source.
August 11, François Richier confessed to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But still, we thanked them."
"This should at least create confusion and confusion among the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts her at the Elysian Palace.
In the communal, he thankes the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our countrywoman".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecival", which will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, stated responsible government officials.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December so that it can request companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight by persons under the age of 16, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", said Jo Rin, the head of the Ministry, who has the bill in charge.
Online games will be newly available from 6am.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, specified.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to reduce their daily time in access to these games for young people whose parents request it, has been complemented by a responsible worker.
It will also make available to those who ask for it free of charge, allowing them to limit their time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "disabled" countries, and daily press brings together the various facts associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is an undeniable champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games in the face of 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
Full of unrest due to suspicion of corruption, Fif’s Executive Committee sets up, on Thursday, the World Cup host country in 2018 and 2022, a choice that is politically politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risk getting ahead of the technical criteria.
The matter is certain that the FIF Royal Competition in 2018 will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping that it will succeed in conquering the new territory (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to be planted in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities to participate in delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, Head of Government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an idea of the scale of economic and political betting around the world.
The negotiations behind the scenes face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
It is difficult for the rest to establish a hierarchy by candidates.
According to Fif's assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons won't have too much weight for 22 members of the Executive Board at the hour for voting.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelation, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temaria et Amos Adamu) may thus have destroyed the chances of its country, the cradles dug, which so far hosted the world championship only once a year.
The BBC put a crown on Monday when it broadcast a document that "taped on a pin" three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fif unhappy and bring English leaders with David Cameron first and foremost into trouble.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will succeed in repeating the move that his predecessors succeeded in acting as Tony Blair, who managed to win for London the 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Will this intense activity suffice to give England a new shine of her name to CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the couple Spain-Portugal do not miss the triumphs of the already prepared stadiums, its well-being (the 1982 World Championship in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the dark economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the championship would not move to Zurich and publicly declared "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal statements only barely twisted against the accusations of the English press against the CE (European Commission).
"We'll throw mud at them, try to compromise them," said Mr Putin.
For 2022, the United States seems to be a logical favorite with considerable 1994 experience.
The highest performance of the world's economy, the headquarters of Fif's main sponsors, seems to have a great lead before Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have made a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for both countries, which together in 2002 have undergone a "test".
Another threat: granting the 2026 World Cup to China, who wishes Fif horrificly, has made the Asian chance for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar, who pulled a big ace out of his sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue her expansion into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for poor TV fees (due to time shifts) paid by European countries, creating a momentum for Fif.
Second mandate: transparency (confidence)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand made it appear he was hesitant.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The mandate of the Elysian Palace calls on someone else.
The current Head of State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of the secrets associated with the Presidency's function.
It is therefore necessary to act as if doubts persisted.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, without wanting to believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends made claims not to exclude the third mandate.
On November 15th, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "he will decide sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As it reminds the members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday night in the Elysée Palace, the perspective of the "two mandates" has sown little fever.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the Constitution's 2008 amendment limited the number of five-year term of office to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not a notice.
It is not the first time in such meetings that it is like a humorous tone of presidential elections.
"In the worst case scenario, or at best, you have seven and a half years ahead of you with me", he switched in July 2009.
Rebels in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; he will not make him a candidate or less.
If they're making comments, it's because of the double truth.
Accelerating the path to the PSC candidacy, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to Ségolèn Royal's cradle that's pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
It is, on the contrary, because its candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want an arrangement in combat formations rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would prefer the François Fillon candidacy before Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we don't discuss this matter with the UMP," reacted immediately and obsessively people from the nearest neighborhood of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes a possible defeat, he will not run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," says Alain Juppé, balanced with the obvious.
Euro: The European Central Bank has been forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of Central in the year should have been the opportunity to specify the conditions for recovery from the crisis or, at least, the notification of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European debt obliges, without a doubt, the Institute for the issuance of securities will not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation already strained on European securities markets.
In that case, the political price would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in helping to resolve the crisis in the claims of European countries.
She did not want to say whether she thought the bank could do more, for example by increasing their sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners...".
In the evening before that, in Brussels, in his hearing with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not prove more eloquent in terms of its intentions and satisfied that he stated that the programme for the purchase of state titles on the secondary market "will continue" and that "we will see how we will decide" during the meeting held this Thursday.
One certainty: the Central European Bank will keep an eye on its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of bonds from the central European bank has doubled to almost EUR 1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the unwiseness of the agreementors on the market, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem’s central banks have bought EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among the agreement-makers on the market for the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists expect no significant change of course.
If the operations of loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central Bank's arsenal, the latter bank shall proceed to the unlimited provision of liquidity under generous conditions and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would take the risk of a short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, the economist of Commerzbank.
"The progressive exit reported during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", presupposes Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
The European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of the purchase of its bonds in order to revive the weak market in order to plan its interventions on the public debt market," adds Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets, the euro area has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to replace, at any cost, the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the burning of paid performances by the states, which are among the most fragile", the important bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates were to take off, countries would be even more concerned to reduce their debt instead of stabilising it.
It's saving the euro for this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi has its backs
After the start of the week, Italy’s worrying situation was a little relaxed, with a reverse flow of bond interest for 10 years yesterday.
Return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of the regions said that they had heard Giulius Tremonti as he qualified the situation as "unsolvable" and expected a "unforeseeable" weekend, which he then demented.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest reached a record of 210 basis points, and the price of the contracts against bankruptcy (CDS) went up to 263 points, which caused some excitement in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the derogation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, has declared himself "too busy" with the "turbulent development of markets" and a possible disease from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and uncirculationally, its problem is the lack of growth and insignificant fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and exposes it to the risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is currently expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the general government deficit will still represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (2.7% instead of 2.7%).
From there, the reputation of a new summary of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounts to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken", says Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For the moment, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
"The cornerstones of her economy are fine and her calculations are correct, we have repeated this for a long time", assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Governing Board of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem or short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation effort required in Italy is less than the effort required from other countries", notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the main economist of the OCDE.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face the proposal to express distrust to the Chamber of Deputies, and after that, they could begin to organise the elections that are expected at the end of March.
Thus, a period would be launched, not enough for the adoption of a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde re-emphasised it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think the Europeans demonstrated it on Sunday throughout the day and night, they are clearly very committed, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion regarding interest on European government bonds has brought water to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's notation office announced that it could degrade the Portuguese debt record, a target that is most focused on various speculations.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and clear policy, based mainly on banking systems", states economists Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more reason that "political time is running slower than market time."
The consciousness of this intermittent context and the danger that it hides strengthen European countries' debate towards strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers, the most concerned by the problem, and on a wider scale with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
With regard to the Eurogroup meetings (Eurogroupe) and the Ecofin group from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is today.
The programme includes the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, took a trip to Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors from the Far East of the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of this trip is not to raise the funds, it is certainly preparing the land to achieve this goal.
The first issue of the FESF securities is expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, the U.S. official informed Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilised funds by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries which are primarily concerned, Portugal and Spain are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are linked to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid, different from Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at any cost, asking for international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms needed to regain their continued confidence.
The capital participants in the European funds are finally talking about options that are available to speed up the process of normalising markets with sovereign bonds.
On its way to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea of EUR 750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, and the Union would not hesitate to touch again the stock of securities.
The Barclays Capital economists, the actor of the very first trading plan for European sovereign debt, believe that an additional of around EUR 100 billion would be enough, "a better way" to provide financial liquidity directly.
The means exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidised to date by EUR 60 billion.
The Council, which has every chance of being tried in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 regions have orange alerts.
Snow rations still cause problems in transport, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that it will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties now have an orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres a la Vienne, joined the 20 counties that have already announced an orange emergency, 18 from Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, there are considerable snowfalls causing problems in the north of La Gironde and the Charentes forest and weakly snowing on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and covers from 1 to 3 cm, places from 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are hit.
The tides of snow are large enough to cause transport difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, predicts Météo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some counties banned the passage of heavy freight transport - to trucks over 7.5 tonnes with the Guingamp-Lannion route and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to the police, and the police recommend to take off with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardia for Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, no specific measures are foreseen to limit freight transport.
The district office "invites all car drivers to the greatest possible caution on the roads and to adjust the driving nature of the road".
The Civil Aviation Directorate-General (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel their flights to Roissy Airport on Thursday 25% of their flights to Orly, Paris, and 10% to Orly because of expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends passengers using air transport services to contact their company.
Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning in the UK.
Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Ever since the debate on modernising transport to Ile-de-France has been happening, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
We are reminded, in particular, of the 23 billionth Grand Paris Metro to build the Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to start, the State announced a grant of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, it is an amount that enables SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source for contracts.
Today we are finally getting to the first additions.
The financial rectification act 2010, which examines the Financial Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax on equipment and increasing the tax on offices to Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The income from this interest is EUR 117 million a year".
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists, "to be modernised to increase the revenue obtained from it and to affect Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
A delusion.
That's not calculated in the text.
We're four billion away.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are connected to EUR 4 billion from the capital subsidy, which will be mobilised by the State and inserted into Société du Grand Paris according to the project", we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
We do not find this system shocking at SGP.
"From the moment we have created income (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the study for three years and then dig up to 4 billion, it explains here."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
SGP considers that 4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billions promised belong to yet absent subscribers, risk causing a somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Vengeance hackers and vindictive spies
The WikiLeaks case has a dual meaning.
On the one hand, there is a clear scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal in the face of hypocrisy, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at international level and anticipates the future of controlled regression.
But let's move on with the order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this confirms the fact that each document compiled by secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelation" of the Americans about Berlusconi's sexual life is what everyone could read in any newspaper for months (all except these two Berlusconi owns), and the unblemished caricature profile of Kadafi has long been a subject for cabaret artists..
The rule that secret documents can only consist of reports already known is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not just in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Temples or Zednars) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And that is not only because the author of the occult texts does not like looking for new information (not even knowing where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who engage in the occult believe only what they already know and confirm what they have learned before.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same goes for classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or limited spirit) head of the Secret Service (and if not, he could, as I know, be an editor in the newspaper Libération) who considers it true only what he admits.
The high-secret information about Berlusconi, which the U.S. Embassy sent to the State Department, was the same information that Newsweek published a week before.
So why was there so much fuss about the revelations about these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can make calls or fly out on a plane to a joint dinner, has lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in the representation, have transformed into a spy center.
Any viewer watching films about the investigation knows very well that it only seems to be ignored by the mediocrity.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly, the disgraceful duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most top secret information from the most powerful countries in the world represents a hard strike, not negligible, for the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victim and his "executor".
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, it was possible to take all the power, like some big brother who controlled every move of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven since, thanks to the ability to control every move through the phone, every transaction made, every hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, has become a complete victim of the wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it is now that even the tombs with the most classified information of the mighty cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a avenger of a citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can you maintain power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is an uncontained secret (and that the secret will never be revealed without content); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious secret, because it is drawn out of public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was uncontained secrets means to take away all its power.
WikiLeaks made no mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this wound of the power provided be so significant?
Clearly, in the future, states will not be able to send online sensitive information - this would be equal to its publication on a poster glued at the corner of the street.
But it is also quite clear that, with current technologies, it is unnecessary to hope that you can keep a message hidden on the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of their colleagues.
How can private and sensitive messages be kept in the future?
I know very well that for the moment my forecast belongs to science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I must imagine government officials who carry on discreetly carrying out formalities on uncontrollable routes and carry only those reports that they know from memory or rather hide rare information in the heel of the shoe.
The information will be stored in unique copies in key drawers: quite speaking, an attempt to spy in the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving backwards, that is, backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephones).
The videos (analogues) allowed cinema lovers to capture the film step by step, move it forward and back and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, while now CD (digits) allow only to jump on chapters, that is to say macroproportions.
Through the quick trains, we will reach Milan from Rome in three hours, while on the way by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn vehicles.
Last comment.
At other times, the press tried to understand what was planned in the secret of the embassy.
Now it's the embassy requesting confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked her financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try and keep your promises to quickly unlock financing (fast start financing or premature financing), implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were discovered
In the Copenhagen Agreement, advanced countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion for three years and France has promised EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million a year).
At the start of COP16, the EU drew a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to financing a fast start: a report detailing the action of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operations undervalued and valued at their true value: advanced countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do them equally and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which brings it to the right path to complying with its promise of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we'll find that things are a lot more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, these funds are 'new and additional' to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no match in what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered the 2009 reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million to it for three years.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or deadlines at the level of public aid for development.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there are no references to expenditures of previous periods or to the global level Public aid for the development of d'Aide public au développement.
In particular, the overall amount of France’s support towards developing countries can remain unchanged (or even decrease), has to comply with its commitment to the financing of "new and additional"...
Another decisive element is the division into donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ borrowed is equal to 1€ donated.
Clearly, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be documented for certain investments which are profitable (often projects related to reducing emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present the one euro that we get as equivalent to the one euro that we give... , we should not understand it as our commitments, but as the price of the loan to the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France can only give such justifications: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million, of which 91.5% is a loan (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of the donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan on such a scale.
Germany has requested 46% of this, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are complying with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives 1€ to satisfy its promise, France will only give 10 cents and consider this effort to be comparable.
A beautiful gibberish piece!
For a summary, in its financing "fast start", France operates with double scoffing: on the one hand, with the development of a stock in time and on the other hand with a real financial burden.
Although it only spends EUR 36.1 million, it can convince that it spends EUR 420 million of 'new and additional' in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate when they only borrow?) and when negotiating, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter of early funding is only a small question, relatively short, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But it could be a grain of sand in an enormous machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever this is, it is necessary to draw on the knowledge from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce the change in its way of keeping the accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of compliance with its obligations and respect and justice towards the other countries of the European Union.
But first of all, France should prevent discussions on long-term financing deposits (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not avoid the question of "additionality" or how to account for loans.
France should change its position in order to become as progressive with these deposits as others.
Everyone is therefore putting hope in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will be coming to Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement of France's fast start and its vision of 'additionality' and the use of loans could lead to an increase in the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
The pesticide alert that the children eat.
A ten - year - old child eats 81 different chemicals one day, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the association of future generations (ex-rights movement and the preservation of future generations).
The association, which points out that its results "does not have significant statistical value given the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processed issue", bought between July and September food commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack for one child about ten years old in supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water daily - have been analysed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The plate balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five substances belong to clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive for internal dispersion (PE) glands, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we see that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminating substances, possibly carcinogenic, and/or the EP is overwhelming", the Association states.
For breakfast butter and tea with milk contain in themselves about ten résidues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as is the case with about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, referred to as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including in France, a prohibited fungicide.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in lunches, where studies have discovered traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat snacks, canned tuna, and even mushrooms and gum were snuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap analysis, the presence of nitrates and chloroforms was revealed.
The salmon steak for dinner was "the richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to warm up the food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this "contamination cocktail" is likely to be underestimated, according to the study.
The Ecological Europe-Greening Association (EE-LV) proposed to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increasing of civilizational diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) study examined the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereal.
