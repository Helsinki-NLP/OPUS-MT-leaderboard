An 18-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco
This week, the 27 - year - old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was a local store.
However, the victim’s brother says that he has no idea who would want to hurt him, adding: “He has finally started to succeed. ”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, reported the medical examiner's office.
The San Francisco Police Department has reported that this is a violent death and an investigation is taking place.
The brother of the victim Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who had previously been a serial chef in Boston, had obtained his dream chef's job at Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The spokesman of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that they were "shocked and destroyed" by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss them very much," said the spokesman.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank had first slept in the hostels, but that he had recently “been successful.”
"He found an apartment, he dated a girl," said Louis Galicia for KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any fights.
He was a brother who took things the way they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an uncut diamond that radiated every day," he said.

The Czech Railways invested over 31 billion in the modernisation of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the last six years, the state carrier has invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernisation of vehicles.
Three cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, the Czech Railways have invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernisation of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was shown to reduce average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic wagons.
A larger proportion of the investments were put by the carrier in regional transport, where around 60 percent of the money was spent, then 40 percent invested in the renewal of the long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is now 19 years old.
However, modernized older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of vehicles were not calculated, the average age of driving vehicles of ČD would increase by 10 years.
A little older are on average passenger wagons whose average age is 23 years old when modernising.
If only age from the date of production were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33,4 years.
However, classic sets consisting of wagons and locomotives have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways in recent years and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, locomotives remained from 280 to 223 pieces, and the number of classic wagons from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year also decreased.
In particular, the carrier disposed of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these vehicles scrapped.
From the investments planned by ČD in the vehicle park in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to set up on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or the framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic fast track.
The contract covers the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electrical units.
The authorities of the fourth year know about illegal advertising, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely helpless, they admit it.
For the fourth year the editor of the online journal Aktuálně.cz has been watching the story of the billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where there is not only a touristly interesting walk in the tree crowns, but also an Olympic park.
The highway managers know they're standing there black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds of similar ads all over the country, maybe thousands.
According to officials, there's a bad law on guilt that makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
The need is first a complex bureaucratic wheel.
In the meantime, the company changes its name, and the office is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few meters and the official process has to start again.
Roads and motorways management admitted a quarter of a year ago: the main road from České Budějovice to Lipno stands on our land near the state road advertising billboard in black.
But not even three months were enough for officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one cares if they're standing right next to the road, in a 50-meter protection zone where nothing can stand for safety.
Road managers say they can't deal with the billboard because of the leaky law.
Maybe load him up and take him away.
"We must not just afford this," says the spokesperson of the Road and Motorways Directorate Nina Ledvinová, referring to a complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be preceded by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began to monitor the online diary Aktuálna.cz in the spring, while it is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In southern Bohemia alone, the editor calculated dozens of similar mobile advertisements located against the rules just next to or near the road.
Likewise, other regions are involved.
"We have trouble forcing the company to remove the pilgrims," says Jiří Klasa, Head of the Transport Department of the Czech-Udědějovice Regional Office, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to Klasa, there's a hole in the law that binds officials.
First, he has to address billboard owners in a difficult way to put the ad away.
But the company's bosses are often impeccable or know a trick, which has already been described in the past when the issue became more detailed: just a mobile stand with advertising can move a few meters and the officials can throw the previous call to remove the black advertising into the basket.
That's because the Bureau has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and coordinates suddenly disagrees, they view it as a new device and we must reach the owner again," explains Jiří Klasa.
The new law won't help.
The change could have brought a new law which, from September next year, will ban billboards at the motorways and limit them to the first-class roads.
The critics point out that the rules on combating illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same as before.
And the authorities won't be so relieved.
Companies can continue to make tens to hundreds of millions of crowns per year on leases of illegal areas, and no one can.
For example, the billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
The officials know it well: the Czech-School Magistrate currently conducts three administrative procedures for black billboards.
A 300-thousand fine is a threat to the company.
These are more advertisements that have been placed in the Class I protection zone without authorisation.
The procedure has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, Head of the Transport Department of the Czech-Budějovice Magistrate.
The advertising that he is interested in is not yet set up among these cases, but he will most likely be joining them soon.
According to ŘSD spokesperson Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written requests for removal, and the case will then be on the regional table and then probably on to the magistrates.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't get in touch.
She doesn't take the mail, and she canceled the official headquarters of Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the post office of the company went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representative of Hyundai.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard leases and offers to advertisers, however, has refused any connection in the past.
In spring this year, when ŘSD began to be interested in advertising Lipno at the initiative of Aktuálně.cz, Fischer had state officials send a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the company is allegedly based.
However, no one has heard from this address to this day from the motorway administrators.
It's a futile fight.
Similar silence or opaque changes in residences are not uncommon.
We gradually fined one company for two million crowns a few years ago.
But she changed the name and the I.C.O., and there was nothing to deal with.
The enforcer returned the case, the ads kept on, maybe elsewhere.
We are quite helpless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, one of the officials admits anonymity on condition.
No one is yet dealing with the amendment to the law in this respect.
Currently.cz has spoken to several Members who have been interested in the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the deadline for the maintenance of billboards at the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic not only for national, but also regional and municipal policies.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions, on the other hand, they need them for advertising in election campaigns.
I don't hold the relatively well-established impression that when something doesn't work, you need to change the laws.
Farmers harvest less grain this year, but more rape and poppy, estimate the statistics.
According to estimates from the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest of cereals will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet this year’s crop exceeds the average over the last five to ten years.
On the contrary, the rape harvest (by 3.9 per cent) and poppy (2.5 per cent) will be higher.
The harvest of cereals will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is based on an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The initial estimate of a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a decimal drop against last year.
Last year's cereal harvest was above average.
This year's crop exceeds the average in the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, this year the rape and poppy harvest will be higher.
Rape growers harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they received 1,256 million tons under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year.
The expected fall in cereal production is caused by both a reduction of the hectares yield by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the seed area.
This year, farmers donkeyed three percent less fields.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to yield 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers put her in more fields.
However, a lower hectares yield will be signed for the decline, which will fall to 6,04 tonnes.
Roughly a fifth decrease in statistics is expected in spring barley, which is most often used in beer production.
The reduction in the yield is 15.2 per cent, but also a lower hectares.
Winter barley, on the contrary, will be born 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of rye will also grow.
Rape crops are estimated at 1,305 million tonnes, which is more than last year.
The area of planting has increased by 7.3 percent.
But the hectar income will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rape crop exceeds a 10-year average of 13.3 per cent, sowing on the area by a third more extensive than ten years ago.
In the last four years, the fields of poppy have also increased.
The farmers sent him 35.543 hectares this year.
In 2008, when poppy in the Czech Republic grew on record 70,000 hectares, the field is half.
This year's poppy harvest will be richer thanks to the expansion of the surrounding areas.
It will rise against last year by 2.5 percent to 27 423 tonnes.
But the hectar yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
The Olomouc police have charged two men with attacking a knife and machete, the court has sent them into custody.
The police charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete in central Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although he tried to escape, they caused him a severe and severe injury, which required treatment in the hospital and further treatment," said police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
The two obvious perpetrators were arrested immediately after the attack by the police.
The plaintiff filed a motion for the court to take them into custody, and the court granted him a hearing on Friday.
Both men are at risk of three to ten years in prison.
The police charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in central Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The attackers caused him severe and severe injuries, the man ended up in a hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which happened on Tuesday at noon in the Freedom class, the police reported.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, informed Olomouc police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
A mass struggle between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal altercation, two attackers attacked a 35 - year - old man with a knife and machete.
Although the assaulted man tried to escape, he was injured and injured, which required hospital treatment and further treatment, the police spokesperson stated.
In a struggle that raised great attention in the city centre, and because of which several police guards and officers had to intervene on the scene, family disputes were involved.
CSIs of a 40-year-old male from Slovakia and a 37-year-old male from Olomouc accused him of attempted severe harm to his health and to his carnage.
The plaintiff filed a motion for the court to take them into custody, and the court complied with him on Friday, and the spokesperson added.
Machete was used in the center of Olomouc in a mass battle also five years ago, it happened only a few tens of meters away, before the discotheque of Varna in Riegro street.
At the time, the police reported that a group of approximately ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the company who were standing outside the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished the two attacking foreigners with suspended punishment.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around every day.
One of the loudest examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of the Senova Square.
She was supposed to be a hotel a long time ago.
But there's still nothing.
That you need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the centre of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several tenement houses, which, despite their location, size and often also the monumental protection only empty and eat with emptiness.
We have selected properties in the center using the project Emptydomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties on the territory of the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually the victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or belong to a state that does not know how to get rid of them or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless.
Whether the owners pay a special tax or not, they want an initiative

Clinton's husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to disclose his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
They spent over a million dollars on Clinton's charity.
Most of the Clintons' income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
The U.S. Democrats candidate for the Presidential Office Hillary Clinton published her tax returns on Friday, increasing the pressure on her Republican opponent Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, announced an AP agency.
Most of Clinton's income - over $6 million - is behind their speeches, mainly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that the husbands of Clinton paid a federal income tax of 34.2% last year, followed by a tax of nine percent on government and local income.
Thus, they paid 43.2 percent of their income on taxes.
Trump, however, has a problem with a similar step, so far he has not decided to publish a tax return.
There's a possibility Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all. Clinton wrote on twitter a few minutes after she released her confession.
Clinton is repeatedly returning to the secrets around Trump's income, among other things, to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is actually as rich as she claims, reported by AP.
Trump's assets are estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower profit would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful businessman.

In Nigeria, the polio broke out again.
The Boko Haram Islamists prevented a consistent vaccination and killed doctors.
There have been cases of child armor in Nigeria again.
In the northeastern part of the country, the government declared an emergency vaccination because two children infected with this disease were paralyzed.
The vaccines have taken the helicopters there.
In the affected area, Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram were active, preventing vaccination and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was unnoticed.
In the northeastern Nigeria, an extraordinary vaccination of children against armor will begin because there two children infected with this disease were paralyzed.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed in Somalia two years ago.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children and another four million children will be vaccinated in the State of Borno.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday according to AP quickly transported the vaccines against child armor to the affected northeastern part of the country where Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the virus had flown unnoticed in the area for many years.
The extremists in Boko Haram have in the past prevented vaccination and have even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible on Thursday for doctors to get to areas where children with armor were detected.
Both disabled toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for eliminating the armor Michel Zaffran station said the vaccination in Nigeria will start next week.
In Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has been active for a long time.
The area was made available to international organisations and governments only early this year when Boko Haram managed to weaken significantly in this part of the country.
The Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole admitted that the new cases of armor are a great disappointment to the country because Nigeria wanted to announce that the polio had been eradicated in it next year.
WHO pointed out that it is possible that although the disease had not appeared for two years, it still spread among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, half of all armor cases in the world appeared in Nigeria.
While the polio was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now remains in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He was listening to the stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes who escaped from the pimp gang thanks to the police.
The Pope heard their difficult life stories and called them to look with confidence into the future.
Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking by this meeting and to call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes in Rome who were liberated by the police from the power of the pimp gang.
For more than an hour, the head of the Catholic Church listened to the fallen women’s stories and then urged them to look confidently into the future, said the Vatican spokesman.
Among the former prostitutes that Francis visited, there were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were subjected to violent physical violence during forced prostitution.
He visited Francis to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for a stronger fight against him, said the pope’s spokesperson.
František often draws attention to the fate of people on the edge of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this April and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will strike at the jihadis factory.
But without the help of Muslims, we can't.
France has its own Muslims in the fight against radical Islamism.
Moreover, Prime Minister Manuel Valls’ government plans to make major changes in the functioning of the mosque and in spiritual education.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayers.
And the others will follow, announced the Home Secretary.
There are over a hundred jihadists in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who undermine public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this freedom," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only the imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop financing the mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, most of them from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
That is why preachers who can sow radicalism in France enter the mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," said the Prime Minister.
The key to meeting these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should function as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam is now operating in the country, founded by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
Even then, the Foundation was to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But soon, the institution was affected by internal contradictions and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," said Valls recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate about a new institution that will replace the non-functional foundation became a reality.
Everything hastened other terrorist attacks in France, which were carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
The French Home Secretary Bernard Cazeneuve recently heard that the new foundation would be established this October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to oversee Imams.
For now, it is not clear where he will take money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for the various educational centres.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special charge or a tax on halal food.
It would in practice be paid by the salesmen of the hallal food, for the provision of certification.
A part of this money would then travel to the foundation's money.
The contribution of EUR 10 to 20 (EUR 270 to CZK 540) could then be paid by French pilgrims who are going to Mecca.
There are about 30,000 on the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia every year.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should be present in the mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is consistent with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is in a fight against radicals.
And the others will follow, announced recently by the Minister of the Interior.
In France, there is no room for those in mosques who declare hatred and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
According to estimates, there are some 2500 mosques and prayers in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are influenced by radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have banished about 80 imam, and in several other decades they are considering it.
But not everyone thinks that the government's actions can significantly act against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This does not happen in mosques, young people radicalize on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Research Centre.
The Kelemen tracker lost in the first round of the sprint with the star Bauge.
The Czech race biker has to fight for the procedure to the eight finals in the repair rides.
The race cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after the sprint qualification procedure between the top 18 lost in the first round of the fight with the French great Gregory Bauge, a silver defender from the past games in London.
The procedure to the eight-finals must be fought in repairs.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track were built 27 riders and the best Czech railway driver today took the 14th best time.
Two flight launches made it in 9.969.
In the main elimination phase, he was thus expected to qualify as the fifth Baugé, who already has a bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
At the end, though he was touching an experienced Frenchman, he looked after the procedure.
The attorney of the gold, Jason Kenny, flashed a great performance.

The current maximum (3:51,659), which belonged to the British four years since the London Olympics, has improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Press: They Want Fresh Wind in the Sector
The representatives of young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over a new treaty.
The Board of Young Doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the whole board to support further field events at the beginning of September.
JDC says that the ministers failed to resolve the issues about the treaty.
Young doctors and medical students voted against the contract agreed with BMA in July.
58 % of its members who participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday night on Twitter, President JDC Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained "no more silent" about the questions, which is a great deal to reject the contract.
She said: "In this light, the JDC executive authority has decided by voting to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to seek new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to government silence today, the Executive Board of the JDC formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Board in order to approve the running programme of branch-specific events from the beginning of September.
This year, the dispute led a young doctor to announce six strikes, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawan, resigned after a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract that BMA recommended.
BMA members at meetings before voting before 54 000 young doctors and medical students said that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Health Minister said that the treaty would be a burden for medicine in England.
Russia and Turkey: The "incompatibilities" alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long vocabulary wars and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimír Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the luxury hall of the palace in St Petersburg, I felt that Ankara wanted more reconciliation.
There's been an injection of hands, yes.
But Putin did not smile and hardly radiated his warmth, even according to his measured standards.
On the contrary, Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "Dear Friend" Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its level before the crisis, but would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting down of the Russian combat aircraft by Turkey at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was furious at the time.
Putin was handing out wounds around him, and Ankara was accused of sticking a knife in Moscow's back.
It was even greater that she came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media has been running a massive campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly, it looked like the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious was the accusations from top government officials that Erdoga's own family benefited from illegal trade in oil in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St Petersburg the official message came that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received the apology he asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia may have declared some kind of victory.
The benefits of the announcement of the truce are clear to Ankara.
In the first place Erdogan was almost deprived of power during the failed coup last month and therefore he needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey were visibly shaken by it.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a severe impact - in particular the abolition of charter flights, which each year carry several million Russian tourists off the coast of Turkey.
This figure decreased by almost 90 %.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly relax here if there is a resumption of flights.
They make money in Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, national television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when the re-import of agricultural commodities from Turkey is authorised.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Vedemości newspaper.
However, the visit was of additional political value to Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what he considers a poor reaction to an attempt at a coup.
In addition, the long-lasting relentless talks about EU accession and Putin's accession - which is eager to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey's bonds with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after trying to counter.
You must understand that for Moscow, which is deeply rooted in the fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this pompous, coastal palace of Russia and Turkey has allowed me to demonstrate what one of the analysts described as "incompatibilities": how they join forces of two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of introductory talks, both presidents at the press conference said they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately asked the question of the differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both countries could find a common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster, when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft - it is certainly better that both leaders are at least speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be repressed into the role of a back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
She fell from them when she nearly disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from her debt.
At the time, the strategic brands used ‘RBS’ to protect other consumer finance brands.
Millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, ranging from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Winbledom Champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more excellence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but it will not start new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking that will get more into the foreground - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our journeys to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
BBC station Scotland said: “The RBS brand will cease to be our brand and brand, for which our employees work, because we are now much more a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts to focus on the home scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring of the Six Nations Championship, preparing the profile of individual sports sponsoring brands.
"It is a good time for us to move to the brand bank, because the basic question (which we ask ourselves) is how do we focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would've been very cynical if we'd said that we'd become a great bank for customers and introduced those brands.
But with our focus on customer needs, and not on our own, I think there's been a lot of changes.
We can remind them of these signs, I think it's time for the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket horse Prediction led to the goal of the 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory at Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in the UK in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone has reached its second victory in the evening on its local track - the horse Prediction, which is trained by John Gosden.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in flat races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple champion of Dettori, who had previously won the Ghayyar horse, said: "It's strange."
I'm very moved because my family is here, too.
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when, after winning, he brings Prediction
The two jockeys reached this milestone in the obstacle races - the Richard Johnson jockey champion and the 20-time pension champion Sir Anthony McCoy, which during his career breaking records led to the goal of more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, 9-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he reached a milestone reached by only a few riders before him.
It's stylish and strong, but it's just his tactical fištron that distinguishes him from the other riders in the carriage.
He is a fantastic ambassador to the race, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just ride on weekends and big races, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
Of course, the truth is that Frankie was driving a winner in the UK for much of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
It's of a living nature, which is good for British racing sport, but more importantly, it's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer jump
From the flying finishes to the flight jumps - Frankie Dettori has been the messenger of the British plane racing two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
Insurmountable numbers of big race winners, including his famous "great seven" in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and was banned from taking off due to drugs.
Three years ago, he first stagnated when he returned after a six-month ban on takeoff, but he showed incredible inner strength, and he returned in the best form to all doubters in spite of it.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released President Sergei Ivanov’s Presidential Office
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivan from the post of president of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “released Ivanova from his services the head of the Russian presidential office,” but there was no reason.
Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, will take his place.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno was previously a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (Russian) states that later he was the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of administration is to support your activities of the Head of State within the meaning of the draft laws and to check to what extent your instructions are being followed.
Putin said on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to release his post and recommended that Vajno replace him.
Can they convince smiles?
This step was completely mystified by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates for a long time and, like Putin, he worked for KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasting state television, both men declared that he was leaving the office's head office on his own request.
But only a few people convinced the smiles on the cameras - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the consequence of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once considered to be a possible president suddenly wants to pursue Russia's environmental policy has come across a lot of mistrust.
The Kremlin’s site quotes notes to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you to give me this very demanding post, even a problematic post, four years of trust.
Apparently, I've been head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, he worked for the Committee on State Security (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin joined power, he appointed Ivan’s one of his five closest associates.
It was even speculative in its time that Ivanov could become the successor of Putin in charge of the state after his second term of office, because the third period would be counter-constitutional for Putin.
But this post took over another close to Putin's associate, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister just three and a half years later before he returned to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of the criminal mind series, was released after he hit the director.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The television stations ABC and CBS that produce the series announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before he was fired.
There were creative differences in the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry this happened," he said in his statement.
According to ABC and CBS TV station statements, details of how the character of Gibson disappears from a series watching the stories of the FBI's team of agents a little later.
Fourty-year-old actor, who was famous for her main role in sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love the Thoughts of a criminal, and over the past 12 years I have given heart and soul to them," Gibson said in his statement he issued on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it until the end, but that's not gonna happen now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The return of the series to the 12th series is expected on September 28th.
In the city of Banff mysteriously landed fish in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sand eels left behind by water.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a short film of his finding on the Periscope canal in the belief that someone could help him to explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern platform and the Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
It is the first of the four closures between the “ploughers” that are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the Fife bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building Queensferra Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnessing the impressive use of more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel in the construction of this part of the bridge by construction engineers.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation requiring extraordinary precision.
In its place now there is a total of 79% of the total area of the bridge, the concrete for the last parts of the platform is now cast in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Designers project, said: “The first closure in the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the tip of ground construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expanding platform of the North Tower, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern proximity viaduct 700 millimetres southward.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and it has to be dragged up about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “Happy to be alive”
Three men are "happy to be alive" after being flushed off their fishing boat at Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue ship station issued an alert on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued uncircumcised.
"We saw their boat circling in their vicinity and thought of the worst," said the manager of the Moelfre Vince Jones rescue boat.
"A strong wind will, fortunately, lead him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men saved a local fishing boat, the third man, aged 60, was found without a life jacket exhausted as to how to hold a fight.
They've all been beamed aboard a coastal lifeboat, and we'll take them back to the rescue ship station.
Jones said: “Three men being thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The engine of the ship had a rope for an emergency shut-off, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when there was a coup.
Someone up above those boys was holding a protective hand.
The judge refuses to solve the case for the Fatty wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three Members who, according to the prosecution, were to receive a lucrative post for a political concession from Prime Minister Nečas and his head of the cabinet of Jana Nagyová.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
The scavenger, the Fuksa and the Muffer made it possible by their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential posts in state-owned companies.
Therefore, they also faced suspicions of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, almost CZK 2 million of compensation was incurred.
The deafard is now speaking as a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works at the Fruit Market Court Building and solves civil disputes.
Yet Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious (resolving criminal matters - note red) and to avoid any objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another district of Prague.
The king has already released Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagy, twice.
It was an alleged abuse of military intelligence to follow the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas Radka.
In this case, the wholesaler didn't work.
According to a lawyer, Jaroslav Ortman, this is a needlessly overreaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in such a way as to exclude a court if the Witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid it wouldn't be possible to judge anything at all, he wrote for the diary.
"I find it a little drowsy," he said.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also accused in the case of political hits.
According to his attorney, Petr Toman, however, any objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 discussed the prosecution of former cabinet chief of Prime Minister Petr Nečas Jana Nagyová (today Nečasová) and others accused in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Nečasová and her husband are coming to court.
Fatty was supposed to deal with the statements about Perutek.
The emissary's wife, for example, was to judge President Miloš Zeman's statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutk.
Zeman said he was sympathizing with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid of allied forces.
She flew to Syria with her two identical friends last February from Gatwick Airport in London.
The British Ministry of the Interior did not comment on her death.
According to the police, the young Londoners who fled home were secretly transferred to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana headed to the media for their other former classmate at the Bethhnal Green Academy in London.
Last year, the case has triggered a huge wave of attention and tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria so far, some 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined the radicals of IS and other groups.
Those who come home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for a hundred grand salary.
A great paid job that you don't even need college for.
That's how it looks at first sight for a computer job.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only on Czech conditions extremely high salary (in Prague you will earn up to 180 000 CZK), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
The most sought-after are, according to statistics of Grafton personnel programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Thus, it is not up to the candidates for a job position, but the job positions for candidates, commented Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
College education is not a necessity for IT professionals.
College education is a good basis and is an overall indicator of the intelligence and education of the candidate, but it often does not have much to do with knowledge of development.
Developers have to keep learning new things, which will not be replaced by one, says Petr Kubačka, Director of Monster Career CZ.
The most to be earned in Prague.
I.T. Wages everywhere move high above the Republic's average.
They come to the most money in Prague and Brno, it is no longer a hit parade in the regions.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," says Kubačka.
The highest profit will be made by the technical directors.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it will not fall below CZK 80,000.
Demanded are also IT project managers.
They can make CZK 60,000 - 100 000 when they enter.
The fight is about graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the office of employment, it does not apply to I.T.s.
If companies are overpaid and overpaid by an expert from another company, they are happy to reach for a graduate.
Because they can raise him according to their own.
You can't do without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but it is necessary to have a decent English at least.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is necessary in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet a number of cases where companies are looking for, in particular, an educated and experienced person and will be satisfied only with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a supporter has more foreign language, he is interesting to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, says Director Kubačka.
Yeah, Google, there's paradise.
Only Czech workers can be silently envied by Google employees.
Of course, flexible working hours, work opportunities from home or various reduced hours, not just for moms.
"The company provides new dads four weeks of extra leave after the birth of the child," says Martina Joneková, Google spokesperson.
Hyccuping also includes health care for employees and family, catering, transport, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Anyone who wants to learn has a green light and no matter what new to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such a full free fridge is definitely not to be thrown away either.
A healthy lunch (in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microkitchens in every office where people always find a healthy snack, the speaker reveals.
And in order for nothing to be thrown away, what they don't eat, they put in boxes that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these on Czech conditions of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shift or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the spokesperson adds.
The UN has severely criticised Bulgaria for the criminalisation of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees on Thursday.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian Government "is causing serious concern that Bulgaria does not comply with international law", warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in the statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly worrying to be a witness to the importance and influence of public figures expressing their public support for criminal armed struggles, which are duly organised by refugees at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross the Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested in an irregular way," said Zeid.
And even worse - often being prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has detained 14,000 migrants this year, for the same period of 21,000 last year.
Pokémon Go - a search for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
A number of people over the last decade have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of their screens.
Pokémon Go picks people up from the sofas and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens originally sprung on TV, later on video games, and most recently on smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and activities outside are not excluded.
Of course, I am talking about a fashion that is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more was created).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was also a decline in interest before the introduction of this new game at the beginning of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
The introduction in other countries was postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go gained more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as he has Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smart phone go out looking for Pokémons that follow through GPS, and when they find them, they can “photo” (via the screenshot on the phone) or “catch”.
Mania has taken over the generation that played the game at a younger age, picked her up from the seats and drove her out looking for Pokemons.
Thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that a “average” person will take every day.
The Cardiogram app for smart watches from Applu, which watches 35,000 users, recently reported to Washington Post that within two days of starting the game, the number of people who have been watching each day has jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokémon Go plays - only sees rough data about levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns seeking to “find 30,”“ get off the couch, ” and “have been active every day, ” fell on barren soil, because most public - health messages are boring and addressed to people who do not look good.
However, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity contributes to weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can't put all of here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight.
Some even get new friends in pursuit of the pokémons.
Of course, there are boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone can walk in the door.
And what, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
At the time, smart phone apps, like Fitbit, could track our activity, but they didn't give us any reason to do anything like this.
The novel is looking and the interest in it will start to drop at some point.
However, thanks to Pokémon's success, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help many people to pursue activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles won gold in a women's gymnastics multi-fight
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No effort on the hammer.
They were all mute at the simple.
Excellent at everything.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast followed the title in a multi-fight and the others overcame the full line under the Olympic headlights.
The overall result 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead in front of a silver medalist and a member of Aly Raisman's "final five" team and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a show on the hammer in the finals of multi-fighting individuals in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win a multi-fight, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnasts of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final evaluation on the board and her long journey to this point ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks it into the same league of unique athletes of their time, such as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, won 15 medals at world championships - including 10 gold medals. Her stunning ensembles are a mixture of ambition and accuracy and the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The final test was in Brazil, not even between Biles and the rest of the competitors, but between her and the burden of too much expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be perceived as disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), to the left, and Aly Raisman is hugged after the victory of the gold and silver medal in the female multi-ball finals of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
First Biles won Tuesday, when she was a exclamation point in the celebration of Martha Karolyi's leaving national team coordinator.
Biles insists that during her long journey to the top, she never looked forward, which is not entirely true.
Part of her composition in simple - the one that contains for her a typical triple flip-flop flip-flop - is set in Latin music that could just use a home to the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman on the way to the gym where Boorman trained and got stronger.
The multi-fighting competition has not been lost since the summer of 2013 - this is a sequence of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took over for a short lead with two turns, it was just an illusion.
The floor and the simple - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back into the lead with 15,433 points per hammer - and finished with 15,933 points in the straight.
Raisman gently hugged her while waiting for the final score - mere formality - and around the shimmering red, white and blue shadows, the Bileses appeared tears when they fulfilled a wish that she once wrote in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared a third place with Mustafin, but that's when the bronze was eating her for the sum of the top three.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old team captain, who Americans call "the grandmother," was a lot ahead.
After her simple ones, she sent a crowd of air kisses, overcome by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, she has a post that this 19-year-old athlete placed on Twitter this week, where she became a total hit, a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women died and a girl of 12 years of age during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix, were shot while they were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities reported Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis Maleah's daughter were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked on the driveway.
The report states that an armed man stood on the side of a passenger and fired eight shots from a handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, it's not worth the triple-murder robbery because the attacker didn't take his wallet or the $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
Police spokesperson in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the investigators were finding out if the shooting had anything to do with any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Hispanic districts, nine attacks occurred within four months, killing seven people and two others were injured.
"This is happening in the residential area outside the houses", Howard previously introduced this month for the KPHO branch of CBS Station.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including the brown Nissan from the late 1990s, the black BMW from the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks are related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to a hospital where she later suffered her injury.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on the scene.
A Witness told the police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities have also published a police report on the shooting, the target of which was an empty van just half an hour before the murder three times, and the police believe that this serial killer was the cause.
The investigators found the casings and assembled a bullet from the residue of the bullets in the seat and from under the hood of the engine.
The mother of a six-year-old with micro-cephalia: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves to sing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from micro-cephalia, which is a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
The first time he came home, I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - it is clear that you are ready for this," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund may never know them and may not even survive.
Some doctors have even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people weren't doing this anymore," explains Picciut.
Edmund's walking with the help of a walker.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't sit down and crawl, and he still hasn't spoken.
But some of the milestones are already slowly being filled.
He comes with help and rides a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth is showing a sign language by which Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," said Picciut for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different states: genetics, such as Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
The symptoms and the prognosis can vary significantly.
It's too soon to tell us what the Zika virus will do to the lives of the infected.
Picciut reminds me of an emotional tax she's collecting from an uncertain future.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And he's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the total forecast was, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
However, Picciut has an encouraging message for the mothers of all children who suffer from congenital defects caused by Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Strong rain and heavy floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, and on Saturday, more rains are expected.
The National Meteorology Service (NWS) reported that after extreme spillages, a number of rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the southern Mississippi will spill out of their shores and face extensive floods.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that civil servants are constantly in contact with local authorities and aid is already on the way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesperson of the governor's office for national security and preparedness for the crisis said they were getting applications for a water-driving vehicle, boats and sandbags.
Steele said only Tangipaho's precinct asked for ten thousand sandbags.
Flood patrols will stay in most southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service in the declaration stated that it could rain another 8 to 13 centimetres over the sea.
In southern Alabama, flood patrol was on standby on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
According to the forecast, the Comite rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are to climax on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both of them could flood a number of houses in the suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that the floods of the Ascension district are a danger, when these distributed flows will only be cast slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, slightly south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached local time on Friday at 9 a.m. at the highest recorded level.
Paramedics are still picking up people from the tidal waters in the counties of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were already among the saved at Gloster's on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said his next stepson, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up and the water was coming," said Hansford.
I had it till my passport.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever seen on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all the members of his family are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that crisis workers saved all three huge trucks in military style and transferred them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of heavy rains, floods “quickly spread ” and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that from midnight to Friday to morning, 35 centimeters of rainfall fell.
Krautmann said the soil is heavily soaked from the center.
The authorities stated that heavy rain and paid trips required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and the abolition of teaching in five school districts.
The branch of WWL station CBS announced that 200 homes were flooded according to the old man of Tangipahoa.
Residents were evacuated into two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller reported that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that had imprisoned the high water.
There were shelters set up in the municipality of Amite and Hammond for those evacuated.
"They'll be able to come home when the water starts falling," he said.
More than 20 streets were closed because of the flooding site in Tangipahoa, and local residents were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"The last great floods were here in March," said Lacy Landrum city manager.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, the crisis manager at Harrison County, Mississippi, said there was a persistent rain on the Gulf Coast.
He said that a couple of houses were reported flooding on Thursday, but none of them showed up in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "Boy shot to death", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, six-year-olds were shot in Philadelphia.
His grandparents identified him as Mahai Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
My grandparents say that the boy suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including weaknesses, legs, arms and abdomen, but was conscious when transported to the hospital.
"He took too much, his little body was shot to death," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez, the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family for the station said the boy should get better.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men aged 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two more victims are in stable condition.
According to the station report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old male in critical condition.
Two more victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia reported that there was probably a gunfire between several armed men.
On the scene were found casings of attack weapon type belonging to various assault weapons.
Apparently, it was definitely about a continuing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
So it seems that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," Anthony Ginaldi, a police officer in Philadelphia, said to the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No one's been arrested, and the police are reportedly investigating surveillance footage.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray bullet on Tuesday in front of a house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I picture a women's gymnasium team for this year's Olympic Games, for a number of reasons.
First of all, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raismanová, who is of Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also strengthened the presence of blacks and Latin Americans at the tip of this sport.
Number one gymnast in the past four years was African-American.
Simone and Gabby were in the first and second places last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became a champion of the Olympics, and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of the three-time world winner Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who showed unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in a female multi-fighting individual.
And a member of the Aly Raisman team got silver.
We're witnessing a sporting peak, but in gymnastics class in the country, it doesn't look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie took the same route as Aly and Madison on the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the team of gymnasts at the next Olympic Games will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which maintain parents who pay for training costs, equipment, travels, uniforms, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for trainers and their trusts and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all trainings and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained athlete athlete when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring trainings of gymnastics that are more accessible and accessible to communities of many young girls that have inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gym Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly black and Hispanic) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of mind.
This combination means life benefits for good health, successes at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing "girl strength" and winning the Olympic team gold, and thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origin to go on the road to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter the next strike.
The ministers hoped that the British Medical Association (BMA) would conclude their disagreements with the conclusion of a revised contract, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the election rejected the agreement.
Hunt in July revealed plans to enforce the contract with NHS being in "no one's country" and further delays would have a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend working procedures with a view to improving care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Committee for Young Doctors, said in her statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labour crisis and, therefore, fair treatment of all doctors.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors enters the new agreement, progress must be made and time must be made.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation were faced with the willingness to involve Dr. and often with deafening silence by the government.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, this possibility is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for coercion and solve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, then young doctors are prepared to take further steps.
During the last strike, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed at the end of April, as nurses and specialists were called to represent the doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that the British Medical Association (BMA) would conclude disagreements regarding the changes after the conclusion of the revised contract.
BMA wants higher payments for the weekend for 54 000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, president of NHS employers, called on young doctors not to enter any strike.
Mortimer said: “The field action will achieve little or nothing, but there will be pressure on already overloaded teams and services, and there will be increased concern, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families. ”
In the past two months, we have been dealing with the advice of young doctors and together with the Ministry of Health and Others we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informer.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as fatigue, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after career interruptions, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and gender pay gap - was evidence of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A cure for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a medicine that costs about 60 crowns (two pounds).
Ticagrelor’s medicine for blood clotting reduces the risk of having a seizure again in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now given for a period of 12 months after having had a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizures.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to humans for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But NHS watchdog NICE now recommends that it be given to humans for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack or stroke every year, and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat that forms a continuous layer on the artery walls.
If this layer is severed, blood clots, blood access to the heart, and heart attack may occur.
If the clot relaxes, it can continue through the bloodstream, block the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk for another seizure.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by creating clots less likely.
It is recommended that patients receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, the director of the MICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of effective secondary prevention, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
It is a pleasure for us to be able to expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will benefit from Ticagrelor in advance.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the risk of bleeding - is limited beyond three years, it is not recommended in the proposal for treatment beyond this period.
With computer culture, fraud in Muslim regions began to flourish
The mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was called off last year for corruption, which was linked to a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the neglect of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, as stated today in the government report.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises the police, election inspectors and city hall for ignoring the abuse of voters because of "sensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption measures, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should do cordons from the election rooms and protect the guarded voters.
He recommended that voters take an ID card with them and be able to prove who they are during the elections.
At present, the voters need to state their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to put indelible ink on the fingers of people when they cast their votes in order to prevent a person from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It calls for greater access to documents from meetings and decisions taken by non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only about protecting against electoral fraud, it is also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and the financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report has been requested by Downing Street as a consequence of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets, West London.
Last year, the special electoral court decided that the mayor-in-Office of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his post after the allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically affected" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and had silenced his criticisms by accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
In his words, Rahman “led his campaign so that it was a religious duty of dedicated Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes have been questioned, or as a result of identity theft, when a person is voting and issuing himself to someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern at the fraud in the correspondence vote - which is claimed to have put pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose during the Muslim community.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on how to clear the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
His report states: “The proof that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were subjected to pressure to vote in accordance with the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh. ”
"The concerns were that... state institutions had closed their eyes to such behavior because of "politically correct" sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric has made 50 recommendations on how to clear the system, including the prohibition of political activists from manipulating correspondence votes and thus preventing "voice extraction."
The report now evaluated by Theresa May also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and tax fraud.
Consider asking the voters to present an ID before the vote.
Use of indelible ink on the fingers of people in the vote to prevent a person from voting twice.
Perform systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence vote shall be limited to three years.
To ban political agitators and activists from manipulating their correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create a cordon around the election rooms.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute persons who exert illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Ban the taking of photographs in the electoral rooms.
To require that only the English (except for Wales) work in the electoral rooms.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to the electoral booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it's "surprising" that after the Tower Hamlets case, no criminal charges were filed.
"The election court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the power of evidence of a crime.
It also criticises the resultless "checking boxes" in the voters' registration departments at the city hall.
Sir Eric said: “The decision of the court in the Tower Hamlets case last year was awakening.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threatens this reputation.
Madness of the cycling double duke Kate and other doppelgangers of famous personalities at the Olympics in Rio
This week, fans of the Riu 2016 Olympic Games went mad with the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is quite similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a twenty-four-year-old Olympic girl is far from the only athlete seeking gold this year, who can boast of his own doppelganger among famous personalities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous personalities that are currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL Women's Column has compiled a list of Olympics that are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted game: A member of the American archer team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared since childhood to Leonard DiCaprio
In addition to Kate's double on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be a twin star Leonard DiCaprio.
A racer from a team of American archers, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures appeared, which markedly resembled a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed media madness and admitted that he had heard of his similarity with Leo since he was a kid.
"He sees no great resemblance himself, except for beards," Brady said for Huffington Post.
"He's a loser and he looks good, so I think he's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: a striking resemblance between the British jumper Greg Rutherford and the favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafin, with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And if we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan is an "athletic version" of the actor from the film The Beginning (Inception)
Another long comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov is proud not only of the same skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord, and Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team says he looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Powerful women: Hope Solo (left) and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape of faces and eyes
Not only one: The Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed similarities
On waves theory: According to this user there may be a reason for a similar view of pairs
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction at the fact that “the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are truly identical.”
The football star Hope Sol and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar shape to the face and eyes.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medal holder for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her wonderfully wide smile, which is like copying Gabrielle Union's smile, stars Bravo, girls!
The commentator of the CBC Olympic Games apologizes for saying about the Chinese swimmer that she “exploded”
A 14-year-old Ai Yanhan commented on by Byron MacDonald from the Olympic Games to the CBC station. The swimming pool ended in the fourth place of the women's race on the 4x200 m relay free-style
The Canadian station CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “touched like a smell” and “breathed” during the race.
Byron MacDonald's commentator thought his microphone was off when, at the end of the 4x200 metre women's relay finals, he started to spout his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring a "revival" to the CBC commentator team, said, "The 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Too much excitement, it was like a smell, it exploded.
Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second relay at 1:57.79 - that is 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to reach China.
The viewers in Canada began to speak quickly online and were appalled by the tone and language that the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane on Twitter wrote: “Did the proclaimer at CBC declare that a 14 - year - old swimmer from China “breathed up"??????
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China in the 4x200-metre freestyle women's relay race was described as: "The 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's critique on Twitter came from all sides, and many asked for his appeal
When Twitter users found out how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon afterward, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for the live commentary of MacDonald and said: "We apologize for the commentary on the performance of the swimmer who escaped to the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC Station finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment
Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and added their apology to the reply for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the comments of the commentator MacDonald
The station also quickly apologized and made a statement public.
Honestly, she's sorry that the words were spoken, she shouldn't have gotten on the air.
We quickly apologized to our TV audiences and those watching us on social media.
For the record, Byron's comments concerned the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer himself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live air and tried to explain his comment by saying that he didn't want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the broadcast from the Olympics to CBC.
"I meant the performance of a swimmer and not the person of a swimmer as such."
"There's no need to say that I didn't mean any disrespect, and I'm very sorry."
Customers in the first place were offended by a woman who was shamelessly trying her underwear in the middle of the store.
When a woman undressed to test her panties in the middle of the sales area, the buyers were not sure which way to look.
To make it worse, she tried to see her size fall, took off her panties and put them back in the shelf.
She continued to watch and finally tried four pairs of pants at Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flofestone.
Shop at Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on her panties before returning them to the shelf
Jenny Davidson's mother, who was at the store at the time, stated that a mysterious woman had “redressed and left the store without buying anything after trying her underwear. ”
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She was standing in the middle of the store, taking her panties off the shelf, undressing her own pantyhose and panties and wearing them.
"She didn't even try to find a place of discretion - just standing there, brazen like a monkey."
"Everyone was just staring at the way she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back in the shelf."
She did the same thing with three other people before she finally decided she didn't like anything, got dressed again and left.
"It seemed like she didn't mind at all who was watching - even if she thought of the person who might buy the panties she tried."
Miss Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea that someone would take home the panties that someone else was wearing and no one would clean them up. That’s disgusting.”
The event happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I was collecting things that she apparently tried to get me to take them off the market - which is also the only thing that was right. ”
"I would be terrified to bring home new panties and find out that they were worn by another woman, undressed, and that they were not washed."
The spokesman of the store Primark said: “Primark knows about the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to fight the attack of weapons using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this Dailymail.com video, it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation based in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly get ahead of a rapist, whether he comes near you from the front or from the back.
If they come near you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your assailant and "have a loose missile path".
Then you will grasp the gun between your forearm and your shoulder just before you strike him in the face with your free elbow.
Then the knee follows the weakness, and while the attacker is writhing in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit the main one in the face and start retreating, while holding the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab a gun and twist it so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time put your strength into the weapon and strike the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from its grip and start retreating, while still pointing at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of the robbery - if you are not a Grand Master Krav Maga - is to issue all the cash.
Traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
The British traveler has decided to test his immune system and gullible reflexes by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and travel author Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, to prove the strength of his immune system he licked with his tongue a euro banknote, railing to Piccadilly Circus, a toilet washbutton on the train and a Russian public telephone.
Before licking each item, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he's getting into.
The experiment, on the basis of which Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on the train that used thousands of other people may seem totally repulsive, but for example, there are more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Ian Wright has been talking to doctors and health professionals throughout his journey across Europe about strengthening intestinal flora and his own health.
Fortunately, none of what he licked left anything worse than the taste in his mouth.
Ian Wright was famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on the way around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
During this mission, he completely safely tested his immune system - from the public rails at the train stations to the flush
In a film he made about it, he says: “I haven’t cared much about my health since I was a child, and I’ve put everything in my mouth, from dirt to worm eating and mud water. ”
He definitely confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but refused to lick after his luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio filmed the traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom
He said in the film, "This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
Nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in cooperation with the Finnish producer of Valio milk products.
Mr. Wright has provided Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acids and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen the intestinal bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for refreshments, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow our involvement and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in broader contexts - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon, and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's say this, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of what I asked him to - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, while others were pretty hard.
I'm glad we made some of the dirty stuff licks."
In 2015, Valio conducted a survey whereby 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria primarily to stomach and intestine health and 58% reported that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
The family of socially needed before evictions destroyed the city building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of socially needed people left a damage of £50,000 in their community house after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their violent eviction from the house, the housing cooperative officials were shocked to find the property in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, garbage rolled all over the floor, and the walls were tainted.
The family has already moved out and is believed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, head of housing issues at Cornwall House said she was worried about saving the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, since this property probably goes into the consciousness of "not that pretty part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple have three sons who sometimes lived in the house, and the police said that the terror that the family had caused belonged to street fights using baseball bats, intimidating the outsiders, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screaming, fights and abuses.
Skeldon (47), whose name was given on the lease agreement, was sentenced in June for antisocial behaviour.
In several rooms in a house that may be demolished, smelly garbage was found.
In a house where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was ripped out.
The neighbors say they've seen them on the street fighting, and people call the police regularly.
Cornwall House moved her and her partner out of the house this week after they received an additional deadline of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The neighbors who were relieved welcomed the eviction that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said: “They didn’t care about anyone at all. ”
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, there's no counting at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the oversight manager at Cornwall House's neighborhood, said the family couldn't work with local authorities.
Family lived in the house for 20 years, police were regularly called to the house
Garbage and old toys were laying in an overgrown part of the village house.
She adds: “It is a shame that the tenant has not been able to accept responsibility for her own behavior and for her family’s behavior. Eviction is always the last step considered by Cornwall House.
There was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions according to a witness had to be horrified by her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community who have informed us bravely.
I hope that this move will bring some comfort to the neighbors, and at the same time it will bring with it the message that we will not tolerate non-social behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenant who lived in the house at different times were around 20 years old.
Pollutant mattresses that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after eviction
The workers will now have to remove the piles of trash that remain dumped around the house.
In 2014 she made shelves in the house of raids and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and 1 700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was based on a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner now live in private accommodation in Plymouth after eviction.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
The police say they're going to try to evict tenants who are violating the rules of their lease contracts.
Angela Crow of the Den and Cornwall Police reported that eviction was a message sent to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave impunity, and to those who want to follow such behavior," she said.
The police of Den and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and non-social behavior and will continue to cooperate with partners in protecting our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after a low flight of military jet aircraft over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sunlight in Aveir, Portugal, were scared to death
The plane of the Portuguese military air force P-3C Orion flew through incredibly low
Military Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted that there was no safety risk
At a time when a low-flying jet could stand over a crowded beach, the scared tourists were panicking.
The dramatic footage shows how a military plane reaches almost a touch of the sun on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after they were disturbed by the noise of jet engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
An incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationers who posted a video of a dramatic flight over the social networks, said: “The plane flew twice as low and at one point it seemed to collapse.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed, and I really thought my plane would fall on my head. ”
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a plane flying low appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese military air force today declared that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify the fishing vessel off the coast and had to endure low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft reportedly flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires, but the air force insists that the safety of people was not compromised.
This summer, forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal and required four victims on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military air force today declared that the pilot had to fly low because of the thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessel as part of the training.
Half the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection (ČOI) found this out during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services do not usually inform the deceased of their prices or issue written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The Czech Republic has imposed 41 fines in the total value of CZK 73,000 for this.
Her spokesperson, Jiří Fröhlich, informed about this today.
Inspectors found a mistake at 47 out of 95 checks.
In addition to non-information about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly marked and once the seller used an officially uncertified gauge.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This concerned urn packaging, candle covers and vases which were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Since there is still a breach of the law in this specific field of services, the audit action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned about her death in Syrian Austria a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian air attack in Rakka, which is the bastion of a group in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"Man wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - like a message and a warning to others, that these are the real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone - is to discourage people from ever making decisions," Akunjea said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the eastern part of London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
Sultan's family learned that she married an IS fighter in Syria and widowed in a few months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, she'll leave Garland as the Supreme Court candidate.
The Senate leader for the Democratic Party, Harry Reid, says she believes that the candidate for the presidential elections for the Democrats Hillary Clinton is nominating Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
The Republicans blocked Garland's appointment in the Senate, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The head of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnel, says that the person who replaces the late judge of the Supreme Court will elect the future president.
Reid said during a conference call on Thursday that she believed Clinton would select Garland “with a certain degree of credibility.”
Reid's spokesperson later stated that he did not directly talk to Clinton about whether he would nominate Garland and just speculate.
He appreciated Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "throw the ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chairman of a federal appeal court in Washington.
Reid said that Republicans blocking Garland's appointment were "deputies" and "jumps" of a Republican candidate for the presidential office of Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't good for office.
According to the Treatments magazine, naked calendars are for "women and men"
The Treatments magazine works closely with photographer David Bellemer to issue a 2017 calendar inspired by the 70s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of exposed known personalities, NU Muses is trying to find another generation of top models for their 2017 calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his naked magazine is different from Playboy from the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Apparently, he believes the calendar too.
"We must return to displaying timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photos of the female body," said Shaw in his press release statement.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is the vinyl headed: who actually buys turntables?
Vinyl loves lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to fill in the comment section with pepperous notes under the pseudonym NoAllLone MenIn the Middle Ages, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so much discussed resurrection of turntables is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to love the originality of the physical possession, but with the nostalgic middle-aged.
Those who have recently bought the album on vinyl are most likely people between 45 and 54 years old.
Young people aged 18-24 are least likely.
It's not really about the accumulation of an enthusiastic fan - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: the older people who buy turntables are more likely to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy themselves (69% versus 66%).
But the results of YouGov are true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television newscast, I would be followed by a camera going out into a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decal gray suit and widely gesculate. Then I would stop, pull out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's see it."
Let's take a look.
While Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent vendors, there are now hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, confidences and office supplies - several fantastic specialist record stores remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while.
Stuart (55), a native from Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (counts: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counts: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London afternoon and is looking through shops to fill a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got about three or four thousand tapes.
All those recordings lined up the walls of his living room - in the picture above (the photo sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy turntables that he couldn't afford when they came out originally, and he re-buys what he sold in his youth and he didn't even have the wind.
“It’s very good of what I buy from the late 1960’s and early 1970’s. It’s things that would have been published when I was 11 or 12. I was too small then and I couldn’t get them,” he says.
They agree that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves, adding: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
This is my sin.
Take it (25) works at Sister Ray and also think that a number of customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people influenced by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old turntables back.
According to my interviews, people were most often getting rid of their collections between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their turntables and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their turntables back," he says.
This could explain the boom of lovers of turntable records of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of turntables?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a shop like Phonica that you can find a pleasant association of people with similar thinking in music stores.
According to Vez, some older customers are particularly offended by the system of non-contact payments.
Some supporters of turntables may feel engulfed in the digital world and have decided for the familiar environment of turntable packaging, things that cause memories of peaceful growing up.
"I think that filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort," says Vez.
I'm a collector myself, and that's the case with me, and I think so with a lot of people.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
"We are all their social workers!" says a coworker from a pile of turntables.
ICM’s April survey revealed that almost 50 % of people who had bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of the questioned turntables never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables do not have a turntable.
At this point in the report, he probably seemed seriously concerned about going through a pile of compilation boss nova.
The aspect of "trophyses" and recovery of interest is something Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently came in and said, "I don't have a turntable yet, but I want to buy a radiohead so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
The percentage of these is not large, but it happens.
It's more a product page than music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a phony."
These are younger people, not the older ones, the grown-up teenagers getting into it.
Fopp, where at present almost one floor is reserved for turntables, has many more visitors at my arrival.
There's a couple of '70s, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the stores before - the speakers instead of the towed jazz responds to the latest pop by Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see various customers.
None of them seem particularly alone, but intrusive mental trauma is hard to estimate when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) is a few minutes’ walk in Fopp and looks at different turntables in the discount.
She's one of those people who's looking at the window rather than the heat.
According to her words, she doesn't make much money, so she doesn't seem to be collecting turntables.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the turntables have their magic," she'll sigh.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that allegedly inspired the new generation of turntable lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I look like I'm very interested in girls in tight jeans and I'm watching a group of teenage girls who are just gathering around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's turntable.
On the left is a staircase whose wall covers the turntables of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classic music, the basis of any average collection of turntables.
No one is looking at them - maybe because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's a pure "vinyl trick."
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send several customers into Soho's depths for others, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where it is most spent on the most luxurious goods that vinyl certainly is.
But while my findings suggest that the results of YouGov are accurate - at least in turntables, they do not take into account a large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who actually exist, in turntables and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
I'm sure he doesn't spend Thursday morning wandering around record-player stores on Berwick Street, going through tapes and avoiding looking at a strange, 30-year-old fake TV host hiding behind his back, unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video report
According to scientists, Greenland’s shark has the longest average life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures 5 metres
The French court refused to break down trades in the jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the authorities' order in Salaam to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
During the court hearing this week, the Qaeda authorities argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 provisional shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cuts, sell tea at temporary restaurants for 50 cents or basic dishes for several euros.
The prefect's office in Qaeda argued that the sites need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations in court have stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups do not provide food for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Contradictive temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille Court held that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 provisional transactions, but stated that the objections of the prefect Salaam were “fully understandable”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much greater role than merely serving food to people who "live under extremely desperate conditions."
He said the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition was the cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which is operated by a non-profit organization, offering daily 200 meals, English and French hours, and asylum advice for hundreds of threatened minors without accompaniment in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition for the protection of the “baby” cafe.
The Guardian received a letter saying that closing the cafe would “be a disaster for these children, some of which are only eight years old. ”
The Charity Organization of Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after a steep increase in arrivals increased to more than 9000 during the summer - which is the most so far ever.
He thought he was dead.
The Volleyballs are bringing themselves back to life.
"Since March, I have been able to train normally," he reported to the start of the summer preparations in full force.
What happened to you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, then because of heart problems.
Because when I was at the university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt. No one found me anything.
Then the clot came up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, and it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when it's working or changing the weather.
But nothing that limits me, more like an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
I did.
Last year, I didn't know I had an embolism at a summer tournament in Wooden, and I couldn't move there at all.
I threw up blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, and I've been completely finished for five days.
I really thought I was dead, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I had to live through it, and now it's just gonna go up.
I know I've got some blood issues, that I have to watch myself more when I'm going somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Only when I wanted to go back to the preparation of the Pribram last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I've been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I knock, physically I'm better at it than I was before.
What do you expect from Ustí?
I'm looking forward to it, the gang looks good, I know most guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
I hope we can sit down humanly, make it work for us.
Can you lift the mouth?
She had a reputation for beating, but every season is different.
Brno was the eighth year ago, now it's the second.
There's a new team in Ústí, only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extralise, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
Once we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see after the first round who's gonna break in, we won't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already been experienced, and he's been through a lot, and he's gonna think about better than last place.
But my coming here wasn't his thing, I made a deal earlier.
There were other trainers in the game, and I'm a big friend with one, and it was agreed to work here.
I'm not gonna say the name.
In the end, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been coaching for decades, he's a good former player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to hang out, and I like to get an opportunity on a not-so-high team.
I've been in the Pribram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being on the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned to a stranger in Ústí, she's already coaching Australian Boehm.
What's he look like?
I happen to know him, we played in a group at the university.
And we've had a few conversations, sometimes we've been sitting together after the games, so we know each other in a friendly way.
We beat them three to one, immediately at the start of the summer preparations in Ústí, I soaked it up.
My Slovak girlfriend, she's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze are still coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with an American, he looks like a nice guy, Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea to me.
I'm the recorder, the one who creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I just found out what kind of player he was, I found out on the Internet, he's playing, I've seen some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the boy jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few texts on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, fits in with us.
How are you looking forward to being a record player?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only gonna be twenty-four, and I don't have the character to take turns.
I'd rather be in the middle of this, I'd rather be in the middle of this than be led by someone else.
I don't think I'd want to play anymore if I were to be like a second-hand recording player and take it full time.
How many times have you been number one?
Half a year in the Pribram, when it didn't work out for Kust as a captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems, and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, whose bred I was, I alternated one and two.
An excellent year was in the Old Town, after which I had many offers and chose Příbram.
That's where Budejovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
Short positioning remains Phelps' domain.
"Being back on the stage winners and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," he laughed Phelps while having his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and his mother rejoiced again in the auditorium, the son of Boomer this time quietly slept with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started swimming in a race, and in a few hours it'll be over, he told the impression.
In the finals for Phelps almost two seconds behind the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long position.
Bronz won the Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championship.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (further) Michael Phelps is the third athlete who mastered the same discipline in four games in a row.
For most of the race, Phelps was led by another American Ryan Lochte and domestic Thiago Perreira.
While the gold defense attorney in the final piece of gold in the Creature 50s put himself in a crushing finish, they fell outside the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the ceremony of the positioning, he advanced to the finale of the plant for 100 meters of butterflies.
The legend could not even be overshadowed by the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the signist double - after a hundred won in Rio and twice the line.
In the final, he left 37 hundred Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin behind, and the third ended Rus Evgeni Rylov.
While Murphy has only a fifth place in the 200th last year's World Cup, he became a signist king in Rio.
From the imaginary throne, Larkin, to whom the same double was made at the World Championship last year.
But he won a medal at the Olympics only now.
The Canadian Penny Oleksiak and the American Simone Manuel shared the gold in the stamina.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel's second silver from the relay.
Swimming gold won at OH as the first African-American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sport becomes love for them, and they get to where I am, said moved Manuel.
The third was the Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100 metre butterfly race in Rio's world record and still has the silver of the street's 200.
Until the sixth time, the world record holder, Australia's Cate Campbell.
The dwarves won the Japanese Rie Kanet, for which it was the first Olympic medal in 27 years.
It has no precious metal or from the world championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia by Julia Jefimovová, who, despite the doping past, is struggling with the incestuousness of viewers and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should still answer these questions.
I'm so tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
The right to take off in Rio has made use of the CAS sport arbitration panel just before the game began.
They were looking into my appeal, and I won.
If anyone likes it or doesn't like it, or if she has any other opinion, whether she's turning to arbitration court, she added.
Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs have had a strange day.
Just less than an hour before the game, they found out who they were going to step on.
They must have handled tactical preparation rapidly.
And then, in an unconventional time, the game on little court number one began.
The first set did not start well, then the opponents reached the lead, but in the state of 19:19 they failed the ending.
In the second they were clearly better and even, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
Above all, a number of broken services meant losing 10:15 and saying goodbye to the Olympic tournament.
"We could defeat the Russians," Hermann regretted.
How would you rate the game?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start, we got into the game.
At the end of my last balloon, I missed the income I used to get used to.
We lost the set, which was the key.
In the next set we joined them with a view on the field, a different defense and pressed on the service.
There was a lot of bad applications at the tie-break, and that's where we took it this way.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat the Russians.
It's a shame the beginning of the first set, that's where we missed it.
We were able to pull it off, but we missed the points.
The second set was great, and in the third it was a service decision.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was about five, and we hesitated a lot there.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in little yard number one?
Slučková: Similar to China in its backyards.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
It was 1:00 a.m., total silence, music didn't play, nothing.
That was different from downtown.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
How was the game preparation when you found out the names of your opponents an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was strange.
We started practicing for the game without knowing the anti-games, so we couldn't make tactical preparations for the other teams.
But Simon ( Coach Nausch) prepared a tactic for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactic paper ready, so on this side, we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
I don't think so.
We played at 7:30, but not at 12.
Birlov's Russian block in front of the playoffs at the OH in Rio.
Beach volleyballists Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermannová in front of the playoffs at the OH in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group from ten, we had the mode shifted earlier.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine another sport has athletes who have to serve their best performance at 12 o'clock.
But I think we've done the best we can.
We knew it would be, but it's not quite typical, and it's probably not gonna be my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the process of the group was our goal, it's okay on the one hand, good.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
I'll sleep from it and remember the Olympic tournament only positively from tomorrow.
Big brother's here, the first spying SIM is coming.
You can't escape her.
The new rules are intended to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to acquire SIM from one of the local operators during their stay in Thailand.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who, for example, work or marry in Thailand.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting Authority and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures to enable their location to be monitored are intended to be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, this is a means of maintaining national security that will allow the crime to be dealt with by a foreigner.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs are intended to help detect persons who exceed the permitted length of their stay.
In the case of sellers, a special SIM for foreigners should appear alongside SIM intended exclusively for Thais within six months.
Differentiation will be the monitoring function that will be permanently switched on in the case of cards intended for persons without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to shut it down.
"This function at SIM for Thailand is not, because you can always easily follow," Tantasith added.
It is necessary to add that in Thailand the subscription is not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller shall require an identity document.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators was handing out free-of-charge SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is also considered by ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia or Singapore.
They are also currently subject to mandatory SIM registration, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not imply an obligation for foreigners to acquire an operator when entering the country of SIM.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short.
After crossing the border, i.e. after logging in to their network, the operators of the country concerned only know the relevant network information.
They are therefore familiar with the telephone number, but not with information about the owner.
However, the difference between roaming prices and the rates of local operators is so far short that most tourists will start looking at local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to supervise the movement of foreigners were legally followed by immediate criticism by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and compares the prepared system to the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents in the context of privacy protection.
In addition, the police will need a court order if necessary to monitor a particular person.
For any abuse of the system, there will be a threat of a more unidentified punishment.
"If the service provider follows the location of SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While at present the number will be recycled only after the 90-day period after which the SIM did not sign up for the network, it would be possible to renew the number after 15 days in the event of leaving Thailand.
Luxury apartment in the new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in the new building?
We've been looking for a carefree apartment where most of the real estate care will be provided by the caretaker.
The condition was enough parking spaces and elevators in the house, which basically disqualified older buildings.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, issues with swinging floors, high energy performances, etc.
The condition was also large terraces, which old construction is not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in Modern apartment magazine.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer and her colleague Kamila Poláková from the Artigo studio.
Why did you just address them?
Would you recommend collaborating with everyone's expert?
Cooperation with the architect would be recommended to everyone, if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of possible materials and are able to fit the interior according to the client's wishes.
We worked with architect Lenka Langer already on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation from another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with an appropriate background for a four-member family conceived as a modern but not a cold interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment to the terraces and implement smart household control.
And of course, the quality of the implementation had to be mitigated.
Did you leave everything on the experts, or did you yourself interfere in the final form of the interior?
All the proposals, including technical drawings and samples of materials, were approved, but the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we established what we expected from the design and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that it is our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund who helped the architect to focus on our taste.
The combination of black, white and walnut wood was the idea of an architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc.
Have there been any complications during the implementation of which you had to give up your original ideas or, on the contrary, join the new ones?
Perhaps only in the introductory phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment when it was possible to climb up to the height of our floor for the first time, and found that the views we were planning are actually shadowing the surrounding buildings.
That's when we literally changed the layout overnight from scratch.
Granule was used on the kitchen line as well as on the lining of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces supplemented with leather, such as the bulging of Norma's dining and bar chairs from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make some changes or is there something you wish otherwise today?
I believe this is a modern air interior, which primarily fulfils its purpose.
We do not prepare the changes, most of the modifications after move took place in the plane of shielding and settlement of terraces.
Perhaps the only excuse is to the floor when walnut wood shows itself to be too delicate for a dog’s home.
Word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the implementation.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, therefore it was possible to make a completely new layout solution and several further modifications within the construction.
For the interior is an important element of placing the sun tunnel into the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet.
That's how we got the daylight into the darker apartment.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the rooftop terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications which was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
The swimming pool and hot tub are also included.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says the Muslim living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where were you living before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, just off the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon, and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, so I got to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel suffocated in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere amongst people.
I thought every Frenchman was very negative.
The people in France are being negatively tuned in general, but things have been getting worse lately.
It's interesting that you're referring to negativeism.
Some people like that evaluate the Czech character.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel that way when they come to France because they don't see it as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
Money is a big topic.
People feel that they have little money, but the minimum wage in France is 15 hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now, there's a problem with people's behaviour towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started to look at me through his fingers just because I'm a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job practically anywhere else and I came across an opening at Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn't even know Prague at first.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I had no idea what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't capture any negative reactions or abuses, but I feel like people are more free here.
That I could do anything, get dressed in any way, and no one would judge me.
In France, you're always uncomfortable with someone looking at you, like when you have special clothes and stuff.
I started to feel really single in Prague.
I don't think the Praguemen care about that kind of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for a travel site for a while.
Then another friend and I started a website on which people offer and look for shared housing.
We are only operating in Prague so far, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends, who are Czech in half, and two other Czech friends.
I must say that another specificity of the Czechs is that at first they hold more distance.
He's not letting anyone in on his body right now.
That's quite a difference from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on their faces.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have this simple enough in Prague, because hopefully everyone here speaks English.
Even in inns or in food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by being able to communicate in English at least a little bit, I have no need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you had any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Actually, no.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
There's one experience I can think of.
My manager, Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They are not French, they are Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But someone having a problem with me being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
Even though my colleague once warned me of some anti-Muslim demonstration.
He said don't go downtown, they're gonna call me names.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like this may happen in Prague, Paris, Nice or Brussels?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, nowadays, anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, perhaps I could not imagine something like this happening in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, people who kill aren't Muslims.
The Qur'an says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you see it when terrorists are entangled by your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I'm trying not to follow those reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at Jiří from Poděbrad Square.
On Wednesday, the Czech Muslims and the Christians demonstrated against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues are, for example, from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religiously established than I am, so sometimes we have a pretty wild discussion about Islam, because we all see it a little different.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, maybe Islam was taught at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with a woman's subordinate position.
How do you feel about that?
There's no way I'm submissive.
More like the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It has to do with the fact that you don't wear any headgear.
Hijab, for example?
And it's mostly signed the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is really a fundamental Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It's up to everyone to interpret it.
When you read the Qur'an, you should make your own opinion of these things.
So when I read in the Qur'an a passage which says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the sight of others, I said to myself, "I am not the wife of the Prophet, so why should I hide?"
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I travel to, for example, Iran or Saudi Arabia, where scarfs require, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the perfect city for that, I think.
The Czech Muslims, along with the Christians, demonstrated against violence.
Yachter Kozelska Fenclo's wind in Rio will blow up on the step-by-steps.
Friday's sea rides in Rio de Janiero, Brazil came out by Czech yachters Veronica Kozelské Fenclová.
In the Laser Radio class, she moved to the tenth place before the final two races.
This would ensure Czech Republic's participation in the final ride.
You'll collect the packages as pokemons.
They want to compete with carriers.
The idea is to use the planned journeys for transport of shipments by TV director Matěj Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
The idea was to inhale three applications with different geographical ranges.
National Application We launched the Transmitter in May.
At this point, there are thousands of cities recorded in it, and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this before we focus more on abroad, says the 40-year-old manager in an interview for iDNES.cz.
How do I transfer the app works and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data, how big a package you can transfer and how much you want for it.
Someone's asking for a transfer back on that day.
When the route and delivery time match, it pairs up and the two will be notified to each other.
That's when the cabin opens, where the couple can arrange a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register to always find a courier for each package?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't guess how many registered and how many routes you need to cover completely optimal and each offer paired up with demand.
It's already working on major moves, and it's logically easier than on the way between villages.
The more people, the more potential for speed and accuracy.
So far, people are building trust and finding out that no one will run away with the package.
So far, you haven't had to solve a case like this?
How many users have the service two months after launch?
At the moment, we have about 5 to 6,000 people who create roads.
We consider this a success, and we believe that there will be more.
Is there a risk that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to be a competition for large conglomerates only because we are able to deliver the matter, for example, on the same day and at a fraction of the price.
You'll pay a few thousand for delivery in two hours.
You could pay a hundred or less here, because that's the way someone's already doing business.
Should traditional carriers be worried about possible customer losses in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, huge multinationals feed here, as well as business chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they pay for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox that says they have a package to pick up at the branch first that day after 7:00.
At that time, I needed a package for six hours, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't bother anyone and send a signal to the competition, no matter how hard they try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither of them have ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses scheduled journeys between world capitals, especially by aircraft.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process a company that created applications for, for example, MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of the year and the application was marketed in March 2016.
The transport application began to develop in December last year and was released in May this year.
It is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The application was developed by Mesík and Mesík Profi since this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to make all these applications from the beginning, which will one day join into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to match the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, they also want to focus more on the global market.
The shared economy has recently been a topic and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Aren't you concerned about an area of action that no one can yet tell you where the boundaries of sharing are and where the grey economies are?
It's the same, just another product.
We know that if it succeeds and we go up there, we'll be another thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even though someone saves and makes money, it is not the intention to circumvent the financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, either on the one hand or on the other, will be encouraged to pay his income if he makes his income out of it.
What makes you think the service has so much potential?
The sender will save up and the transporter will earn and reduce the cost of the journey.
That's the strong idea that combines interest on both sides.
At the time of the social networks that people divide, we would like to see this one conversely.
Nice stories can arise, people are happy to help and talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
In my opinion, there's been a lack of personal access for a long time, and we're talking about this app, it's people's service.
So how do you guarantee the package courier doesn't escape?
Each user of the app together with the registration will scan the ID and indicate bank connections, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give the service and the credibility of the person.
The couriers also collect stars based on the ratings of the senders.
We also offer insurance, we still tune the details.
An uninsured consignment in case of loss or damage is guaranteed by a courier, but does not assume liability for content under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and does not know it.
If the police stop him and find him in a sealed package in his trunk with a machine gun or ten kilos of hashish, the criminal liability of the sender is overrun.
Is there no risk of any abuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered, if necessary, by an observable administrative authority, which will be the only one to have access to it, nor are we alone able to see it, the data are protected against abuse.
How much money does a courier get after a successful delivery?
The courier sets the price and gets the whole amount he wants.
The sender shall be charged several percent extra for the mediation of the contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push the volume.
No one can blame the courier for not delivering the shipment when he actually delivered it, takeover and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transfer anything.
We have three sizes, small as a butter cube, medium as a plate of eggs and as big as a beers' bass.
Then there's no more restrictions, and if anyone has a seat in the car, they can take the fridge.
Plus the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack it unless you want to hide the contents.
You're gonna put your shirt in the courier's hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea, and how long did it take to start the service?
My friend got the idea more than two years ago, and I wasn't paying much attention back then.
Then he showed me a demo app with a transnational range that focuses mainly on passengers by plane.
That's when I told him I wasn't going to look for an investor, but I'd like to become one myself and make savings.
The next year we continued to develop, than we established Shippansee LTD in London due to greater creditworthiness of the entire product.
But this isn't a version that you're focused on right now.
No, we focused marketing on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to capture the application, because it all had labor pain and is still something to solve and improve.
We are trying to respond to customer feedback and we are not dealing with so much the foreign market at the moment.
We know it's a long run, but we don't care, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way upgraded.
I will transfer it when we say that the national segment can be much more interesting and that we will at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third Mesh app is local, for the city.
But it can send the package to the exact address even across the world.
It works for the senders as well as I will transport, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocation device in your mobile phone.
The courier applications that want to do so are called Mesik Profi.
So someone can make money by picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the latest application will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the trip to work.
Now that everyone's fooling around with the pots, they can pick this up exactly the same way.
One sees where the city has orders, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and takes the shipment.
It's cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we are still doing a web interface that will be crucial for the shipping companies, fill in data about them on the website, or create points on the map.
Then we are able to invoice them every month.
Are you now dedicated to the project full-time?
It makes us uncomfortable, but we normally have it in our jobs so that we can feed and develop the project.
There's a strong multinational investor behind us, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other got into it with other incentives and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to be able to manage with us not the Czech market, but who should, with forgiveness of the ball, go with us into a global product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story piece of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten diversity.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will, according to the first information, be more varied than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is to be based on the concept of a net lattice in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, includes the possibility of using a combat Titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels focused on skillful movement.
They'll be like the platformers, and they'll include the reindeer.
For example, double jumps, running on walls and cable slides are essential to their overcoming.
In addition, sometimes enemies will have to be destroyed.
There will be no maps that resemble mazes and levels with special concepts.
For example, one can lift and slide platforms and close a huge door.
You're going to modify the shape of a battlefield.
The pace of the game should therefore be compressed between angry events and calmer moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We're gonna play for a pawn named Jack Cooper dreaming of a pilot career.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper, along with Captain Lastimos, will crash on the extraterrestrial planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there won't even be a wild one for him.
In addition, in the event of a crash, the Lastimos will lose his fatal wounds, and that's why Cooper will be tasked with setting up the captain's Titan.
His dream of a pilot career will come true before he expected.
The first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot's repair.
Cooper's calls to the Titan will be significant.
Players will serve as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time robot isolated communications will create humorous moments.
For example, if titanium is going to name the drought all the injuries that Cooper is threatened with when he's going to jump.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign brought the Polygon server.
The result will be possible to evaluate in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is released on October 28, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will come to life, but the original label remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the failure of THQ, in 2013 it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and company name.
For example, Nordic released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, 23 games are being created for publishing, and 13 of them have not yet been discovered.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a 20-year-old man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first apparently tried for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she used to date someone like her before me.
She's completely crazy about him.
The first days she even changed her voice, had a girly, in love with her voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I've been watching the whole thing.
He went out of work regularly at half past four, so she always left at 3:00 for shopping.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later, I found out they were meeting at his house in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got the keys, he was determined I'd catch them there.
But I don't know why, after all, I always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go there, take the decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife has been controlling me.
Soon I think she found out that I'm controlling, that I'm gonna do what she wants.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a piece of shit.
At the time, the neighbors indicated to me that they also knew about it.
I was such an idiot, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all broke down, it would be bad.
That it would happen to everyone in the family, only a daughter knew something.
So I've always put it off, on and on.
But I went to his apartment once, and I needed help with something in the laundry room.
He went in there with me, and I told him that I got anonymity, that he was seeing my wife, and that she was suggesting everything.
I asked him what he'd say.
He was standing there, he was moaning his shoulders, he was looking at the ground and he didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife on the way from the store at that time.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond, and she didn't tell me anything.
Nobody told me anything at the time.
I'm the kind of person who's never really gone anywhere that has a problem getting to know someone, let alone find a woman.
So I didn't even think about getting a divorce.
I was still counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all this, and life will go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've basically never dealt with all of this.
I still have it in me.
I used to let her know a lot about it, but I finally gave it up for peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's industrious.
I think she's always tried to make me have no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's nice.
But sometimes I want to pet her, hug her, and she won't let me.
At the same time, we go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me that she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see he still loves him, he's her god.
And I don't like that kind of life.
When it started and I was carrying it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live, and I asked her what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it, and she said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France is escalating the fight against radical Islamists, and the local Muslim minority is also calling for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who undermine public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
It also wants to stop financing mosques from abroad, when preachers vaccinated with jihad often come with money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It should have already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, she was affected by internal differences, and it never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," said Valls.
The new foundation is headed by the former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as supporter of the secular state.
There are some 2500 mosques and prayers in France, some 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have banished about 80 Islamic clergymen from the country, and they are considering this step for a few more decades.
This week, the German police have also acted against the Jihadist clergy.
The Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated an area where the believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Right after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the French debate about a new institution that will replace the non-functional foundation became a reality.
Everything hastened other terrorist attacks by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new Foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to oversee Imams.
However, it is not yet clear where it will get funding, even though several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special charge for hall food, i.e. meat from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
This tax would in practice be paid by the food vendors of the hall, for granting the authorisation.
A part of the money would then travel to the Foundation's budget.
The contribution of EUR 10 to 20 could also be paid by French pilgrims who are going to Mecca.
Each year, about 30,000 journeys from France to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers who have passed educational programmes at the universities there should operate in the French mosques.
This should ensure that their preaching is consistent with democracy.
The government also closes radical mosques.
"Since December we have closed 20 of them and the others will follow," said the Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve.
"In France, there is no place for those who proclaim hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was badly injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at the shopping mall in northern Spain Zaragoza, writes a journal Independent.
There was a shooting after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man waited in the car outside the shopping mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes the Independent.
My wife was taken to the hospital by an unharmed daughter, and for critical men, an ambulance must have arrived.
The crime occurred around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous area of Aragonia, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press writes the Independent that the motive was probably the unsolved recent divorce of both partners.
Wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes light, well digestible meals, only we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our head.
And so from the summer gardens smells like grilled cartilage, buns, pork stakes.
Not very healthy, not very light, not so often with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
True, barbecue is time-saving as well as dishes, plus it's a social matter, and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to making good meals, which special dining, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or suffocate.
And they will contribute to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where high-quality ingredients and a few well-adapted grifs are enough to make the preparation fun and food a real exotic delicacy itself.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, even, rice is a little bit more time-consuming and chilling.
The paper can only be softened in the water for a moment, and then it's all about the chef's fantasy of how he's going to play with the fillings and accessories.
She's not an eyelash.
The advantage of a number of Asian cuisines today is that raw materials are usually already available.
Including sweet sour ginger, which is one of the basic flavors accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the true pink gari ginger has a unique spicy spicy and at the same time delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe that mixes with several kinds of vinegar and ginger.
So just buy a bag of appropriate size, and the annex with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used especially in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes as part of various festive occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed banana leaves are very widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America as well as a "help" to prepare a variety of roasted, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed into them similar to the alobal.
The banana leaf then gives food a specific flavor.
In our country we can buy in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
But choose only the leaves richly green, and therefore healthy - unbroken and spotless.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad made of wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be bought again frozen.
He who often eats or prepares sushi will probably know the algae of the nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves – i.e. plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame - dark green algae growing in the waters around Hokkaidó - it is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the algae of the nori.
By the way, anyone who doesn't know a bowl of wakame soup is supposed to be using Asian women to recover from birth.
And even this eyelash has almost miraculous effects.
He cleans blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents hair from grayening and is literally loaded with mineral substances.
Dried and crushed wakame also serves as spices, such as flavoring rice.
The fresh algae first allow to be hatched in the water, then flushed, put in boiling water and cook for half a minute.
Then they cool down in the ice water, cut out the middle ribs, and further adjust, like a favorite salad.
However, buying it already finished, frozen, is the simplest solution.
So the only thing left to do is tangle the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a bomb of longevity.
Unless you resist and throw in an extra grilled bun.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a bit of skill, and you have an interesting fresh meal that mixes flavors deliciously.
And it's done once.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrot, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green asparagus, 60 g of salad cucumber, 60 g of algae wakame and 60 g of sweet chili sauce.
A cake of chopped coriander, a spoon of black sesame, a spoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of manga and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little of pine nuts.
First, we'll get the rolls ready.
We'll soak the rice paper for five seconds in cold water.
Then we'll take it out and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, in hot water, we will cook asparagus shoots briefly, and after about three minutes we will let them cool off quickly into the ice water so that they do not lose their color.
Put the vegetable filling on the allowed paper and pack it.
We prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, which we cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
Put asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add rolls, and finish the whole dish with a wakame algae, pickled ginger, a mango slice, sprinkle with a black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-point rugby, the choice of Fiji takes gold
The impressive performance of the United Kingdom in the seven-point rugby ended with a devastating lead on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated in the final match on Thursday night British at the stadium Deodoro here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijiians presented a master lesson in processing, landfilling, folds, support game, running on the line and brutal forces - and gained gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an uncharted prize of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third on that day - and the British could have been proud of their performances at the inaugural Olympic tournament of the seven-piece rugby, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hardened victory over the 7:5 South Africans in the semifinal on the same day may have froze in the finale.
However, Fiji would defeat a 15-member team in full health in its form.
It's not going to be any comfort for the British, but they can be glad that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their neck tomorrow: the top coach of Fiji is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has gone a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost the only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, the British's penetrations reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a series of buses in motion and the World Cup champions were leading 5:0, when Osea Kolinisau appeared from around the corner.
The timer showed up for four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing of the conversion.
12:0 and Britain has hardly touched the ball.
Great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only Fiji slowed down.
In the seventh minute, he threw Jas Veremalua touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another and there was still more than 1 minute left on the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Rawou then penetrated the tiny British and hit the line where he scored.
After conversion to state 29:0 the break followed.
It was as if Fiji was born for the 7s rugby, while the British were still learning handing over.
That's how it is.
After half the time, the British made mass changes, and the Fijian influx stopped... for four whole minutes, which was good, compared to the first half, until after the brilliant interplay of Fiji, Josua Tuisova penetrated.
Dan Norton tried to gain an opportunity for the British, tossed a touchdown into the left corner to increase an 36:7. The match had long since been won by the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans sang, waved, and danced.
It was hard not to admire the completely joyous approach of the Fijians.
At the end of the day, Mata Viliame had further tried to sweeten the Fijian victory.
There was a whistle, the Fijians hugged themselves, and the British fell on the lawn completely depleted.
Even before that, Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 on the same day in the semifinal, and Britain conquered South Africa in a close semifinal - the difference between one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half of the lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling foot work, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
The great late dump of Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the 15th England team, ensured victory - and in the end also a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the fight against cancer to win the rowing race
You won't find more emotional gold on these Games, and that's something to say.
From the first shot to the last, during the 220 breaths in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning at their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although two were sitting at the olympics, there were three voices in the boat, when the boat swirled on the surface to meet the other Olympic gold behind it in the female pair race, there was still the voice of the still present coach Robin Williams with them. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve this result.
Their predominance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying on water with the elegance of swans - does not reflect the nature of victory entirely.
For every gold medal from rowing, there's a auxiliary battalion that's a little bit different, and no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he was going to live that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer that can be operated on, and I had this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's gonna change your mind.
The cancer was detected to Williams in December 2013.
Happiness for the whole trio was that he could enter treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and thus shorten the loss to a minimum - if we can call it this under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get back together fast.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking in the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet when they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is the way, but this was a bit more demanding.
Immediately after winning were their first thoughts of Williams, who was very nervous this morning, he spoke less than usual as he tried to cope with his own unrest.
Stanning, the captain of the regiment of the Royal Artillery, who had a mission in Aghanistan, said: “This week I was down with emotions, it may be a little extreme, but it means so much.”
Once again, it highlights how much this means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and so has Robin.
Until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he owns a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better man for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose one race in five years.
The pair put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn't cope with.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We focused at the moment.
Helen screamed, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't want to achieve anything fantastic.
We weren't looking forward to fireworks today, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to think about it before they decide what happens next.
Glover's getting married next week, and her future TV adventurer is Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I have a much better feeling about this," she said.

Prison?
More likely to carry people for free, says Taximaf Hunter Rubesh to a groundbreaking prosecution.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate in Prague are, according to ČT, defendants.
You have recorded a series of reports that reveal fraudulent practices and those to be in a court-martialed group.
You've faced a few unpleasant fights with exposed actors.
How much is the report on the indictment of members of the organized group broken down for you?
I was expecting a trial to happen.
I'm particularly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's useless.
They should primarily return all the stolen money.
And they should put them back so that they can carry all the people for free.
That's a rather ecstatic solution.
Does this mean, then, that you do not regard a possible punishment as sufficiently effective?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so scared that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one of them is pinglo, the other one's taking out pizza, and one of them just bailed on it.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in jail.
You think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I'm having trouble taking my freedom away.
I find it a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
People like that should restore the company they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they have committed the destruction of our country’s name and the taking of people.
So let them do a good card now and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work like a community service.
As someone goes to collect trash, they'd get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll get parole in the end and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and then at the Tomáš Bati University in Zlín.
They belong to people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of shows, now he is preparing the Prague Guide programme, which is intended primarily for foreign audiences.
Rubesh advises them, in the form of short reports, what services it prefers to avoid in Prague, and what it recommends to use without fear.
He used to film a series with names How to, City of Deception?, Life in Luxury, Enough! and Prague vs. Dust.
The prosecution calls them an organized group.
The police followed her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mobsters?
They're like cute mobsters, not the kind we know from Godfathers.
They're more of a mobster - juniors, but they're organized for sure.
Only in the fact that they watch each other's relays (Taxi Station).
Prague is completely fragmented.
I observed that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Vary (disco club)
Everyone's just looking out for their place, and every group is organized somehow.
It's probably a complex network.
But the defendants are only seven people, six taxi drivers, and one former magistrate who warned the driver about the controls.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon did not disappear from the streets.
So what percentage of the Prague taxi frauds you're guessing to be?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst are still on the street.
I'm talking about Aleš Ryjáček, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he drives a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at Charles Bridge and drives people.
The last time I went with him, he asked me for seven hundred in three kilometers.
His police didn't arrest him for a reason.
Only a few people from the whole big group were chosen.
However, the same situation is also found in other locations in Prague.
The indictment of seven people thus makes it difficult to extermination the already famous Prague nevary, which seems to have much larger dimensions.
Of course, it's no use at all.
It will help, but all evil will not be eradicated, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still perform in the same places you showed in the reports, namely the Charles Bridge or Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day, and every day they break the decrees.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague Magistrate.
It's not even a cat, it's a total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even though they are only part of the group, will be brought to trial.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask you, do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is, and will always be, to improve the centre of Prague.
And even if I feel like it's gonna take a little bit better, I'm gonna keep going.
You need to push on the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief remains, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't settle for that.
But it's not like that, there's more of them, of course.
Are you still trying to confront them in taxis?
Sometimes I take test drive and I have to say, it's still bad.
I just caught a cab driver last week, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometers, although he then claimed it was CZK 56 (he used a decimal-line trick).
He had a receipt for it, the cops came in, and this cab driver was so cute, he still went to the cops and asked them when they were finally getting the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taxi meter glued the decimal line and robbed tourists by CZK 357.
Can it be said that the insolence of fraudulent taxi drivers did not give way even after you showed the faces of those who charged senseless amounts for a short ride?
Their insolence is still incredible.
How'd it end with the cab driver who made 56 crowns?
The cops sent him away, saying they couldn't discuss him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And that, I think, will be a problem even in that court (six taxi drivers and one ex-officer).
There's gonna be a cab driver on one side with his receipts on the other side of the police.
However, according to the Supreme Administrative Court's ruling, the magistrate may not use classified records of a taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming the pieces about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves made me aware of this precedent.
I'm the footage, but I've always wanted to use it for the story.
Are you concerned that this fact could protect them even from trial?
I hope every judge understands that no cab driver could drive six or ten crowns per kilometre because he wouldn't make a living.
You've been talking about a decimal-line trick, which, in particular, underwater taxi drivers move in front of foreign clients.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they concerned about this feature after the release of your reports continue to be used?
I think we've made this trick popular by broadcasting the show.
I was driving a cab driver recently, bragging about him being the honest cab driver.
Then I noticed, however, that from the side of the taxameter the black cardboard had been glued.
When I asked him what it had in it, he said to me, "You know what it is."
If fines didn't work too well on taxi drivers, can they be warned by the court with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can keep them from cheating?
You talked about how you think they'll always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can stop them.
But someone can push them out of these places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
In my experience, I must say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunate to prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have taste, but they miss um.
He doesn't know much about it, and he can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (because of the proposal for a comprehensive restriction coming from Mayor Adriana Krnáčová's office), it did not sound very clearly what they wanted.
They once said they didn't protest Uber, they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they were just blocking Prague, and it created only the best possible ad for Uber.
How do you assess the approach of the Prague Magistrate in the solution to the problem of overimpact?
It's obvious the police had to step in to solve something.
The magistrate was short.
They had a mole there that was leaking information, which means that the taxi department had been doing their job for years for nothing.
I hope they charge that officer to the last check, all the failed checks, to see what he's done.
I think that's the worst part.
I was even with him on one check-up, which I found out only then from their schedule.
A few months have passed since the final series was published.
What's the response?
I mean mostly foreign viewers, before the series is actually the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I let them play the videos.
And then when we go down the Old Town Square, there's a surprise that the same people that are seen on the footage are really standing.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd build a slab around them to make people look at them.
Museum of Communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab when you need it?
Sure.
I drive services that I don't pay cash for, but a card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are many dispatches that are fair.
I've only taken a cab in the street once since.
The driver said to me after he got into the car, "Well, you have the guts."
To be disguised as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were already mentioned in 2005.
In the same year, Mayor Pavel Bém set off for a check-up as an Italian tourist, and immediately at the first attempt, the driver cheated on him by 200.
Editor Rubesh had worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him for driving from Staroměstské to Wenceslas Square 820 kroner, which is based on approximately 195 kroner per kilometre as calculated by the reporters.
The Prague Magistrate set a maximum price of CZK 28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising figures in the recorded report: for example, a two-mile road from Paris to Truhlářská was a tourist of 400 crowns.
Dear rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge.
They charge about CZK 6,500 for a ride to the Angel, which is 2.5 km long.
The marble is washed mainly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and as long as it takes, the better.
The dirt comes from it well, even though sometimes dirt has to be put down by a scalpel, it has to be excavated from the folds.
It's not easy and it can't be fast, the restaurant Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov in Hájy approached her work.
Hat down in front of it: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, after which it is often necessary to climb and again to climb.
"The restaurantist should be careful, patient and unsustainable in the working environment," she said.
It's not her first restoration job in Frydlantland.
Thanks to it, the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Frýdlantské town hall were restored, as well as the statues of St.Mary Magdalena in Zátiš, St.John of Nepomuk in Frýdlanta, Piet in Frýdlantská Okręžní Street, Mariánský Pillar in Frýdlant or the Atlantic in front of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
The restoration of Melchior, Kryštof and Kateřina from Redern started in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the application of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts are ensured against falling and shifting; either they are anchored into the wall or toward each other.
The treatment and preservation of the surface also awaits them.
The texts on the tomb will be golded again.
"Then it begins by gilding inscriptions on marble plates with pure slice gold," said the Deputy Minister of State Monumental Care of the City Office in Frýdlant Věra Sobotová.
There's no record of the gravestone going through any repairs in the past.
As they look closer, they take the holes, drilled in marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old, and they're leftovers after the tombstone's decoration.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the Swedish raid during the Thirty Years War, everything disappeared.
They literally brushed the tombstone, said Saturday.
The Church of Finding the Holy Cross is a restaurant with a slight exaggeration like home.
After the flood in 2010 it was necessary to put the tombstones that were found underwater, the baptismal woman was restored, wall paintings in the tomb, and now the tombstone.
"We would also like to go to the viper in the future," said Saturday.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, we put money into maintenance and repairs every year.
Restaurant work on the restoration of the redernov tombstone will total 128 000 crowns.
They will be covered with subsidies, the city will not put any money into this part of the recovery.
A hundred thousand crowns will go from winning in the regional round of the competition The historic city of 2015; the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, specified by the Mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The representative decided to release the winnings for the restoration of the tombstone.
Opinions of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one month and a half years.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who else would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The American S&P500 index, which was going through 12% of the corrections in February, is now at its new historical maximum and has already registered 7% since the beginning of the year.
Thus, the iron rule is reaffirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which they have always achieved in the long term.
In a situation where US stocks are at their historical maximum, volatility is disappearing again, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown successfully and fearlessly due to the quantitative easing of the US central bank, and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) has remained stable below 12 percent.
And not to be.
Although the Fed markets are still preparing for a gradual increase in interest rates, the quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England has also put its hand in the work, which will buy £70 billion in bonds in the next six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing is pushing already so low yields below and contributes to almost complete elimination of risk and fear from the future.
How long will this condition last?
That, of course, is a million-dollar question.
But at present there are no risks, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without greater fluctuations, the commodity market situation, and China is stabilising, and there is essentially no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if US shares continue to endure in a similarly calm regime.
Too bad Juncker isn't studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and demanding task.
I wanted this difficult work by an experienced policy, said the head of the European Commission, Juncker, when French policy (really experienced, because it was so many different transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to look for) appointed the European Commission as the main negotiator of the conditions for the departure of Great Britain from the EU.
Juncker's choice blew off the hope that it is in the EU's grave interest to seek the form of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
But most of the British media accepted the name Barnier as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
He hates Britain.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He took it as he could: the hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and model of capitalism.
The supporter of multilateral regulation was co-author of the concept of a so-called banking union, and with a grudge for everything coming from the City Financial Centre in London, he has passed the legislation of excessively tough regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a hard, unbreakable and apparently even reckless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how to remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance sheet, an overview and the ability to empathize Prime Minister Klaus contributed so much.
That is why today Czechs and Slovaks can be closest friends and allies.
Too bad Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this one.
It'd be good for everyone!
An earthquake around Putin?
The King of the Kremlin has released his loved one Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from the post of president of the presidency on Friday.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
Russian media informed about this with an appeal to the Kremlin press service notice.
Putin indicated Ivan's release at his own request.
At a meeting with Rossija TV station 24, the president said that he was coming to meet Ivan's wishes when he took office that he wanted to be head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the President's administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's current representative Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is one of Putin’s closest associates.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, held the position of Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now leave the chair of a member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov said, at the meeting with Putin, that he was actually a record-breaking leader at the head of the administration.
It lasted four years and eight months.
In this connection, he recalled that 11 people had been replaced in this capacity 25 years after its establishment.
Kvitová and the deblisty Uncle Šafářová won't play the finals.
So far, none of the Friday tennis matches have been able to turn into the finals.
She was the first to lose her fight, Petra Kvitová, who fell under Puerto Rican surprise Monica Puig after sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitová was followed by Czech deblists Šafářívá and Stýcová.
In the first set, the Slayers of the Williams sisters reached for the win, but they lost two sets, and the Russians finally took the set in the shortened game.
The second set then lost the ratio of 4:6.
Half the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skier Andrew Synek won his semifinals with an overview when he defeated the other Damir Martin from Croatia despite the slowing in the end by almost a second.
Good morning, conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, said Son.
It was his opponents who, unlike him, had to fight for progress.
So they took some strength away, and that could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing cards, said the oar of Prague Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Knapko did not walk in Snyk's footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower in today's semi-final took the fourth position in her driving, and on Saturday she will start in the B finals and fight for 7th to 12th place.
Gold doesn't come from London like that.
For the first time at the Olympics, I didn't advance to the finals.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I was driving a high-quality race, and I put everything I could into it.
The opponents were just better, the Topinka Knapková bowed before them.
She fought to the end and believed that she would be among the elite six in her fourth games.
She gave up the fight right before the target.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could step out of that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it through the Austrians to the finals.
Unfortunately, she was driving a life race today, told the 2011 World Champion.
Far beyond the final gates in Rio remained the young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who for the second time failed to break through the qualification, this time the little one lying down.
It's where Nephew took 33rd place.
The qualification was the best thing for the Russians.
From the first place Sergey Kamenski with 629 points, from the second Kiril Grigorjan (628.9).
Nepuchal's shot was 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke to the program in Rio for the first time, among them also Czech seven-leaguess Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
2nd place of the Olympic Competition is the second place, Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is the 22nd place.
Headed by British woman Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as well as the second Belgian woman Nafissata Thiam.
Both took care of the historically best altitude performance within the seven-fight.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look at the absurdity of such questions: the German society has gone through deep self-reflection, but not Russian.
In the 20th century, both great Euro-Asian nations saw dictators, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed to the 94 million victims of communism, as reported in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was a daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent leadership of war or inhuman experiments.
Inhumanly, the Nazis have wiped out about 6 million Jews, and I'm guessing the total victims of World War II are 60 million.
The Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities in the occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany and in the USSR, not only a few were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passively or simply through cowardice or by sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not just a specific of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal, came immediately to an end.
Most important, however, came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask, "Daddy, Grandpa, why were you involved in such atrocities?"
How could you?
This has brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elite has cared mainly for the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of its citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they are certainly not interested in joining back Alsako-Lotrinsko or someone - to rematch - to attack militaryly - hopefully everyone will.
There was no major reflection after the Cold War lost in Russia.
The window of possible positive changes was finally closed at the turn of the millennium when the former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The politics of Putinovy Russia is the revention, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of our own people is no value to the heifer.
Beat yours, and the strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that this is just the decades of the despot regime, that the Russians are not genetically or culturally less valuable - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from the increase in tension around Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In the last days and hours, the situation at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated.
Who benefits from tension growth?
After a long period of relative peace, the relations between Ukraine and Russia have deteriorated again.
The pretext of the Ukrainian Party became the peninsula of Crimea, which was joined more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both hostile parties contradict each other, and it is difficult to independently verify them, so we have the opportunity to think about an old, familiar question to whom does it benefit?
According to the Moscow reports, there have been terrorist attacks on the Crimean side, which, of course, rejects Ukraine and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information on the arrest of Ukrainian Special Forces in Russia came from the case of pilot Savchenková's well-known response that they were allegedly abducted in Russia.
If we approach the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further reinforcement of sanctions and reinforcement of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, there has been a retreat from the situation in Ukraine against the background of the immigration crisis in Europe.
Ukrainian leadership has already lost total credit to its citizens when President Poroshenko's current support is around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would long ago have been bankrupt not to be generous financial injections by the EU and mainly the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention again to its country in order to justify its further applications for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the force forces once again want to prove themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It is not but to hope that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will ultimately realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but of all ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and will stop their hostile actions in time.
For the first time in eight months, Bulgaria reported inflation
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate reached 1 % in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous period of 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2 % compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in the travels of these consumer goods groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
The price decrease occurred in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
The prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
U.S. Secret Service reportedly watched Russian hacker attacks for a year.
The Russian attacks were made public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the Party's Democratic headquarters.
However, no official report on the Russian part of the attack is mentioned.
Moscow denied the attack.
The report on the alleged Russian attack was top secret, because it would reveal that the U.S. Secret Service is monitoring the hacking attack and it could also be how they do it and what resources they use.
There were two Russian intelligence services involved in the attack.
New Cyber Security Advisory Council
The tracer material was encoded and only had access to it a small group of experts, wrote Reuters.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight top members of Congress, called the gang of eight, was informed.
It is made up of the heads of both Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the leaders of the Democrats in both Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid Chambers, and four members of the Congress Defence and Security Committees.
The Head of the Democratic Party, Donna Brazil, announced on Thursday that she was setting up a Cyber Security Advisory Council, "to prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of the Democratic Party servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in a smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's initiative for health problems following the consumption of salmon wild smoked food - pieces 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016 was carried out by the Prague Hygiene Shops Albert at Wenceslas Square and Na Most.
The audit found that the L23012562/T4 batch with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which was notified by the customer, was no longer available and therefore the product was withdrawn from the same batch with the date of consumption of 11.12.2016.
The laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasite worm of the digestion tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for a person - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen, and man-eating live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Štich.
We are very sorry to our customers for their problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrawn that lot from the sale, and for preventive reasons we also withdrawn all other lots of this item.
There was a mistake on the supplier's side, and at the same time, we had this product tested, said New spokesperson Alberta Barbora Vanko to the spokesperson.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it in any of the chains and get the money back.
Larvae destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton Vrnátina.
The health authorities informed the Prague and Central Bohemian veterinary authorities about the occurrence of a dangerous product.
According to the server, safety of food.cz people after eating a parasite may become ill with anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or disease can occur without a symptom, said the CTK.
The symptoms occur one hour to two weeks after consumption of under-treated infected fish.
After three weeks of the onset of the disease, larvae usually spontaneously leave the gastrointestinal tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures and are therefore killed either by sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or by freezing it.
The veterinarians have currently checked salmon with the consignee of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had parasites in them.
The shipment with 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Expeditioned, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, was to date 919 packaging.
Currently, there is a download of unsold stock of products from stores, said Czech spokesperson Petr Pejchal on Friday.
Veterinaries prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse immediately after finding positive samples.
Seventeen-year-old British woman wanted to escape Austria, apparently killed by a Russian air raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and fast marriage to the jihadite, who was soon killed, sobering came.
The expected caliphate paradise turned to hell for the British girls on a land from which there was no escape.
The girl, according to her relatives, was in contact with her sister Halima.
She made repeated calls to Britain and said she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have an order without thinking about shooting, quotes The Telegraph lawyer of the family of the deceased girl Tasnim Akunje.
The last clues led to Rakka, the last call was from the girl.
Then there's only a report of her death, which you can't verify.
The family was communicating with her from an apartment in East London.
Together, they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they were hoping to meet their former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, because the house she was staying in was compared in May with the land of the air raid, reported the British ITV News.
The TV added that the bomb had apparently taken down a Russian plane that attacked the IS bastion in Syria.
You would have taken blue from the sky to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, family's lawyer.
In the week when (Kadiza) thought about fleeing from Islamic State territory, one Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to the information available, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think Kadiza interpreted it as a warning and decided not to risk it, according to the BBC Akunjee.
A family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and 15-year-old friends from Shamima Begum School and Amira Abas went on the road last February 17.
The only thing they said at home was that they were going out.
However, they headed to and from Gatwick Airport via Turkey in IS-controlled territory.
The family of a girl, according to a lawyer, did everything she could to get Kadiza back.
You would have taken the blue one out of the sky to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything it could to get her daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught themselves, the lawyer delivered.
The only positive thing he thinks is that Kadiza's fate can serve as a deterrent case for other girls or even boys who are being fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went there, they realized how they had things there, they understood how far it was different from the promises of the Islamic State propaganda, and they wanted to go back," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadizian classmates is unknown.
However, since they were also silent, their families need to accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveray was a regional center and the seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the mid-18th century, courts and basement under the hall have served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts lived were pitiful, and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them and a lot of them.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more friendly to the prisoners, had heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it has not been operational for long, for economic reasons since the end of August 1889, as the smaller repair facilities were costly to operate and did not pay too much.
The stories of the convicts and the ghost hunt.
For the public, the prison opened a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new building to see for themselves how different conditions prevailed in them.
Guides in day costumes still empower authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was finger-breaking or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked into one of the cells, mostly because of a photograph of a monument, or to create a feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, Inveray prison is one of the most famous Scottish sites where it is supposed to be haunted.
There have been several groups of hunters of paranormal activities and still the museum allows people to come hunting ghosts.
Such a night, however, will come to 300 pounds, which is approximately 9,500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animation, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
Snapchat every day allows about 150 million users to change reality and to mess with the identity of ways that border absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog, or a character that looks like it's coming out of Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million upgraded selfies every day.
Any error shall be made public immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past earned criticism with accusations that the application promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white shades of skin as the ideal of beauty.
So when the users offered this week a filter that made their eyes dirty, crooked teeth and inflated faces, some critics called it the racist cartoon of Asians, "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeated disputed questions point to the greater problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and indignation spread rapidly, and Snapchat immediately said the next day that he cancelled the function.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a presentation of accounts to an animated characters, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But the observers who witnessed racism reminded the filter of painful stereotypes in action.
The others without packaging refused comparison with the anims.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, stated in an e-mail that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that “it is difficult to argue against the comparison of obvious Asian caricature and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is drawn to the scorning extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has exceeded these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from the conference halls in corporations to Holywood and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially differentiated than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
“When a Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to a user, ” said 25 - year - old Katie Zhu on Thursday in an interview, “it’s very difficult to do these things today without notice as it was before.”
Katie Zhuová, a product manager and designer who works for the Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and invited others to do the same.
In an article for the Medium and in an interview on the phone, she stated that she is convinced that racially motivated problems reflect the lack of diversity when recruiting workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuová criticized the predominant white, completely male management of the company and ended the article with the hash tag: # DownloadeSnapchat.
"It is either that there is no diversity and colour among the employees at the moment when these things are decided on," Zhuová, who has a Chinese-American origin, said, "or color people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak."
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish numbers relating to the diversity of its employees, with the fact that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but according to the spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter who should focus on the insufficiently represented population and internal inclusion proceedings.
Zhuová adds: “I’m curious if they really need other users who can say that it’s not okay,” with their account being cancelled.
Army officers distorted intelligence on IS, says the parliamentary committee
In a report issued on Thursday, the Parliamentary Committee stated that officers from the Central Command of the United States changed intelligence reports to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events of the country.
According to the preliminary report of the Working Group drawn up by the Republican President of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Sub-Committee, there was a “extensive dissatisfaction” among the analysts of the Central Intelligence Service, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of the US effort to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is an army central in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release states: “The appearances of intelligence services approved by Centcom’s superiors usually offered a more positive picture of the anti-terrorism efforts of the US than was confirmed by the facts on the ground, and were more consistently positive than those obtained from other parts of the intelligence community. ”
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when a wrong analysis is presented to the superior policy makers," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican from California.
The failure to lead the Centcom goes to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the continuing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing US efforts in the training of the Iranian forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decisive evidence that the senior leaders of Obama’s administration ordered that the reports be amended, the report states that analysts felt pressured by the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many central staff press releases, statements and congress statements were significantly more positive than what happened,” says the report.
For example, the Centcom representative publicly stated that a major military attack on the takeover of Mosul could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is clear after months of investigation," said MP Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican Party from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest position of US Central Intelligence Officers was manipulated with the results of the intelligence services of staff in order to ignore the risk of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans assembled a working group after hearing about the concerns of analysts that intelligence services related to the Islamic State are being manipulated.
Following a report published on Thursday, a further investigation must follow.
There is a further investigation conducted by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence in the Centcom intelligence services.
On Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"In 2014 and 2015 Centcom created a very close process for the evaluation of information on IS and Iraq's security forces," said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “breathed the results of intelligence services,” he damaged the morale of analysts and “did not take sufficiently into account dissenting views.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats argue that they have not found any evidence that the White House would try to push the Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions according to "the model or the political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported an ongoing investigation into the general inspector of the Pentagon, which began after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Commander-in-chief Patrick Evans, spokesperson of the Pentagon, stated in his statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the parliamentary report because the investigation of the general inspector is still ongoing.
However, he stated that "experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security."
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is a success (the verdict that now declares an increasing number of defence representatives).
However, last year's accusations raised questions as to how much President Obama can rely on the central staff to sincerely evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The intelligence criticism of the Islamic State has been reflecting conflicts for more than ten years, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that despite public statements of opposition, air strikes against the refineries of the Islamic State did not significantly weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group because the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not passed off to the central staff.
Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism the past year after many legislators found the Senate's testimony too positive by evaluating the war.
General Austin resigned in April and replaced General Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
The U.S. won a ground hockey game in the fourth game in a row, so today's gonna be a crucial game in the UK team.
Katie Bam scored three goals in a six-to-one match against Japan, and just a day later, for the American female field hockey team, she scored the first two goals of the match, in which on Thursday America defeated India 3:0.
Five goals in two games is a good success to remember, but Bam (27) said she was not sure if she ever did.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those who writes down their goals.
But this is what he knows: the Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to 4:0 games and share the first place in the group with the UK, which remained undefeated on Thursday after the defeat of Japan at 2:0.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals, and the match decides who from the six teams will end up in the first and second place.
The team from first place will be a little longer avoided by the strong Danes who are at the forefront of the second group.
Whatever the end of the Saturday game, the Americans have brought about their surprise ride here, four years after they ended up among the 12 teams in the games in London.
Bam was on the team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took the hockey stick for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twins played in Drexel) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make it to the final roster.
Then came 2012 when neither she nor her team members were successful.
The following year was coached by Englishman Craig Parnham and things started to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the tempo of work in London as we do today.
We made a complete turn.
On Thursday night Bam started in the first half by shooting the goal bekendem from nearby.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team turned out to be surprisingly hard and kept the score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left-hand side of the playing field, then she clicks into the middle and shoots the ball into the goal to get the American woman in charge at 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American goalie, Jackie Briggs, who in each of the three victories helped one goal, was the first ever at the tournament.
She's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"Now we are in a good place," said Parnham, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic frenzy
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro make you feel persistent, indescribable and biased in the rotation of competition and effort.
It's how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay pin that comes from the archer swimmers, gymnasts, and triathlons.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbor's interview in the coffee line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the innocuousness between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the coming darling of women with dolls in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will ring in households in the main broadcast time between advertising and sponsor spots if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympic fire doesn't light all the competitions the same.
Far from the center, a bit in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting air pistols, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always succeed in the classic swimming style - and will probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my special favorite, let me draw attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
Although jumping on the trampoline is an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first shown in Sydney games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport has remained almost unnoticed - many of the people I asked about did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. never won a medal in the trampoline jumps, and until 2012 none of the athletes even made it to the finals.
The prices in the male category are usually shared between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be presented by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But the jumps on the trampoline have another bad luck, partly because the ear of the uninvited will seem more suitable for the clown university than for the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just an enthusiast watching from the country.
It has comical potential - comical vibrations of infinite reflection - but also the ability of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline", meaning "jumpboard."
Aspirating champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them to a height of almost 10 meters and perform sets with several elements (salts, crows and combinations) before they finally land again on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to implementation, difficulty and "times in the air".
In Rio there will be 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic runway is forward.
The warriors of the gold medal must move on, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They try to catch up not only with the target tape or the starting wall, but, as the TV news reports, also with a different line of thought: the world record or the Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and sufficient to bring tears to the audience.
But I think it's a little exhausting at the same time when you're watching the Olympics.
Jumping on the trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The track of the athletes on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not moving forward.
He or she reflects, as if they were in a condition without weights like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
There is no competition and, of course, no difficulty, but for the duration of the compilation there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no measuring distance, but only a perfect, nice tension of time and gravity.
This is the closest to the Olympics and Zen.
The women's qualification and finals take place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock Eastern time, male competition then on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will broadcast the finals within the afternoon block, which starts after both days at 14 o'clock.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise a peaceful, pleasant moment that you will probably miss through the other battles.
And if the attention is to be achieved only by the fact that men's athletes will be the subject of in love and materialization - as the US gymnasts recently proposed according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch their breath.
"Protesting Generation" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants demanding political change in Ethiopia have encountered a violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say a lot of protesters were shot in clashes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has experienced anti-government unrest that is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses say the cops shot and killed a bunch of unarmed demonstrators.
On the collapsing videos of protests that probably come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, members of the security forces are captured as beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand by the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and take a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, Head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second largest nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the dangers of a terrorist attack in the area, particularly in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, are getting such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - in the capital of Addis Ababa there is even a new suburban train.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - organisations fighting for human rights without ceasing talking about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been banished, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But that can change.
"When you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break," said Seyoum Teshome, who teaches at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the youth.
He's protesting for generations.
There are many complaints, and they concern everything from soil disputes to absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
Following last year's elections, which were widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies gained the last chair held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in Parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border is increasing with Eritrea. Conflict along this vaguely marked, disputed border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, which have been more or less suppressed over the past few years, such as the Orom Liberation Front or the Ogadena National Liberation Front, may attempt to exploit confusion and rearm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, after years of smelting under the surface, these bitter feelings have become inflamed again.
The first is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks for up to a few years, when they have become commonly available cheaper smartphones and the provision of internet services has improved.
And even if the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through the Internet proxy that hides the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered for protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between Oroma and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amharites, mostly from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, have excelled in politics and trade and used Oromas, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
“We are on our way to a united leadership,” said Mulata Gemmacha, Orom leader.
The biggest protests occurred in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrai ethnicist, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of the riot is the death of Meles Zenavi.
Zenavi, former insurgent leader, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he was subjected to an unsustainable disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly capable of revealing the initial signals of dissatisfaction and using the ambassadors to process the opponents and get them on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative ignorance to replace Zenavi.
Unlike Zenavi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam came from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security service controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such riots in 2005 after thousands of people protested what analysts called the elections that the government then stole.
There was a hard intervention, during which many protesters were killed - although less than in the past months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts appreciated Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
Of course, it is clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there's a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, Ammar, attacked businesses owned by the Tigreans and hatred against the Tigreians on social networks became more and more common.
Analysts say that protests put the US and other Western allies in an uncomfortable position.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over neighbouring Somalia, although it has recently declared that the base has been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, at the same time it does not want its ally to fall apart in such an unstable area.
"This," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to ignore the latest controversy that flooded his campaign by saying that he did not mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the Islamic State's terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to speak clearly with the American public.
They also put his supporters in an uncomfortable situation, who tried hard to defend him in a stormy time and must explain that he might not have taken his remarks seriously.
After this motion for a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed his statement on Thursday, and in the interviews he insisted that he did not really intend to say that the President and H. Clinton IS were created.
However, in a Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump stated that he was only sarcastic.
The paper was the opposite of an old statement just one day when Trump said in several interviews that his accusations on the contrary were serious.
When the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump reduce the remark by reminding Obama that he was trying to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes when Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy while his preferences in election surveys fall.
Trump and Clinton participated this week in the Michigan duel on economic issues.
On Friday Trump tried to return to this topic again.
On Twitter, he warned again that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, and he said that according to some, her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm defense before.
At the end of July, when he collected a wave of criticism, when he proposed that the Russians should break into Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his point: "I am, of course, sarcastic."
This approach enables Trump to push the boundaries of political declarations and to moderate them as necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing to what extent some reports have a response to his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction one or another,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that he is skillful in his statements and knows that they are sufficiently vague to be explained in different ways.
Since the results of the election surveys continue to drop in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more splinter tone in the last few days, rather than quenching things for the general voters.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close behind it in Florida.
Trump is even trying to avoid apologies for provocative statements he says, but he often accuses his criticisms of misinterpretation of his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But with Trump facing increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put the unpleasant situation of his loyal supporters, who must stand behind him publicly, however provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate in the interview for CNN on Thursday.
"I believe that what he is saying is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani when he was questioned about Trump's credibility as to the fact that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, the IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he was calling a rookie completely wrong, and it happened because he withdrawn his troops from Iraq.
Most common Republicans are trying to argue that Obama's government, in which Clinton acted as a foreign minister, allowed IS to flow and not handle the situation aggressively in the Middle East.
Before the Friday meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter around him, he put fire on the media for overthinking every word of it and for being interested in it.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” television scholars who tried to understand him, and he said: “They can’t do that! ”
Several of the Democrats have made an apology for Trump's lack of confidence that it's just another proof that he's not qualified for the presidential office.
The cafe has pushed prices out of the market. Now it returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shoddy place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash without Wi-Fi, but where the coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a shop that RGB replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
The locals cried like the last loss of a growing city.
"New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is flattened and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe, which is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
In Verb began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay him to move to a new place, he said he'd do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bread supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even re-used the old verbu lighting.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
There are ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings like capers and fried onions.
You'll also find brown rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed the constant influx of the original stamgasts.
"A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of prices," he said.
There was one of these customers last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to the Verb Cafe often.
Even then, the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that after he shut down, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verb," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, but on that day she put mixed chai instead of her usual iced coffee, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
He goes before work and orders the same thing.
"In a quarter and eight every day, like a watch, I come here, and they're preparing for me my bagel with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the offer.
Mr Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he has bacon, eggs and ham on his bucket.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap forVerb and to use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also accepted the cafe well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said that he wanted to find a place where he'd soon put it to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
A local fruit juice producer wants to turn into bottles and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility for the cafe to spread to a neighbouring building.
A lot of customers just got their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says when the coffee shop opened again, walk in and have coffee, it's like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
A depressed meal from a time of crisis - in “Square Meal”
Shortly after joining the President's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
The swan president Roosevelt enjoyed the selected 5th avenue dishes, such as the goose liver pate and the Mariland turtle soup.
His menu for this day was more modest: eggs on the devilish way in a paradise sauce, potato puree and as dessert plum pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to the Americans how to eat. ”
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights is dedicated to gastronomic history.
The last book by Andrew Coe “Chop Suey” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book “97 Orchard” tells the life story of a dwelling on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work, "A Square Meal", published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They have shown their own cooking solidarity and have met with the reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg sandwich shop, a small high-strength buffet in Flatiron, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which according to the couple was excellently suited to the conversation about food during the crisis.
"Carbanettes were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
Selling peanut, liver and bean meatball.
They were made from the ingredients and other cheap foods that set the ingredients.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe slipped.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a buffet to eat what you eat.
Women's teams were cooking for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch, and dinner were served freshly baked pie.
They were Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" observes the way the nation dealt with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe explained why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as feared: mysterious foods have spread, such as carbs and casserole dishes, castroples as “a wonderful way to use the residue,” said Ziegelmanová, because the cooks could hide the non-aesthetic ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
After many years, the meat - the central point of American food - has become a cost-efficient luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were intended to serve as caloric and nutritional supplements, were preferable to taste or even to common sense when cooking.
During the surveys for a book containing recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a daily meal made of roasted onion filled with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the evening table," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter with baked onion doesn't come together.
It was typical of a lot of homemade recipes.
Like never before, and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the sword of the Federal Office for the Home Economy between 1923 and 1943 - managed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take over the reins of the budget, and slags such as cream spaghetti with carrots converted into tasty foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
First of all, desserts were created in the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's pose "I'll have a pie".
While publicly praising the simple Iowan farm kitchen of his childhood, he served as the chosen millionaire he had become.
"The joy ate continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him an example of his own stomach.
As the book says, Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all, and this led to the White House being “not only served almost the most beautiful food in all of Washington, but also in the most unpleasant way prepared.”
Many of the times of crisis’s dining habits were resolved as soon as the country had re-established its feet.
The reference remains in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they understood Miss Ziegelman's mother's eating habits better, maybe why she couldn't throw out the food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled: “The people were wrong about her. ”
There's been an accident with wreaths.
When Eisenberg's tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled a dessert that they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly threw a spoon into a thick brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a proper host, he told his wife: “A bit of meatloaf would be good. ”
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most refugees who are rolling into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
That's what TV shows would look like if we did them.
A group of Russian artists, called 2D Among Us, make fun of their home country.
Using photoshops, they create collages that funnyly show what it would look like if famous shows and movies were filming in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to a legal representation charge in the case of a patent against hepatitis C against Merck
The Judge of the District Court held that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to pay the fees for lawyers which it had incurred in the process of patenting against hepatitis C against manufacturers of medicines from Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment that Gilead was to pay 200 million for damages due to the breach of two Merck patents in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge had repeatedly found illegal acts on the side of Merck, among other things a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal judge Beth Labson Freeman on a case-file on Thursday stated that Gilead was entitled to acquittal of charges arising from representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for new generation anti-yellowing C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active component of Gilead medicines.
The Americans supported by military troops claim to have full control over Manbij City
The military forces supported by the US gained full control of the northern city of Manbíj near the border with Turkey after the last fighters of the Islamic State fled the city, said the spokesperson of the group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Force (SDF) now sweeps the city after leaving the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city.
The troops freed over 2,000 civilians who had been detained by the radicals, told Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and Manbije military council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it," he told Reuters.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return on Friday, stating that the presidential candidate for the Democrats and her husband had a $10.75 million revenue in a given year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
The Clinton Foundation (Clinton Foundation) spent $1 million on charity in 2015. The ex-President Bill Clinton contributed almost $5.3 million to the joint cash register, and the former Foreign Secretary admitted $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on its operation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's co-designate, U.S. Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published a tax return in 10 years.
They paid a real tax of 20,3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine remain a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped the Clintons campaign.
In contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws from his earlier promises to release his tax return.
It is customary that U.S. Presidential candidates publish their tax returns even if the law does not impose them.
Trump, a businessman in New York, and his lawyers quoted the US Treasury Department's tax audit as a reason for refusing to publish the tax return.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's Twitter sidekick, and he followed up on the democratic candidate's tax return.
Michael Cohen, special advisor to Trump, said on Thursday CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax return until the audits were completed.
According to Trump’s critics, among whom the Republican candidate for president of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, trade transactions and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has a strong performance on the issue and published a video on Friday, in which she recalls the high status of Republicans on Trumpa urges him to publish his tax return.
On Thursday, I will mention my speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all other presidential candidates have been doing for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said in front of people.
Politico stated that Trump had paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim to be, this can be the case at present.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the President.
Clinton is promoting a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that all who make more than $1 million a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton Assembly in Omaza, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also went through the IRS audit and that Trump was "not afraid" of the Financial Office, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign published a tax return back to 2007.
On average, between 2007 and 2014, Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid a federal tax of 32 percent on average and a combined tax of around 40,5 percent.
According to Clinton's 2015 tax return, unlike most Americans, their income is only $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons reported income on dividends and interest of $109 000.

Condoms filled with chilli or elephant protection fireworks in Tanzania
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to human homes - they throw condoms at them filled with chilli powder.
This process has proven itself and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to protect their homes and crops by using this nonviolent procedure in four steps without harming animals.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves earlier.
Friday is a world elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they developed this... set of tools, we have seen a change of behavior in these communities. People have much more faith that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said the executive director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Foundation in the statement.
The first and second step is to turn the flashlight on the passing elephant and start the horn.
If he is not discouraged, the so-called “chilli pale” will be thrown away.
Chilli powder mixed with salt and a firecracker wraps into a condom, the end of which is sealed so that only wicks can be seen from it.
After the blast, the condom explodes and the fine chilli powder is scattered into the air.
Most of the time, it takes one breath, and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to set off a fireworks that causes a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned on the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel to "request" the Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin sparked a riot in the media after finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have the code given for calling to Israel, according to the employee’s words on the basis of the “requirement” of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of a documentary on the Holocaust "Shoah", vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel call code list.
However, the state has not been mentioned among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 Israel was removed and deleted in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility to call to Israel via its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel reception with the problem.
According to his words, Lanzmann “shocked” the answer he received.
The hotel worker replied that the measure was “decided after considering the management of Kempinski Hotels.”
The reason for this step of the director was even more intimidating.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they have requested that the call code of Israel be deleted,” quoted Lanzmann’s employees in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the ambassador of Israel in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case “a great shame”.
We were horrified and shocked by the events.
It's a huge shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain is even more a disgrace.
There's no need for further explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event triggered a strong response online, people calling it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel has simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
“Hanba to you,” says another article, which points out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street, is near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any charges by referring to the event as a "oversight" and to Lanzman "sorry".
“Never a direct order has been issued” not to include Israel in the call code list, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung Hotel representative Kempinski.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber projects against protesting Brazilian students
Students and police clash took place in San Paulo, Brazil on Thursday, when students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police against protesters used tear gas and rubber projectors.
The problem escalated when government service tried to get the students started, which ended with the police using rubber projectors and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the Governor of the State of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin to save money is the closure of nearly hundreds of public schools and the relocation of 300 000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration could be seen spraying inscriptions against temporary President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators made their way to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, when the Senate in the country decided to charge her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan has increased trade turnover by 70.9 percent since the abolition of the sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies are renewing their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached the level of $856 million.
In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
Jumping increase in trade has ensured the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Over the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued around 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly to travel.
In addition, Iran first entered the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It can be safely said that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia will be overcome last year," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scot Callum Skinner hastens home after the British have won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodro in Rio, when the VB team's trio defended the title from London 2012.
A 23 - year - old native from Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took as his Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and a young legend was pleased when he hit the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of a favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after the modest sixth at the World Championship in March, even though Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for the specialist opening racer Jamie Staff.
Hindes then appeared just in time.
After Hoye left, a place was released that tried to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British trainers and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was together with Hoy the champion four years ago - and with Skinner reached the Olympic record during the qualification, but the shirt took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British Trio got gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind the wheel after his round, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner maintained the lead.
The change in strategy was a major part of the transformation when Hintes went on a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep up.
Hoy was following the BBC commentator from his position, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hintes stepped out on stage, he did not let his eyes out.
A 23 - year - old Skinner, a native from Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison. ”
I'm here to get the best of myself and make an honorable name for myself.
We made an Olympic record in the finals, and we beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After his triumph next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hintes admitted that he had fallen on the track on purpose after a weak start.
He later withdrawn the note and the competitors of Britain had no chance to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said: “With all those British flags on the stands, I felt like I was in London. ”
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We've lost many of the world's races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is supposed to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we have five successful days waiting for us at the Velodram.
With the form that Kenny showed, it is not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
This would then be for Kenny - which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, it also has a birthday on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred for British sports, on this day also celebrates Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a total of six gold medals and one silver medal.
Same as Hoy's.
Next, Kenny will take part in a sprint that starts today and lasts another three days.
An 18 - year - old from Bolton said: “Now I enjoy this one.
Team race is always the best.
You win along with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “When he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knight title. ”
That was the only medal race that day, but Britain was expecting more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest teams to compete for a four-mile race.
They're done with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (22:42) take place today on the second day of the race, which will certainly be targeted by Wiggins.
Yesterday, before the qualification race, he debated with the Commissioners when the referees invited him to measure his height.
In a similar race of women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavia reached the world record with time 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong team of cycling and mastered the middle period of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, proving absolute superiority in Beijing and London, Rio’s expectations decreased during the preparations for Rio.
The background was followed by dramatic events, not least the resignation of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April for sexism and discrimination charges, and the termination of a career of greats like Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as demonstrated by the first night of the Velodrom races, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver a top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of a factory in Portland after the end of the contract for the supply of energy
The future of the Portland aluminum factory in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of a power plant that supplies electricity and informs one of its owners of the plan to terminate the electricity supply contract. It is expected that all the electricity supply contracts will be shortened.
This step follows the previous decision by the government of Victoria that this year will not extend the supply of subsidies maintained by the company.
The fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk in Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk when closing.
And since the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be other avalanche effects.
Alcoa closed Point Henry's factory in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglesee plant last year.
Alcoa’s factory in Portland is prolific and is threatened with closure.
This is followed by several years of speculation on the future of the company, originally in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to prices for production of the plant.
AGL, a large aluminium factory supplying electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expected that one of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is the joint venture of Alcoa and Aluminum, with small business shares held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the positive demand for electricity from the factory will continue,” she said.
AGL stated that the contracts were so-called ‘insurance contracts’, which were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of notice, so that they will actually expire in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for the fiscal year 2017’, said the power plant.
Any possible impact on AGL's profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to a strong outlook on the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already drawn up the value of the contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million “in case of termination.”
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract ‘has no impact on its ability to operate the melting plant or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant’.
The American company stated that in 2010 it entered into a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, which was due to start in November this year, although it still has to explain why it had to withdraw from the contract.
Analysts are very careful about the possible closure of the Portland factory in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle as a result of the weak economy in the sector.
The head of operation of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who at the beginning of this week turned to analysts, said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in market demand [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a producer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian real estate show - now the envelope of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), the model and fourth daughter of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan mother-wife, appeared on the front page of the September edition of the American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, Ambassador to Estee Lauder, who showed up for a fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday in her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page," Kendall wrote.
The opening of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply continuing humorous performance by the Kardashians?) staged video, in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (rob and Caitly barbers and along with them all favorite uncles from show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest).
It's a played storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of a children's TV show (Seecrest says: "Did you think we forgot you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o'clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure that the other girls in this publication were able to feed.
Because when we look at the Vogue magazine's September issue, we definitely entered the new era of the Kardashians.
The older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall to cover Vogue (she was there together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September issue of the magazine is another league.
The September edition of Vogue magazine is the most sold number of the year.
The publication, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts many advertisers (Fashionist calculated that on 832 pages in last year's edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star, which appears on the front page, is eagerly expected, so it is no wonder that in the past two years the pictures of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the title page has certainly appeared more "celebrits that make models" than "models that are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar's owner and Ambassador to Dior, appeared on the headline in 2013, a year later Lagy Gaga had the honour.
But even though it is very unlikely that Kendall - whom the magazine describes as the "half-model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, will be in a very good society.
These celebrities are not related to known people, nor to real estate shows stars, or to children of today who know how to make a well-cut video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are proven talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career due to the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original model Victoria's Secret, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadida in June and called them "the girls of the moment".
These feelings were rekindled with news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner's on the cover of September Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's doing a show for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you images of themselves on their own payals.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who took pictures of her for Love magazine.
And in her spare moments, she's on a reality show, maybe just one way to see Kourtney and her kids.
The Community legal aid centres will reject 160 000 people a year
More than 160 000 most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in community legal aid centres, and in the sector they are preparing for the effects that will have further constraints on over-expensive services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, endangered workers, victims of violence and people without funds to fight against unfair eviction and the like - are being rejected as soon as they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to burst, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 percent of federal finance.
The Head of Community Legal Assistance Centres in Queenslad James Farrell said that, according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community Legal Assistance Centres, 5,000 people were rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without the federal government's decision to cancel, the situation would be deteriorating.
"Community legal assistance centres in Queensland are chronically subfinanced, which means that thousands of people are rejected by the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from their relations with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly released - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 percent, leading to thousands of other threatened people from Queensland having to focus on complex legal problems without aid.
We call on the U.S. Attorney and Senator George Brandis to prevent this shortening of finance immediately, so that people get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government has fulfilled its commitment to ensuring the financing of legal aid up to the level of the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centres and the community of their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
A lawsuit for Donald Trump's campaign after a member of the crew allegedly pointed a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was filed for alleged inaction after being informed that the head of operations in North Carolina in February aimed a gun at a member of the crew during a jeep ride.
The incident was described in a court case file that was handed over by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer in the state on Wednesday at the Court of State in Charlotte.
Bordini said that he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that "it would not happen".
Director Earl Phillip “marked his fingers with a gun, put a real trigger finger on the trigger and pointed the barrel at Vincent’s head,” Bordini reported in the lawsuit.
The file states that after a complaint with the local and regional campaign management, Bordini discovered that at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip.
"Weapons need not be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate provoked an upheaval when he told the voters in North Carolina that the owners and holders of the weapons could intervene (which is regulated in the second amendment of the Constitution in the US) if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and would be able to appoint her judge.
Trump's campaign says the media pulled his words out of context and that Trump wasn't defending violence.
Bordini, in the action, is asking for compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and from Phillip for the danger of personal security, the unlawful use of violence and the cause of emotional harm.
Trump's spokesperson Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the request for comment.
The attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news office in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
His phone call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was not responding within a short period of time.
Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is conducting a controversial election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of restoration and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is extremely attractive, just like London 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefit from the Olympic Games.
Olympic games meant huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities will we create 10,000 new teaching places, 40 000 new jobs, and end the unemployment of young people in the vicinity of the airport.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, there are also those who will think that the Heathrow enlargement is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would laugh at the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the Heathrow case, it turns out they weren't right.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The enlargement is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of £ 211 billion, to leave the heritage in the form of skills and employment both in the vicinity of the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which, in due course and budget, introduced an investment program for £11 billion in infrastructure, starting with Terminal T5 - which was chosen by the world's best terminal for five years in a row, after Terminal T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they're ready to deliver a third runway worth £16 billion of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 have been a huge success of Great Britain and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be it too.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and spread Heathrow, secure trade in the future, and leave behind the heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Director for Trade Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in game on cat and mouse in blocking ads
From attempts to bypass advertising blocking programs, for companies that make money on online marketing, the game became a cat and mouse. At least that is claimed by one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block the advertising filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a post on its website stating that users can update the filters in their program and re-block the ad on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that his desktop website will change coding around ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But now Adblock claims that the new codes have already been circumvented.
Adblock's spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of war between the open source community blocking ads and those who try to bypass them has been going on since the blocking ads were invented," and that Facebook is likely to come up with another self-repair.
The fact that a society that owns the largest social network in the world has been involved in the war only proves the great problem of blocking advertising for industry.
According to the study, Pagefair and Adobe conducted worldwide advertising filters for about 200 million people last year - almost four times as much as they did in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of Facebook advertising profits, and every day Facebook visits 1.03 billion active users from mobile devices.
The spokesperson said, however, that the company is opposed to advertising filters on the desktop, because mobile advertising filters on mobile apps for social networks and Instagram are not working.
Advertising on your desktop still represents a profit high enough to make Facebook decide to invest in it.
Facebook also stated on Tuesday that it would update the “ad preferences” tool to give people the opportunity to better control how they are displayed to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said that the new Adblock filters were disturbing them, as they could also block content that is unrelated to advertising.
“This is not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to solve this problem,” said Facebook spokesperson in an email statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, and that's why we've rather focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman was hit by a Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses to an event in which on Thursday morning several cars were run over by a woman who probably tried to commit suicide.
An accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The police in Vaud stated in a statement that the actor of the “desperate act” was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
Clearly, the victim, a woman of 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the scene.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but police say they haven't all been identified yet.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said the attorney Gilles Hofstetter for Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the interested drivers will face any accusations.
Was there any way to stop the impact?
This is what the prosecutor needs to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases of the past five years, it seems that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspapers stated.
Last year, the police officer was deprived of the murder charge for negligence after she hit and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne in the night of August 2014.
The court reported that the victim was drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and fainted on the road.
The court found that a police officer - who responded to an emergency call - was driving in an appropriate manner and that the presence of a man on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information on the Thursday incident with Morges should report to the police on telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerable city.
Prague is a popular destination of the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague within Prague Pride.
The Executive Director of AČCKA Kateřina Petříčková informed on Friday.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8th, the festival brings the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
About 35,000 people attended the event last year.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialised businesses," said Petříčková.
According to a survey of organizers, foreign visitors spend CZK 3100 per person on average per day.
Gay tourists are in support of their travel available special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, it is interested in higher price periods with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petříčková said.
This year's first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held as part of the programme of the festival.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14th.
The main theme this year is love, but the action will also focus on several thematic areas: family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The top of the festival will be a traditional parade on Saturday with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
The tour, attended by thousands of people in recent years, will honor this year's minute of silence the memory of the victims of the June attack at the Orlando nightclub, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat have been celebrating forty years.
The irresistible kutilites Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have been entertaining small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening's series of director Lubomír Benes premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, now known by viewers in more than a hundred countries, there were cartoon jokes by the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who invented for a magazine with two masters Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Benes then invited the dramaturgist Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimír Jiránek to work together and made the film Kuťák.
Today's form with a yellow and red trick and a ball and radio was given to characters in 1979, when in Short Film Prague began to create a series for Slovak TV.
The names Pat and Mat were then received in 1985, this time it was made directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of whom were attended by the son of Benes Marek.
There are now over ninety episodes with stories of these kutilites, with which everything falls under their hands, but they are never angry at each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and kutilish enthusiasm and, in the end, they are satisfied with their work, as demonstrated by the famous gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theatres and characters and other toys with the image of Pat and Mata are the hit of every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we chose for you one sport and one of your lives.
They both have a good ending.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend, and she's happy with her.
And what are the things people spend most on at airports?
It's a Friday review of the world's websites.
The first medal from the Olympic Games.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's selection of this archipelago defeated the team of Great Britain in the finale of the Olympic tournament of the seven-piece rugby.
It's actually the first medal Fiji ever won for herself at the Olympics.
Waiting for the profit of the first precious metal took 60 years to send the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
Coach Fiji is very successful.
But it's ironic that it's Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been in charge since 2013 and, after the finals, the British citizen could be satisfied, unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can do the biggest game in our history," said the coach before the finals.
Fiji finally took over, and a small state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The report was brought by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who's been living without her hands and feet for 11 months, got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," a two-year-old girl rejoiced as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter liked to take off her hands and legs and then sit together with no prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with meningitis type B in less than one year of life, and doctors gave her only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He's got perspective.
I saw her introduce herself to other kids with words Hi, I'm Harmonie, and I don't have hands, my mother added.
Look at the joy of the doll.
What do we spend most on at the airport?
CNN brings the discovery that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
Hudson's travel essential stores has published data for the last year, which summarizes 10 products that customers at their airport shops most often buy.
The water was sovereign first.
Drinks were generally very popular, eight in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large package of M&M chocolates with coconut flavor.
And can you guess who's closing the top ten?
One of the things you can't eat is the only thing you can't eat.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We're just gonna win, Murray and Bond laughed.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have sovereignly reigned the category of doubles without the helm for seven years and confirmed their dominance in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the incoherent couple moved on to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing competition since 2009.
At Rodriga de Freitas lagoon, they scored 69th in a row in the Thursday finale.
What are we different from the others in?
We're just prettier, Murray was joking during the Olympic regatta when he was supposed to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different than the others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we are constantly trying to improve our technique, this is our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their domination is remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is an almost two-footer and a hundred-footer, academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they have a different nature.
Bond is studying and dedicated to finance, Murray has, for example, a charity boxing match.
Even because of that, he doesn't spend much time out of rowing.
Eric's getting on the boat, basically, with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, Bond admitted, who also demonstrated at the press conference that Murray was the dominant in the crew.
He was the one who always answered first, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, he destroys his opponent with a calm force.
They are moving their pace, and although they are often not at the forefront of the track, the opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We're racing on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first kilometer over.
We're just trying to take the pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said 44-year-old Murray.
With his four years younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Cup.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the golden four without the steering wheel.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to move on to the two without the steering wheel.
At the London Olympics, they probably had the biggest defeat of their careers, and the dominance confirmed in Rio too.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask questions.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was gonna be a hell of a lot, and we had to make sure we were doing it mentally well, said Murray.
We all know that they want to overthrow us from the throne.
We still have the target on our backs.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a resident
According to projections of NASA's new climate model, Venus was once inhabited.
The scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model for studying Venus using instruments and algorithms similar to those used by climate study scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether, once on Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water and saturated CO2 could have been conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of Venus' rotation can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus once seemed to be proud of a thin atmosphere similar to the Earth while turning slowly.
The model also dealt with the previous topography of Venus.
On the planet, the areas were probably dryer than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus had previously used the sun, which was 30 percent less.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during a slow rotation, it exposes its daily side to the sun almost two months at once," explained the scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
Thus, the surface is heated and the rain is generated, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which behave as an umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures, which are actually slightly lower than on Earth at present.
The model built the story of Venus, similar to the evolution previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Even though Venus was probably resident in the past -- over a few billion years -- she was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans evaporated and the water vapours were burned with ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen has escaped and only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned from the post of team coach Colorado Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned for his post as coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey operations, as a reason he stated the inability to participate in the decision-making process on team issues.
The Executive Vice President/General Manager Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the step and stated that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have been acting as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
I spent a long and intense period of summer thinking about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the coach and vice president of hockey operations comply with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roye on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his team's contributions.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to a profit of 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. Colorado was struggling with Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and in the last two years he had always failed to fight after the season.
The Avalanche team in 2015/2016 scored 39:39:4 and missed five points to win the second wild card in the Western Conference.
The goalie Roy, who signed up for the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Oil platform workers in the North Sea renew conversations and interrupt strike
The leaders of the negotiating parties indicated that the strikes for the wages of oil platform workers in the North Sea were interrupted while all the parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
The attacks against the Wood Group's oil field service company occasionally occurred on the North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
‘Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions may confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for resolving current disagreements,’ is stated in the statement.
Starting next week, we will have a number of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to the trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is to protest against wage cuts by up to 30 percent.
Wood Group reduced its tariffs this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company's rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would provide space for companies to cope with a market decline.
On the other hand, Shell cut thousands of people out of his payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries for the modernisation of his processes - immediately after the mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June decision of Britain to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of the parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders to discuss one of the greatest working disagreements of the whole generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as it said, is vital for the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and all over the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just for some," he said.
For comparison, in 2016, almost $1.4 billion of investments in new projects in the North Sea are expected, while the average over the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in Pleiades
The latest Kepler's Space Telescope mission to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of the speeds of star rotation from the Pleiade constellation.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the constellation rotate at different speeds, and how the time of rotation is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star matter, its age and even the history in its solar system," said Luisa Rebullová, a researcher in the centre of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
Starship Pleiades is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and have been formed for over 125 million years.
Now it's turning the fastest.
At moments of maximum speed, these teenage stars release huge amounts of star wind.
Because these winds move along magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
With the star getting old, its speed of rotation slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of distinguishable points on the stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on speeds of rotation, larger stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebulla compares the stars to the dancers, makes the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
“In the “ballet” of Pleiades we see that slower turning stars are more massive, while those that spin the fastest are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Since the constellation Pleiades is so close, they serve as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
"The Pleiades provide us with anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, for younger and older stars," Rebullová said.
There's still a lot we want to learn about how, when and why the stars slow down their speed of rotation, and so they say, "Hold their dance shoes on a nail."
Rebulla and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of Pleiades rotation rate in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I hadn't signed up, then the qualification agreement wouldn't have been concluded, and after a few months I could have gone to another hospital?
Is it possible to work without enrollment in specialization education after admission?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is only a somewhat more distant hospital now, but in about six months, there could be a seat at another place where I would like to work.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation for about six months, so the question goes on.
Answers Mgr. Lenka Wolf.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - hospitals.
The qualification agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the reimbursement of incurred costs associated with the increase or deepening of the staff member’s qualifications.
In the field of health, long-term pressure is being put on the failure to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the mobility of health professionals and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for the acquisition and recognition of professional qualifications and specialised qualifications for the exercise of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is expressly understood that participation in specialisation training is to be considered to be an increase in qualifications (not an increase).
This means that the qualification agreement can be concluded under the Labour Code only if the costs are at least CZK 75 000.
No legislation or obligation to apply for specialisation education.
The law merely lays down the conditions for the application for specialisation education.
According to the law, however, a doctor is entitled to pursue a doctor’s profession because of the necessary university studies, even if under statutory conditions (under the supervision of a doctor with specialised competence in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation where specialist experience completed in another field of specialisation may be included in the doctor's specialisation training if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
In theory, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the questioner’s situation.
