The great return of the Czech loser is coming.
Paul French was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel French, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A 33 - year - old Plzeň native will be on the grid, and he could soon get into the goal.
Former goaltender Litvínov, Pilsen or Russian Čeljabinsko got hurt in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He was in the middle of a game with Vegas, and he hasn't been introduced to the NHL's rinks since.
The incident occurred when an experienced goalie moved from one stick to another.
“Pavel French will be out of the way for about three to four weeks with an injury in the lower part of the body,” he announced the whole of Denver at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goal eventually extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning the American time was called from a farm where he captured four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL, 94.5% of the procedures were taken.
The breeder of Plzeňského hockey wants to finally enforce and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year, he had problems with his hips and did not catch a single match in the short pandemic year.
In the NHL “France” caught 36 games, his success rate is 92.3%.
Charles is putting on Camille's Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
As this year's Christmas wish, British prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their journey to Jordan.
He also published his wish to Prince Charles, who used a photograph in which his wife Camille helps to put on the dress at the races.
The BBC news station informed on its website.
They send their wish to their friends, to their associates, and to the foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and the dress is also made by Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, wears like Prince George and Louis, shorts and a shirt with a collar.
Whoever took the photograph, William and Kate didn't mention it, it's not even clear when exactly it was created.
Last year, the royal family for a photograph designed as a Christmas wish posed on a package of straw in front of a pile of wood in its rural residence in Norfolk County.
The photo, which serves as a Christmas wish, was also published by Prince Charles’ successor to the throne with his wife Camille.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught them in June at the Ascot races.
Charles, who has a cylinder on her head and on her face, helps Camille to put on her dress in color with bright clothes.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbra a million for the title, the Hardman denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former Vice-President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr was to have a promised million crowns for the league title in the season 2018/19.
He informed the server efotbal.cz about it, saying he got to some of the police files.
The chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice club Jaroslav Dětík stated that they did not commit any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia mainly features its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up in the championship club last summer.
According to the case file, the former influential Red and White Officer was in frequent contact with both Berbra and former sports director at the time, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused.
The criminals reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbra had promised a financial reward for getting the title.
2019 team SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) from SK Slavia Praha, a promised million-dollar bribe, quoted the server from the file as winning in the league.
A day later, according to the CSI, Berbr met not only with Nezmar but also with the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Slavie Hardík.
According to the server, the file no longer shows whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The hard man refused any corruption.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposite alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, we have not sought to influence the referees in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial fulfillment in this context," said the report list.
In listening to, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some of the former players of Slavia's dark skin and also slanders his former boss Hardy.
Last mid-October, police intervention in several places, including the Prague seat of the FAČR, launched a case of alleged influence of matches through referees.
Berbr is the highest in the field, which no longer stands in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, just like former sports director Vyšehrad Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
The cannons will be new, but basically worse type (the gunmen have to carry the shells manually without covering from the armored cab).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition they managed to get rid of Prague V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - little and only small types without fighting potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I've got a chase right next to town.
From the river they climbed the Nutria and did damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that there was a fisherman on the riverbank.
I didn't want to be a mess, so I sat still, and I don't think the guy noticed me.
I was hoping she'd leave before something came up, but of course, the fox was leaving in a minute.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
Poor fisherman almost fucked up, waved his forehead all over the place, so I called him it was for the fox.
He was gone before I got off the stand.
I mean, the meadow can be a piece of shit.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a match of a lot of coincidences to make something happen, you'd probably see yourself in a thermovision that everyone has today.
So, in a visible place, expensive things go to your feet in a sleeping bag, and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The interior got respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of drapes, masks and respirators for the profession closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRady server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts per respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities have behaved economically?
And why did the others buy the runway?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to the server editor, iRobloka Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate the soldiers and the army (I don't think I'm affected by the memories of the Czech Republic, which have experienced older generations), but the Czech Republic can't benefit from the compulsory war.
We don't even have large warehouses of techniques that can be captured, we don't actually have modern technology for existing professionals, and modern technology is becoming more complex, so the ability of the depositors will be rapidly wasting their time.
Modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can put them on, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
Finally, depositors/territorial defences are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrilla can be led and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic there will be only a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the gerilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have the right geography for it.
We don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is, half of them play like they do.
Then there's a situation where you look like a loser who hasn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago, he's coming into an attack alone between two or even three Swiss, and you're saying, "twitter, and what do you think's gonna happen now?"
Well, of course they're gonna take him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to get a defenseman" is so terrible, I caught myself honestly surprised to see that our assailant was able to play one of his opponents.
First traps
Covid's pandemic is slowing down, but experts don't expect a major turnover for the next few weeks.
The influx in hospitals according to statistical models lasts for some time, and the new unknown has added to the pandemic equation: a variant of omicrons, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired by previous illness can help against it.
But this week, the unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new medicine, antivirotic mollupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by a paxlovid drug from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of up to 85 percent.
However, the first delivery of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavir pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming medicines.
As it was said, the first to reach the country's patients is the mollupiravir of Merck.
The company ended up on tape first because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find suitable treatment for equine viral disease on the South American continent.
This research is often overlooked by people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
But Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how our beak grew."
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and choose sides like AfD.
He's afraid of a cancel culture, saying this in public means losing his job and losing his media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they'll find out what people think.
It's just in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, they both have more than 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are exactly the same after the Czech three.
The same for turning units so the soldiers don't have to learn where what is, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Brdy Museum, and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, the sssr didn't want a nuclear warhead on its own territory either because of the safety or speed of deployment of the warheads due to the western position.
In these underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the entire rocket as it is said.
If it was necessary to put this weapon on, a special unit arrived to pick up this warhead and put it on some support device.
In addition to the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of primary school, we had a classmate named Cigán, we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he showed up a lot, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, often walked and wanted to explain something, missed little, walked regularly, engaged in sports with us, didn't steal snacks, didn't go on phones, he walked in clean clothes.
He also went to school in the nature, he worked in various apes, but he was fine, so I hope never a shit.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings joined the same year, another class.
Shortly after that, they beat the teacher, dealt with something there often, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sell something for an ad sometimes (old things, things I don't need, etc.) and I've often sold to the Ciggans, money has always had, they haven't tried to reach me for some attempts at price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, a guy called in a month, said he'd already rewritten.
I'm saying about myself that I'm not a racist, I don't care if anyone's white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they're acting the way they are in a decent society (working, working, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, stretches their hand, houses and flats, only messes around, troubles, whatever color it is, but I don't mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start to do business, work, learn language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my tradition and culture, I'll be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachaticka
"The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and, unfortunately, despite her resuscitation care, she suffered injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová told the South Bohemian paramedics' right.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who drove the girl.
Eighteen-year-old driver of Peugeot vehicle probably drove from the village of Žiíchovec to the municipality of Bavaria and, for reasons not yet discovered, went out to the opposite direction in the corner.
After a collision with Skoda Octavia, Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, described an accident by the spokesperson of South Bohemian police Štěpánka Schwarzová.
A young Peugat driver suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
It was a multiple injury and remained in the car in a spell.
After the release, he had to be provided with acute pre- hospital care and, in stable condition, he was transported by air to the Czech-Udědějovice hospital, said the paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from non-EU countries, and customers often do not provide data on them
Luke Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's mainly buying collector cards.
“It can usually be tens of dollars, say ten dollars higher, where it is worth to import, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free,” says the collector.
Since October, it has been slightly expensive to order small consignments, it has to add VAT and post the data to the customs procedure.
He's getting an e-mail saying customs are expecting a package coming in.
Then it is sufficient to fill in the data on the consignment, and if the VAT has not already been included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will determine it from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange for the customs procedure itself, the total amount shall also be added to the remuneration of the carrier.
According to Luke Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I'm gonna click one or two check boxes, I'm gonna insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a question of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are able to deliver smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of shipments received from abroad from 60 thousand to 15 thousand has fallen to the international post office in Prague.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to the calls for data to be supplied, which are needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
If people were filling in all the information that is needed and filling it in on time, we would be here about half, says the spokesman of the Czech Post Matyaš Vitík.
Inflation solution
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
Currently, we're at 9.9% of inflation, and it's expected to grow further.
What do you think it should be worth to slow this growth down or compensate for?
For example, we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable about where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get, like, added (who's the employee)?
I've been added 2% gross this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I run when I work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why provenly convicted rapists are being sent behind bars for, like, six months?
This just doesn't take my mind off how a court can only send an animal out of jail for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, which will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention the rape victim never needs to recover again.
Won't this discourage the potential future rape report of the victims?
A man from the tomb "fired" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from the Tomb accidentally helped the officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, on whom he was given a warrant to arrest.
He called them to her himself.
He went through a loophole.
First he approached the passer and made up a story that he was robbed.
After a call to the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and did not hesitate to tell them that the alleged “stealed” had made up his mind to come to the scene.
In fact, he wanted to advise the officers on how to submit a notification to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of a man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman was on the wanted list, in a national investigation, and was ordered to arrest her.
The case is therefore dealt with by the Czech Republic.
Honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are no longer ethnically or culturally spoken, but I am interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree, of course, with me, a pity that Churchill failed to secure the release of Prague USA :'.
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I wouldn't personally consider such a case to be a true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate in the world, if I'm not mistaken, about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods is then to be chosen?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another God.
But even in the Tenather it is said that there is no god other than Yahweh.
Wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the thousands of gods badly, and that one true god I just missed will send me to hell or some place like this?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is probably similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
This would be useful for all the ACRs.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say as follows: The cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being discussed, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of intertwining, when the labour force migrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only is this process going on constantly, we're all constantly learning something new, going from one field to another, etc.
Similar intertwining should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a relationship between a citizen and an army, an institution that guarantees that Russia, a German or a Mongolian invader will never enter here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved into stone, we have allies, and so they will prevent us if we get in trouble.
Oh, my God.
Just one election in the U.S. That's gonna twist their budget, and NATO's gonna go to hell.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they have enough to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only long-term guarantee of independence is the armed army and the population who can control the military technique of their time.
And today, he can fly remote-controlled devices every teenager can't do.
We don't need a cross-border fortification, that sucks today, but a fecking teenager behind a remote control device's book can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
You open presents under a Christmas tree and suddenly you're at home stuffed with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" re-uses e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of the shops has been created to welcome your used boxes.
Not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring them to the connected store (the map of KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid crowded blue containers.
Trades themselves welcome packaging, which is currently lacking in the market and also saved money, because the packaging box has increased by 50 % over the last period.
Moreover, in the eyes of environmentally-minded customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-drugs and eco- cosmetics.
The boxes and filling materials are carried to us in Popůvek near Brno by individuals who gather at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular shipments of delayed cartons.
We'll use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for the next generation, says Petra Lopušníková of Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the collection sites for the packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take the sorted household waste, where to hand over past drugs, tires, used electro, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
So all the garbage can end up in the right place, in addition, the re-useable things will find their second home.
The project's map contains over 100,000 such places.
“The collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find uses for things that would otherwise become waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Czech Republic.
Rather, it seems to me that nowadays technology is so simple and stupid that children who use computers or phones play games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that students of universities did not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple app for photos or actually mobile phones simply hides the underlying filesystem with folders and puts everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique since they were kids, but let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency last weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he revealed the Presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they could not make it in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and even voters like it.
Macron's supporters of the spread between the right and the left agree to little, but in Europe they do.
And in France, there will be a new election of the head of state in April.
The election calendar affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and that France is ready to create conditions for this work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately hurried with criticism that Macron was a pro-European propaganda and was rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to defend history.
The far right-wing candidate for the French president Éric Zemmour is now going around France with the idea that the Vichy regime, which worked with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and it is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea seriously for one history book, and let's not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't she be needed?
Students in European countries are often learning history as a story us versus them and never as a whole story.
Spaniards, French, Czechs know who beat who in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "mouse" didn't win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won the award for the director and the best actress Jasna Duričičova.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held the audience's top ranking.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was ccas as "have the flu/beindividual" a few days I had diarrhea and I didn't feel much to smoke...
Compared to the usual flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea for the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has it.)
Christmas Book Tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be published on 20 December, will contain a traditional literary annex.
And along with her, cultural tips will come out.
The books add to this digital edition so that you may have enough time to buy books as Christmas gifts.
Prozaic texts that follow the previous collection of Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of the world’s observation and description of everyday things with unusual poetic attention, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, photographer Szysták tried to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.
A story of a return to a root that turns out to be just a longing illusion.
The bohemist and comparatist carry the fairy tale of the Red Hood into the background of the current village.
Its application by brutality overcomes the folk version and gradates in the horror of emotional emptiness.
And the fact that going back to instincts is shorter than being willing to admit it.
The author tells a much less sentimental story about the return from emigration in his previous novel than we used to listen to.
Those who have stayed and those who have left know too little about themselves to spend it on a common life.
Trains start driving according to the new timetable, where carriers will change
From Sunday, trains begin to take place on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to ride instead of the Czech Railways.
For most lines only the departure time is adjusted, or slightly also their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The ticket sale was started by carriers in the fall.
In the new timetable, the Czech Railways plan to conduct daily averages of 6783 passenger transport connections, of which there will be daily averages of 478 long-distance trains.
Trains run around 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to the national connections under the new timetable, the routes will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will install dozens of new trains together with the new timetable.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will travel from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be delivered by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year, by 3.2 per cent on average.
The pathways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace the Czech Railways after success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
A total of 16 connections will be issued by RegioJet every day, eight in every direction.
Other changes concern remote connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also be stopped at the stations Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín.
Leo Express maintained his 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlářik, the carrier tried to maintain the most similar driving times of its long-distance trains despite the planned lock-out work.
The operation of the Arriva and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also exchange in some regional routes.
The changes are waiting for passengers, for example, to Českolipsk, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will take place on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lip to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use a uniform rail fare for the second year.
Like the Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Aren't we learning to look at the other side?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed, and how they had to work, how they died.
I've never heard lessons from the slave side or from then on, no one's defending this, just condemning it.
No one even tells you in school that blacks often sold blacks into slavery themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from Indians, they'll tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans are, they murdered while killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the U.S., directly in schools, both in northern and southern schools.
I did not meet with the fact that someone deliberately silenced the facts, but I have heard earlier that it is happening and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example, atrocities from WW2 are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about someone's feelings, it's just what they are, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at a thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this.
By the way, since we're already in the southern states, yes, the Confederal flag and the famous slaves are quite popular there, on the other hand, they've had some good successes and I find it absurd to reject them.
Moreover, the North has not been much better, as many people have idealized it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was slaves, and there were a lot of things against them.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, deliberately ignoring some facts, lying and manipulating, plus maybe there's no way that we can look at them (there was a video on YT where they left someone who started talking about our legions and 1968).
What I thought was ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that never happened to their country.
Overall, it seemed to me that in some universities it was terrible, the students were very radicalized, and the schools supported them as many times.
And if I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I'm a little sick of this being the majority's voice, because there's a young man in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has already achieved what it had, and it is no longer about the same, radicalized itself.
Today, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, are referred to as feminists, and this leads to radicalisation on the other hand, when it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Plus, the more radical someone is, the more you can hear them.
Anyway, I didn't meet with anyone judging me for colonialism or slavery either.
More like meeting the wrong geography, it was a two-sided :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do alone?
Moreover, the concept of nationality in general is considered unnecessary from the point of view of a personal identity.
If I'm connected to people's interests, world views and experiences together, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but as far as I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he has a sermon about theology rather than politics, but then he always fucks with some cocoon about the coronavirus that everyone's ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Church of Czechoslovakia Hussite.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born of Catholic modernity and are actually Catholic without the Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to the services of the Hussite, because it's theoretically very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise the church of St. Michael on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3 p.m. they perform Mass in Latin, as was done before the Vatican II.
The flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where, according to the Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the Coronavirus pandemic, but this time they took it from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing.
He was taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem's light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate with the section every year, I look forward to it too much.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, told the present journalist Amálie Budíková scout.
While the transfer took place last year at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually scouts take a train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes for the distribution of flames around the Czech Republic.
With Bethlehem's light, the scouts traditionally took a train to Brno, where they would hand it over to the diocese bishop Vojtěch Cikrlem.
On Saturday, 18 December, Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent delivery of light, which will travel by selected trains and by passenger trains.
From them the light will be taken over by local scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flames through the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, scouts have to comply with the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's just like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events, to wear dresses of course, to try to follow the distances, to do as little as possible, not to sing colleagues, simply to act as safe as possible, described Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson of the event of Bethlehem.
The tradition of Bethlehem’s light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope for the believers, of light that overcomes the darkness.
Scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread in the Czech Republic for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, flames are also a symbol of the indiscretion and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flames, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that the subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think the grant as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education make good use of this money, but I just don't understand why the money is put into agriculture, industry and overall businesses.
As mentioned - producing unnecessary product and hacking the free market and "natural life of the company".
I work alone in a factory where in the hallways there are a million pamphlets "xy financed/co-financed by the xy project" and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the company's support that gives work to x people, this is the slowdown of development when this company is both holding up and taking up contracts/employees to companies that could grow and be more productive after her demise.
Total consent, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person born at the Internet time gets caught up in a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I don't think the Internet ads are moving with me, but then I get the same idea that they've affected me too - it's just so sophisticated that you don't always defend yourself.
For this reason, I also support radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to give a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all crap, in the words of classics - I wouldn't allow the Internet.
I feel this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe anything that most believe and it makes sense, I am not sheep, but I will rather believe something less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion about which I will claim that it is critical thinking"
2. "I will not believe everything the media say"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, premiered this year have two hundred
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas films, and this year they will present their audiences in the premiere with a record of more than two hundred.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has scored and significantly increased ratings, so these images are becoming more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their name, so there will actually be many more holiday films.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are mainly fairy tales associated with this period, globally there are also popular pictures needed Home alone, Love Heavenly or Classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom of Christmas shots started only in 2009, when the American cable TV Hallmark series arrived, reminded the BBC server.
Her adventure project called Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful.
This year this station began to tune its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
This year, Lifetime has 35 new films with a Christmas theme and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the overall sum.
"In this magical period of the story it doesn't matter much, it is important that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it snows," said Brandon Gray, author of a book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace in the middle of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the past few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark still uses the same recipe for his films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which, of course, resolves successfully, and those two kiss.
It's like this all the time, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people follow one another, adds Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, he will not enter the final F1 race.
Only nineteen riders will go to the Great Award of Abu Dhabi in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not enter the last race of the season.
The Haas stable will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season he was supposed to attack a better location from the 20th position, which he made in the qualification.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from Haas stable will not eventually intervene in the Great Award of Abu Kill.
He was tested positive for Covid-19.
Only 19 cars will appear on the starting grid, and from the last position will head to the track of the Mazepin teammate Mick Schumacher, the first Max Verstappen to fight for the title in a direct battle against Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepin is relatively well, according to Haas stables, and shows no symptoms.
Nikita's physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, while safety will be a final priority for all stakeholders," said her representatives for formula1.com.
He can't even send a spare rider to the Haas race.
Any alternate would have to have completed the qualification or driving in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not the first racer.
At the start of the just ending season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year they were positively tested by Sergio Pérez No Lewis Hamilton.
You could get arrested for this, too.
And everyone's gonna be the one who doesn't give a shit about the boss.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price list of the most expensive sweater will impress!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put a six-month job into it and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, my sweaters never wore much at home," admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours over his work.
Silk bought in Italy, 24 carat gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals was supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but the silk adds a sweater softness," the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell my sweater as quickly as possible," admits Lebanon.
If he succeeds, he will create a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago was "just" CZK 720 000.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Females, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested the assistance of NATO States, in connection with several months of ongoing actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle East countries to their territory with a false promise to easily cross the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers already operate in the Polish territory.
The Omicron mutation spreads in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene's investigating another case of a child from Adam.
“We are currently reporting further suspicions of this option with another child from Adam’s preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov University is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases occurred in the county in a week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Neopus Virus of the State Health Institute in Prague,” said the director.
She added that it was two nurses from one department of the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children from one of them, two eleven-year-old students from Adamov University.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adam.
Three of them, according to the principal, have mild symptoms, four asymptomatic course.
No one suspected of traveling to Omicron abroad
None of the above have traveled abroad, nor have any of their families, nor have they come into contact with anyone who would live abroad.
There is none of the championships in the water pole, says Ciupek.
The main hygiene Pavela Svryčinová previously stated that an international tournament in the water pole was being examined, which was in Brno a few weeks ago.
There were also players from South Africa and a Belgian player got sick after returning.
California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in a non-partisan state.
The Governor of California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to ban the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions carried out after the detection of the heart rate of the embryo.
People would then be entitled to compensation for anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to a Friday opinion of the US Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in force, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict, which laid down the right to abortion throughout the United States until about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court of First Instance has now not ruled on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical question that arises from the innovative design of the measures.
The enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public in this case, making the Texas Republicans impossible to attack him by the usual judicial route.
“I am outraged by yesterday’s (fifth) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which permitted the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas’s maneuver to protect its law,” said the Governor of California.
"If now states can block the review of their laws by federal courts, California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He has been instructed by his subordinates to work, in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice, on measures that would entitle the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
In this way, the home-made weapons, which do not have serial numbers, are identified as being used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants them to have a "private citizens" right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over CZK 220 000) and judicial expenses from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, components into "weapons of ghosts" or sets for their production.
"If the most effective way is to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets, to create the threat of private actions, we should do exactly that," said the California Governor.
AP notes that for decades California has banned the production and sale of certain military-style weapons, but in June the federal judge blocked the ban here as anti-constitutional.
If the State had actually reinstated the ban using the Texas Template, the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor, who, in a dissenting opinion on the Friday majority verdict, warned against the extension of the legal mechanism to other US states, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant a complete immunity against judicial review to the Texas abortion ban and allowed abortion clinics to continue the proceedings against selected officials of the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its public test phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccine itself is being improved, based on the results.
For example, a large study of the effects of 4 doses has already been conducted in Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, she'll have her vaccination schedule in time, but it's too soon.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine, based on inactivated virus, should come to the market, which, according to the manufacturer’s specifications, promises to be up to 10 times more effective.

Poland has threatened to halt payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act contrary to the law if it exercised new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for drawing on EUR 36 billion from the EU Fund for the recovery of the economies affected by the Covidia-19 pandemics.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small party Solidar Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose a close majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland halt its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable given that the EU is illegally denying us funds from the common budget, which we are also contributing to, the Polish minister has added.
In its approach to the EU, its party takes more radical positions than the ruling party to Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that Poland's justice has undergone for Ziostrovoi threaten its independence and submit it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, builds “the impossible conditions, because its aim is not the rule of law, but the change of government in Poland”.
Warsaw is facing “a political dictatorship conducted by blackmailing and trying to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles,” Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels as a result of which the sovereignty of Poland would be restricted.
"We will never agree to Poland's status as a colony," he said.
But to know about it... there's one kind of cheese in four different places in Lidlo.
I haven't looked at other things, I've met one yogurt several times, all I needed was cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves, I resigned and I asked.
They had it, that's true, in the narrow sector, they were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the nolactosis zone...
If there's an avoidance, I don't smell any more market, action no action, gold shop in the square, maybe they don't have that choice, but they usually have everything I need, and it's in order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidlu to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
I've been here for two years watching him deal with data like manure, and most of the opponents of the vaccination are just a little more out of the bowl than most of the supporters of the vaccination.
Rational discussions are ongoing at the expert level, but only extreme views are made in the public space.
Always from the wall to the wall.
Binar reasoning: vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.

Color pies instead of robust analyses.
Comparison of apples with pears.
This country has it this way, and we have it this way.
But that the methodology for collecting data is different in these two states.
Ugh, I'm so relieved.
Sorry about the outburst and have a nice day to all of you.
When I was a kid, they punished me with a boil.
It was never because of stamps, most of the time it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and got angry (read instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mother always threatened that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after the next "catching" of the dish only brought and laid it so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, did I get a couple of butt wounds (over clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial because the child responds to them much more than words.
I think it's important that part with a warning because it gives the child his choice to listen and get it, or he'll get it better, and there'll be no punishment.
At the end of the day, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
System Defence
When the leading Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalistic question in 1999, what does the Czech Constitution mean for him – whether the sacred document on which he swears and about which he has been taught since childhood at school, or, on the contrary, the agreement that can be changed if necessary, he certainly inclined to the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and the changes are better spared.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Like Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl voted that time.
Recently, however, the view that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes has been becoming increasingly common among lawyers.
The years have been tested by situations that its creators (which Vojtěch Cepl belonged to) could not predict, for example, the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political intervention in their texts must be thought through.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to dealing with most of the crises that societies across history face.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of rule of government consisting of individual rules which lay down the policies of the game.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we tie up policies.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno they're fighting for the lives of a few months old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder to children, there are also some difficult cases that hospitals have encountered mainly recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, there is talk of 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik told the new chief of the Department of Paediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University.
The course is much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
However, there are children's patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," said Dominik.
According to your doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at a clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were in the doctor’s department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, pneumonia, which requires staying on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease is affecting both adolescents and several months old babies alongside adults.
Hospitals also have children in severe condition due to coronavirus.
"At present, the child lies with us for months and underage," said the prime minister.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths have been reported at the FN Brno children's hospital.
According to available data, six children aged 0-14 years died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominika, he is an integral part of the psychologist’s cooperation in the children’s hospital – not only in the coronavirus department.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, vaccination in children reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
“We therefore recommend the use of the vaccine dose in children,” said the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk along marked paths.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
You can see on the tourist map on maps.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but do not cross the fence into the area).
Skiing/bike-riding in the forest outside the marked trails is not allowed unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so guarded outside the national parks).
How's the conductor doing?
The music is in my head, Joseph Kurfiřt is laughing.
He was breast-fed by the Liberec Opera and originally played the forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing practically all repertoire and as a conductor not only in the Liberec Theatre of F. Šalda, but also in Pilsen, in Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He cooperates with the Castle Philharmonic, with the Film Philharmonic or with the Podkrkonoší symphony orchestra.
China builds the impression of a controlled disease and the fact that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis
Sinologist Jiruš: China is building the impression of a controlled disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China went to medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected criticism that he could not stop a disease that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero increments of the infected.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protection aids and Chinese doctors are often helping to fight the coronavirus, for example, in Italy’s worst affected.
How do you feel about Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend and says, hey, you don't want an elephant?
I got him, and he's great.
The wife likes it because she saves the weed, washes the car with the octopus, the kids play with it.
Well, that's just great.
If you want $5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Let's have a high five, that'll be great.
After a while they'll meet and the one who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant?????
The lawn's broken, the giant shit, the car's all over the place, the kids are fighting him, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The guy who sold it says you're talking about an elephant, you're not selling an elephant like that...
World events are controlled by powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is precisely the power that determines the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
It has so far worked at the level of economic and political (on selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years from now.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different, and it will work.
I thought about it, too, and it's pretty much possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm just saying a word.
I'm just based on the fact that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment entitled "Spanish Oranges and Mandarins", when it is clear that these are both from Spain, whereas for "Spanish Fruit and Mandarins" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, it is based on the fact that the sentence is "all American forces" including their weapons and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad concept and that there is no need to further specify it for the American forces.
But again, I'm just saying :D
Either way, it's a senseless request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured Milly's alien monkey
The scary shots show the moment when the scared monkey shrug in the toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed her and laughed at her.
Holland's monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and burgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent's Magistrate Court has now banned her from breeding animals for life, informed The Sun.
Experts in the rehab of monkeys who care about Milly after her abuse said they've never seen such a scared cosmos before.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating at Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now she's playing happily with another rescued monkey named Moon again.
A four-time mother confessed to two accusations of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
In Gwent's main court, she was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment with parole for one year.
Holland has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, has been banned from breeding animals for life and has to pay 12,000 crowns of legal expenses.
Team leader, Steph Sawyer, who rehabilitated the abused animal, said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue further."
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She was shoving and hiding from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, the view of new people can still cause panic.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, adds Sawyer.
The abuse of Milly came out after the Gwent police discovered horrific images of a woman's phone after a raid in her apartment for drug charges.
You can hear Milly swearing vulgarly on the footage.
The next video shows how Holland offers cocaine to a monkey and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possession of cocaine with the intention to sell it.
In her house, cocaine was found for £1,600 (in the count of less than CZK 50,000) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was given a parole for 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistoric three times in a row when you bravely jump over the entire 20th century?
Like, you're gonna take the same things as sixth grade in freshman year?
And this whole thing kills the idea of bifling, where nobody, the honor of exceptions, doesn't care if you know it or not.
Just write the test on one, and then nobody cares.
Go on and on the street, randomly ask people if they can handle the character of the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
Everyone's been through this, and the absolute majority won't even cross off and tell you they're totally fucked.
Then what the fuck is he learning?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the fact is, people don't want and don't need to.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get it in.
It's partly taught for a lot of people who need that thing.
But, like, that note that you don't really need all this for standing at the machine, I was totally serious because you just don't need it.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a stamp of punk.
(Which our communist past is probably involved in, and our angry against, education and elites) But the price of the barbarics standing at us is simply high.
For example, if journalists could count, Covid probably never reached these dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: The war of Kadri and Andrea continues!
Which is the main reason Switzerland cannot leave immediately," Andrea answered instagram in Stores about all the questions of curious fans, which disappointed her so much on Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
It's been grunting between Kadri and Andrea since the experiment began.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to see her, at least until he returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely rejected it.
And as you can see, their relationship not only didn't end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! He was angry with Kadri’s turn in response to Andrea’s accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
The alleged honesty of Kadri's ex-wife didn't even like his younger sister Linda anymore.
She decided to stand up for her brother in public.
Normally, I don't talk about these things at all, and even in my family, we've never really said these things to each other.
I certainly don't want to make you feel sorry for yourself.
When I see someone trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I love so much, he's just not gonna give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to thank my brother Kadri publicly for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was young.
I'm even more sorry to have to read this untruthful information that's probably pretty out of context.
I would love to know Kadri as much as I, our loved ones and our family, are in their confessions in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what it says, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else, and we know the reality, and we know how it really was, added infinitely.
Drunk thief climbed the facade on the fifth floor.
You're not gonna believe why.
He started his robbery trip in a parking lot in the residential district where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the information available, he finally alienated less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
Then he had no better idea than to climb up to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
On a security camera, he's caught walking down the street from the crime scene eating a banana.
When the owner woke up this morning, he found out the bananas weren't where they were and called the police.
Caa was subsequently detained.
A man confessed to drinking alcohol on an incriminating day.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob in drunkenness.
The whole thing's still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade on the 5th floor where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is limited in time and efficiency is linked to the pandemic emergency.
If it's cancelled, the law won't be effective.
Although the law limits the scope of business
Is that not enough for you?
The right to gather will be limited, but not cancelled.
More than 60 percent of the voters came to the Saturday elections in four municipalities.
The new representatives of the people voted in the villages of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Mosteck, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovné in Pelhřimov.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people are writing to you.
You're just playing dumb so you can have a fight.
If not, it's sad.
I do not claim that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes in it.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it dug up, suppressing science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, for example, the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: Believe in a spaghetti monster, but state and church have nothing to do
A man fell his head down from 50 feet.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, where the paramedics of the Regional Medical Rescue Service stepped in.
Regional Operations Center workers received an emergency call an hour after Saturday midnight with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two ZZS crews – medical and medical – went to the site immediately.
Upon arriving, the paramedics found that a 27 - year - old man would fall from a window about six feet [12 m] high and fall head to head on concrete!
It caught coal in Vitkovice.
But not as it should be, and the firemen went into action.
At the time of the arrival of rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and a direct threat to his life.
The intrusive physician intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and, after further measures in pre- hospital emergency care, carried him into the next care of the Ostrava traumatological center, informed the spokesperson of the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I'm more concerned than the coronavir, because I'm not responding to the public and the authorities.
The spread of coronavir in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of the fight against infection stands mainly doctors and health personnel.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking a military doctor named David the Butcher.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had an amazing gala evening full of interesting results.
There were things going on at the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found a slayer in seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in lightweight, he showed great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt off technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
That's what brought the women's bantam weight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American woman entered each other as a conceited "twarf," since Nunes has not lost seven years and has cut her teeth into another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the way behind the victory very actively, and her opponent even provided a push kick that sent her to the ground.
However, Peña was not forced to make any other mistake and successfully tried to attack herself with a hand lever.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both competitors were involved in a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Plus, Nunes got her on the ground where she started choking her.
She had to give up her efforts and knock off the attack.
The American girl prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became a new champion.
The top of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a title in a light weight.
At first, although Poirier was better off, the card gradually began to turn.
In the other, he was trying to be more active with Oliveira, who tried to beat his opponent with a hand lever.
Although he did not succeed, he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back, and got a lot of wounds.
That's why he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear naked choke, which Poirier had to knock off for a while.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, on the contrary Poirier lost after two years.
In the next game, Sean O'Malley took a sovereign triumph, which he had already put on Raulian Paiva with a hard right back.
Then he beat him with a series of accurately targeted punches and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little girl, now she's lost after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first sight, it's nothing complicated.
Most of the essential names in the Czech language are expressed only by one grammatical family, so it is not difficult to determine whether it is a male, female or middle family.
Then there is also a relatively large group of essential names, in which the family is not stable.
Such essential names fluctuate between two generations.
When tilting, they acquire two ends, and in some cases they remain in the same form.
For example, the words "tightness" or "crying" are male and female, in the first one they bow according to the pattern of "machine", in the second according to the pattern of "song".
For other groups of essential names, the different shapes are already in the first fall of the single number, such as ‘order/row’, ‘kadluben/kadlubna’ or ‘brambor/brambora’ (as in the sense of food).
Both shapes are scriptural, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as “courage” in Bohemia and “courage” in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is inconclusive, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: “kop” and “kopa”, “kupa” and “bout” etc.
Some of the words that penetrated the Czech language were originally incompetent, but gradually take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression “image”, which is male and female, or the word “bupret”, which remained in the middle race inconclusive, but in the male family has endings according to the pattern “hrad”.
Turkey has opened its way for migrants to Europe.
What's the situation on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants who are trying to move on to Europe.
Thousands of people began to travel to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped stopping them.
European politicians promise to support Greece, humanitarian aid is also planned by the Czech government.
What is it that motivates refugees to go in uncertain ways?
And what does the situation look like right there?
We haven't seen the blue sky for three months and suffocated, describes a Sydney journalist.
The devastating fires Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the inhabitants themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects from being, as critics say?
And what will countries need to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a journalist from Sydney Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone's always written all over the place.
It's uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society, and how widespread it is, so they're trying to book it.
I don't know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how they often treat these people around them, or even the police.
The victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the charge is made up" and that it's "trend" you only help the sexual rapists.
Czech Republic floods built houses, families don't have the money to finish
Construction materials prices have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into a bad situation.
She has no funds to complete her family homes, and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of materials, the price of construction works is increasing.
So people don't have enough money to finish their old family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
Better yet, people are moving into separate and unscathed homes.
In the worst case case, the built-in houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and pay their rents," says the economist BHS Štěpán Křeček.
We'll build two or three family houses in a year, and 50 percent of it happened to us.
As a construction company, it's hard for us to keep some things contractually, even though the material is expensive.
So we do without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slovň.
A lot of people will still have financial problems.
If they were counting on building a house to be worth five million, now it's going to cost seven.
I think some will wait," Slovň added.
From the material, copper, iron, as well as plumber and heating equipment were the most irrigated.
Construction companies are also struggling with labour shortages.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of construction and the influx of foreign workers are lacking in pandemics.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issue of a building permit is more favourable.
“In October, 7,675 building permits were issued by the construction authorities, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” Křeček stated.
We're good, and we're gonna get even better.
The real vision, however, is missing, says the commentator of the Czech Republic – myRadio
In addition to classical celebrations, politicians have traditionally been accompanied by the accession to the new year.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and President Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, President Zeman and Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What's the key we've learned?
As a diploma, I think it's great, I have my own theme, which I have chosen, I follow up with my bachelor, I always work on it for a whole year, and then in a week or two, I write a written piece.
The state is perfectly calm here, if there's no such thing as a total macaque, and there's something left in his head, then the committee won't be suffocating him to theory for nothing.
For example, I've been studying for the state for a week, and when I was at the end, the committee's always trying to get me on some logical background, which I was right to do, and I was right.
Otherwise, on these projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we did it many times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they get well enough.
I think it's cool if at the end of the course there's a test to project knowledge, not just defense.
All right, but don't cover your e-mails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same dick as them.
Those people at the embassy have nothing to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they'd risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar Putin statue next to the bear Pooh statue.
Maybe you can just put it in a way that puts Xi Jinping on his ass or something.
I agree, despite the fact that Insta throws a stick at artists.
Once every day you don't give stories and at least every other day a new picture, your ranges will be reduced to the very minimum.
In addition, it still changes what function is more important if the latch, comment or save.
I don't give a shit these days, so I might have to cut to a tictok where a lot of artists in my business are successful and won't let that happen.
In the end, I would like to see something more user-friendly that doesn't suck out all creativity and energy from artists.
Declaration by the Working Party on Donbase
The Union – yes, broken – no, the opponents of the crash of the USSR express their opinion on the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal destruction of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in the history of mankind took place.
In the Bělyvěžský forest on 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevič, without any legal authority and by violating the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open leniency of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, irrespective of the people, signed an agreement that "The Union of the SSR as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one cut of the pen, they "rescinded" a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
Tens of millions of Russian citizens were found abroad by the fall of the USSR.
Since the early 1990s, the Russian population has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Even though the population of the former Soviet republics is lost to the Nerusan, we have already lost more people than in two world wars combined!
Previously, the same people who destroyed what was built in the previous seventy years during one session in the Bělyva Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
Consciously, they deindustrialized, braked agriculture, removed fourteen republics that had previously been economically linked into a single mechanism from the world’s greatest power.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the poverty of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO's expansion to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the first socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum".
Everything that was in a hurry betrayed and given up quickly filled and conquered NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken up today because of the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs CZK 189/kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and make it a Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality, in which I do not buy the meat on Monday, it will be reduced to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday's chain - describe to me the mechanism, which changes its price becomes a burden for my digestive system?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - what would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK irritable and leave it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer for myself - nothing.
All this crap about how when something's cheap, it must be guaranteed wrong, corrupt, or wrong, they're terribly retarded to tell you the truth ;-)
Now, I've been going to the Hlavas in Brno recently, and there's a brochure in the attic of the ladies, and I'm always taking stuff like that to help the brigades, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views of the world's functioning, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be some sort of agitation.
After reading, I found out who was publishing it, and the scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was a good stuff, full of useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash myself and not be a pussy.
It's a waste of paper. That's why the forests wouldn't have to hang out.
Something like this I had with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with this person because you like him without knowing how much the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk about.
Or maybe when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she cried and begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
About a year ago, it was a great relationship, but then another six months went by and started fucking her head.
Then I ended the relationship with her telling her I was breaking up and lying to her, but we can talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch any amok again.
Such a person sucks out of you feelings, emotions and overall joy.
You'd better keep your distance.
When insurance companies are being robbed furiously by buying a cloud of tests and chasing positives who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease if they didn't even know about the test.
All we're getting is complications for companies, carriers, and others, because their employees in the random number generator fell five days of house arrest.
In the west, they've stopped the clownhouse, and they've decided it's no use dealing with the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the war is new, and it has to steal something else and drive an ego by inventing faggots.
I see we've got a good old bastard coming back.
After several years of dampening and suppressing this unfair business, the MLM recruiting again returns to the sun.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at the university), initial promises about product training and business skills quickly shifted to "you don't need to care, especially get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and talk.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to make a few products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, so that made a person feel like an obsessive pot salesman.
What I can tell you is, the experience was valuable, you learnt not to jump right on every bit of information and check it out.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw everyone in one sack.
People are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I've never seen much of this in a corporate where I've never done much.
HR is calm, managers are looking at their management, and they're not sticking our noses into anything.
Regular evaluation is happening in some way, in the form of what it is going on in our country (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what has come out and what does not) - it is more of a self-assessment than that someone would evaluate you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we're also a little unique within our company - there's a department that's more corporate.
Sometimes you feel like we're kind of a start-up that squats in the offices of a big corporate, no.
But it doesn't work that way. It doesn't bother us much as long as we get results.
The Czechs missing in Britain are dead.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days, the British police searched for the missing 32-year-old Czech Republic, which disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in resignation Jakub Kulhánek on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradištska had been found dead.
Unfortunately, this afternoon, British police confirmed to our representative office in London that they found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not share more information on the case.
I'm sorry for your loss.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on 28 November on the way from work, and she was supposed to pick up the cash from the ATM before she got on.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues at work five days later.
Then the London police started looking for her, Interpol classified her as one of the missing people around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police have already arrested one man in this context a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspected he was, but she didn't release it.
In four municipalities, at the end of the year, new representatives were awarded
On Saturday, 11 December, in the villages Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice na Mostecko, Nová Ves na Liberecka and Rovná na Pelhřimovsko, new representatives were elected.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law of the number set or the elected representatives have broken down here.
The 28 mandates for the new elections were 99 valid candidates.
Electoral participation reached 62,41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62 % of the eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate documents were registered for the new elections to the representatives in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representation posts.
The median age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
There were squares of new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very followed elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
Most of the time, we had to work in more demanding epidemiological conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, evaluated.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me at the very beginning of my life to cope with the fact that we had a rather dangerous infectious disease here, but it took me a while to do so without any major troubles.
Dealing with how idiotically a large part of the population is facing this on all its layers, that's what I'm having a problem with right now.
I look forward to vaccination (to tomorrow!) the most because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be deprived of the position of president and the ability to regain it.
The chances of that really happening are, however, as the others here mention very small.
Besides, I'm not sure the Cartman's file could be considered treason at all.
Betrayal is such an act that the President of the Republic threatens sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has influenced intimate life: The number of people to 35 years of age who are without sex has been growing for a year
More and more young adults in the U.S. live their lives without sex.
These are mainly religiously based people, says the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of younger 35 people who renounced sexual life rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said that they had not had sexual intercourse in the last year are more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decrease in the number of sexually active individuals, showed a survey of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these could be the economic impact of a coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games could also contribute to young people making sex less and less of a priority.
"The proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age has been growing rapidly since 2010 and says that they have not had sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
In marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, only 5% of them reported having been sexless in the last year, in 2021.
For single people, it was 29%, and Stone added that marriages under 35 are only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious founding also contribute to the loss of sexual activity.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under 35 is still decreasing.
Young people think about premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that single individuals in this age group are a minority, but their behavior is shifting this trend," Stone says about these 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital relations, the reason for religious founding is because of the fact that they are involved in premarital relations.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60% for single people younger than 35 years of age who have attended religious meetings more than once a month.
Between the "less believers" the trend rose from 10% to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and, above all, social drinking during the pandemic period.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is less in people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason could be the expansion of digital media, which seem to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus replacing this need.
This trend was mainly caught behind the lockdown at the time of the coronavir pandemic.
The whole order of covid vaccination is whether society should force a part of the population to behave that they do not want but that can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, which I am personally most interested in about social conscience.
I mean, for example, the question is, if we don't tell them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, we heard some disinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated and he finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we're responsible for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who, by the side of the SPD and the CRS, is screaming about the bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly imported that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the other group, so they will actually be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign a dry fight?
This year's winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent years.
The operators of ski resorts can not do without technical snow, the weather also complicates the preparation of ski resort Jizerské 50ky.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against the dry in the Czech Republic?
I should have one story, but it's not about the pancake.
One time in high school, the teacher led us across the city to the shipyard so we could take a boat ride across the river.
On the way there we walked once on such a pretty wide street and who we don't see in the middle - the followers of the sect of Hare Krishna.
Of course, they fell on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but with a friend, they got into it.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she said to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already falling apart, says Orozovich
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels on Sunday arrived in Warsaw, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honour.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," said Morawiecki at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border is to be dealt with by means of diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normander Group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that the Chancellor had informed about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered a migration crisis and used people as living targets and weapons, because night after night we record hundreds of attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
The Chancellor discussed further sanctions to ensure that Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to the DPA, Scholz ensured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhuman treatment of Lukashenko’s regime with its runners.
Drunk Polish artisan caused the accident, tried to hide it.
After a while, the car returned to the scene, but the car was being driven by another nun who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could lose her driver's license in case she didn't give up driving and driving from the crash site, she came out with the truth, said TVN24.
She admitted that another nun crashed into the vehicle who asked for her help.
The police came for Sister Celestine.
They gave her a breath test, and after they found out that she had more than two millennia in her blood, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, she was told that she would testify in court for her actions.
Hugo's dog is doing his best.
But Juraj Shaimovich didn't watch his film.
Czech family comedy creators looked into American stories about dog sweethearts.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film industry.
After the cheesy film F. Brabce Gump - a dog that taught people how to live, there's another film missing about the viewer's emotions in the cinemas.
The co-author of the script and the director in one person Juraj Šajmovic ml. freely follows his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
The talking Badger Hugo and some famous characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guesthouse, who are dying, will begin inviting the doggy, Julia's father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronica.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences first love.
The director and partner Beatriz Šajmovicová (who is also a producer of the film) have been struggling with the narration procedures already in the previous film, but there they entertained at least children and dogs.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker scenario that provokes a mixture of amazement and awkwardness.
Let's get this over with.
Julie, although a scientist, is subject to a desire for a child's dark delusions and if the correct "constellation" comes, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determined – on the hood of a car or church tower (of course during an ongoing tour with a local guide), the retired Colonel Mojmír, despite his years of training, will shoot his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who will fall into a coma, and the hospital is taken from the family so that in the heart of Sumava loneliness he can perform a miraculous process of dog healing.
Nothing against the cleansing of nature and the strength of animal sweethearts.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, marvels at the content pelmela filled with unbelieving situations and figures.
Two thieves from the staff, a competition of doggers, a Šumava charlatan, cops coming to search for "drugs" and discussing herbs about fertiliser strength of bone meal – which a roasted family in the guest house of course drunks.
When a heroine wakes up after a severe coma and then sits naondulated and painted with a cigarette at the family table and asks for his father's whiskey and flakes as a cured vegetarian, you can't laugh.
On top of the viewer, the creators will explain that “this sometimes happens after a coma”.
Šajmovic's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of work with text, the ability to build a supporting situation, a feeling for characters and the point and direct management.
The performances are unbalanced, the cut is helpless and the overall impression is attentive.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková and Nela Boud are trying to stop their party, they have too much to play.
The only signatories of the film remain the poetic images of the Šumava nature cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of badgers.
It is not enough to draw a few characters, a chatty plot and dog catchphrase, let alone the more folk vulgar expressions that the characters do.
The argument is not even an old membership at the Dachshund breeder's club - as in the case of the producer.
The good intentions of promoting the nature and friendship of a dog must be knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a true story.
This failed in this case.
There's a little too much erotic and minimal feeling for the genre for a good family picture.
Even as an ad for canistherapy, this amateur-conception piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuses exactly from morons like you.
There's a difference between offering and coercion, and you can see how you don't understand shit, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened like that all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which case it's a profit brigade.
The Middle East is troubled by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only season in the year it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as recorded at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli meteorological service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term precipitation average as of November.
The two - day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a while.
It is also the right Christmas scene, rejoicing with the inhabitants of Nazareth by Vasí Ashkar.
The rainfall in Israel is almost exclusively in the winter months, impacting and irregular.
There are dependent forests in the winter rains.
Without them, they're dry and prone to fire.
It is not only about forests, it is also about supplies of drinking water and damage for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
Water farmers warned about the drought a long time ago.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may decrease here," said Uri Schor, spokesperson of the Office for Water Management in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
There are economicly weak countries like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan worse.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Ammon, there are increasing tankers.
The water lines and the private wells are drying out.
"This year, I had my orders increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years," said the driver of the Imád Sulejman tanker car in September.
There were clashes between farmers and security forces in Iran’s Isphahan.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The local riverbed found itself completely waterless.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing military action against Iran
The Israeli Minister for Defence stated that the Vienna negotiations had not made "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, says Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the United States, is trying to convince Americans to increase their pressure on Iran, but also to inform Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and world powers “understand that Iranians are playing with them”.
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I've been pawging a little and grilling a little while talking to her to find out what she wanted me to do.
I finally found that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, so I've been pushing the missus with doubts and questions for a while and finally thanking and leaving.
You can tell me I've been a bully, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers set off to the mountains this weekend, waiting for them enough snow and nice weather
On this weekend, the mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first greater demand for skiing.
After a strong snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow and some ski resorts have started operation.
The skier did not even discourage the obligation to prove himself with a covid certificate at the lifts.
While the skiers do not complain about the lack of customer interest, some ski rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to cross-country tracks and downhills on weekends.
The skiers wished for the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We’re happy, the opening weekend really came out from Friday night skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill,” said Ještěd, Director of Sports Centre, Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went to Jeseník during their first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the ski arena Karlovov or the center in Branná in Šumperk was opened.
The weekend visit was very decent, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are cool.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so the perfect, did not spare the praised representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Skiareal operators may only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or who are within a period of time after the covid-19 disease.
Except for the exceptions, people are prepared for this and show the necessary documents, said ČTK René Hronáš from the ski centre Špindlerův Mlýn.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Less interested than a pandemic, some ski rental and equipment stores report.
Fortunately, the interest in ski rental is.
It's not like last years, but there's still a lot of customers, brought up by Alexandra Bokiš from the Skiopava Shop.
The greater intensity awaits during the skiing courses period.
The director of Snowbear, David Shinták, also feels that Covid is not interested in renting ski equipment as before.
By that time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we were about 50 percent, said ČTK Shinták.
According to him, people were lazy with a pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded in the Novako area on God’s Gift.
Ski rental started there a week ago and the people already have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to borrow the races this weekend, but people have already called forward, so we expect a great deal of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator.
According to her, interest is comparable to the pre-occupational period is also about a ski school.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, we must have the opportunity to experience a quality of life abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a doctor specialist.
There's smart and skillful people going abroad who don't have any property.
The owner of the company abroad is not going anywhere.
With the rest but completely consent.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will not just live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began so that one beautiful day Orbán won, the year reigned, and suddenly annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the election at all.
If things get bad around here, some traditional V4 freak can win.
The young and the educated will leave, the supporters will remain, and the people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood for a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic it was in full autumn, in Thailand the crew of the film Island headed by Jiří Langmayer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
An actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is this a real injury, or is this about the filming?
London police are still looking for the missing Czech Republic.
Last seen on the way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior at all, and we are starting to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the Metro Police Department in Lambeth, where Srncová worked in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and she simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her missing Czech Republic, around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday 28 November, she left work and headed home to Camberwell.
She was reportedly seen on the bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3rd by one of her coworkers.
Srncová, according to the British media, was a “assist of nurses” at the children’s hospital, Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas.
"We are very concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," said the group of medical facilities in the twitter paper.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that might help find her to contact the police," the message continued.
The public also calls on Mrs Harriet Harman to cooperate, who called on the Srnce case on Saturday at a press conference.
“She has been missing for a few days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are, of course, worried about her death,” said a Labourist politician, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, and she worked here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have already arrested a man in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC news site, however, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man was suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
That's not how I underestimate Ukraine.
That's not "a huge amount," it's about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating the threat of the Invasion and is beginning to have its teeth full.
I quoted upstairs.
I don't know what he thought Russia wanted a war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
Comparing the situation in 38 is so far off that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare this with the first Punishment war and the "anexia" sílie :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to comply with the Minsk Agreement, Russia was advocating those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the concentration at the border would do.
Oh, paceta sunt servandada...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, especially for suburban connections
Travellers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are expecting several changes from Sunday, especially in connection with suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslav is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday there are fasteners from České Budejovice in the station Gardenní Město.
In suburban train transport, S7 trains will take the route from Beroun to České Brod to Prague's main railway station.
In the recently operational station Prague-Zahradní Město will newly stop the R17 from České Budějovice and Benešova.
PID is now expanding to other areas.
Among other things, buses will take to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna near Jesenice, Old Splavů and Turnov.
Buses will be integrated in Mladoboleslav region, including lines with crossings to Liberec and Královéhradecké region.
77 lines will be cancelled during integration, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be modified.
A new 405 bus line will take off from Zličín in Prague, which will go all the way to Zatce.
A new direct connection has also been created Prague – Kralovice near Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be strengthened in the morning peak and on the weekend of the connection from Prague to Rakovník, when the express line number 404 will be released.
Newly included are the PID lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec region.
They leave the metro station Střížkov, not from the Railway Station Holešovice.
The spineline 400 goes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lipa to Nový Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimona and Jablonny in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the operation on the ten central Bohemian local lines, including Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín, is cancelled or restricted.
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Praha – Beroun, Praha – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín.
The changes are also waiting for passengers in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dobříš with the link from Prague, where you can use the PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The route between 540 and 543 lines in Nymburk was changed and some buses on the border of central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region were adjusted.
Healthy snacks/meal to the supermarket office
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only chance of getting food is to go next door to Billy or just a little further to Lidlu.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'm going to buy a pizza of jelly and a snack of yoghurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend to buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone's waiting for a meter of snow like you, that's what I'm afraid it is.
And it's not the trees you need to see.
Only a tree tip can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're not allowed to go off the slopes, but it's one of them.
A gift's confession about a relationship with Ned: I wasn't looking forward to this.
The Czech show business pond has been alive since Friday except by revealing the relationship between Dara Rollins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been pulling it together for years, the famous football player even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to the fans explaining why love has been hidden from them for half a year.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who has escaped that Dara has caught a bear, i.e. sorry, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rollins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He said he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are accustomed to public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but we knew that one day, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse.
Whether those who don't care at all and jump on them and out of the can, or we, whose lives they distract in detail.
It's like one of you wants to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or your girlfriend are good enough, or you insisted that everyone really knows your list of your former partners and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's cool, that's what you want, Dar.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins went to to prepare her new fashion collection.
The bear has long been acting as Vice President of the Juventus Football Club.
They only went out with the truth now because they were waiting for Ned's divorce to be completed.
They have been separated for three years with Ivan’s wife, but they are not married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We're just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man, and just as he did with me, I stand by him. For good and bad, she closed the Rollins.
Hi, the other commentators have probably already said everything, but I'm just confirming that colleges are great at the beginning, my classmates usually met and became friends during the first semester or two, and then they found a place to live together, which seems like the best option for me, because you know who you're gonna live with.
Well, flats don't usually advertise too long in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but I'm sure it won't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, avoid not only Cejla, but also the surroundings (the streets like Vranovská, French etc., this is a pretty bad address), but some parts of the Jews are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Verveří district is very student, the King's field and in that direction it is nice, besides it is close to most BUT faculties (I don't know where exactly you get on).
I've never sought rent, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can eventually advise Brno as such if you still lack some information :)
What an example of "normal" thinking.
In fact, because of what several doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is quite right that the state does not fund certain schools enough.
Either they teach themselves what they want, and they pay it out of their own hands, or they go according to the state, and they pay the state.
After all, we can't let a private actor take over a piece of education just because he's going to add a few crowns to a full state contribution, and he's going to be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such claims are somewhat lost by weight when written by a person who spoke this way two days before about a petition action for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So the vote against having an abortion is the same as the voice against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I'd be consulting directly with the guy who hired you to do the job.
Otherwise, I've seen in the catalog/digitalization that (even longtime professionals) it either goes from the eye, or write something in the way of xxx *** or ... (by convention) and in the note that it is illegitimate.
The truth is, in this case, it's pretty readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it.
Personally, I'd deal with it in some way, depending on the program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and hard-working student, you can look into some sign databases and find the closest ones.
But since it looks like you're drawing on some book, I'd guess the author or printer simply created his own character that fits into what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it the Odry Realm (King) rather than the OdryNska?
PSS: You've been cracked.
Take a look at this comment with ,
Politicians have no idea what will be the theme of our Presidency.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is smiling.
All the important documents that have been approved are examined by the word for word, and that's not enough for some basic knowledge of English anyway, that's a matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in different EU institutions, and English is more suitable for informal relations, for establishing above-standard relations.
Moreover, with English it is quite interesting, after the performance of GB from the EU.
I don't get that hate on Ceyl.
I've been working there for the third year, and I'm fine.
How many times do I drive from work at 10:00 and never a problem?
The fact that it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's barely stepped in there in his life.
Yeah, most of the Roma population in Brno probably live there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they don't have it :D certainly isn't that I'm afraid to climb the street there tonight.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap apartment with good access to downtown, I'd go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and the mistress Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who's she gonna spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the adventure wreath lit their first candle, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen Dad's wreath, and I'm sure Lucie's got one too, and he told Lightning the saxophonist who so confirmed Patras' words that he often visits her.
He visits, but he doesn't live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada stayed alone after he left.
The Nightingale still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We just met with Anna, Felix and both grandchildren.
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem: Again!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem: Again!
But we kept talking, so it didn't happen Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy Dada and Lucia something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, supplied by Felix, who himself came to the baptism of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet the wife of Ludek Sobota Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have a soldier or a gun?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is strategic enough that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to take over this territory.
And I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know any other ingredients that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are short, and they can't afford it, so the firemen themselves and nowhere else is the high percentage of people who are trained to be healthy at this level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend itself is the only thing that goes on the head of previous governments, not the army, that begs for new toys long enough.
Record dryness in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst period of drought in recent years.
According to scientists, there has been a decline in mountain and sub-mountain areas, and a smaller amount of precipitation is also recorded where there has not been an emergency.
The reason for the drought, which is taking place in a large part of Central Europe, is climate change.
However, the way we run the soil is also what makes the effects stronger.
What should we prepare ourselves for in connection with the dry matter?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's gonna be like, I can barely stay on ice skates, mushrooms know what hockey is, and the tactics (as I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also overall havoc.
And whether you're a hockey team "bear Russia" or "Lama China" you lose two goals even though you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it's compared.
But anyway, what I listen to is Czech commentators who poke out, what the referees ignore, whether male or female hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
There's a controversy everywhere.
And the imho if it were the opposite, it is as usual, and that the Czech Republic has already lost more often than it has won, it would probably be the classic "vones lost" vs. "We have won".
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 1967 at 100,000, 871 at 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new diseases have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It's the lowest daily number since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain faces the "inevitable" large wave of diseases caused by Omicron, said on Sunday on TV to Dr. Susan Hopkins, the main medical counsellor for the British Health Agency.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Omicron infected people are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one has died from omicrons, but hospitalizations take place about 14 days after the disease and deaths about three weeks after the disease.
Head of British Labourists Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by having a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson's government defended that the quiz took place "virtually," through the computer.
But they participated in Downing Street, a group of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the Prime Minister's office is increasing.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson’s ministers organized numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial for Britain: Today, Boris Johnson won by a vast majority in general elections two years ago.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove it from its function as Prime Minister.
It's remarkable how quickly events have evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for an election in the spring that can end the 12-year-old government of Viktor Orbán.
It will be an election of pan-European importance.
How much can you expect to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be free, because they weren't even the last two elections under Orbán.
His side Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituency to profit from it, and makes more or less tricks.
The last one so far is that everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from the determined districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it'll be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
It used to be, not if Fidesz wins, but how much and if he has a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
That's a big habit for Viktor Orbán and his side.
Won't they try to keep the power playing harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've been doing so far.
Recently, an independent media recording of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér has been leaked, where the heads of secret services say that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Is that the new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I've been beaten quite often, for the last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad's got a long time, but then she's gonna bang extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I was very choleric, and I was angry as a little girl, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a spasm and was all blue, they took my shower two times to calm down.
Sometimes I had a training thing, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things with violence now, as a girl I fought quite a bit, now I'm going to hit something, and as a younger person I'm like, like, punching my parents in the arm like that (if I don't get too far through my mouth), so I never get anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent that's my explosiveity, but I'm sure the upbringing's got a stake in it, too.
I'm afraid I'm also going to lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think it's just wrong to beat the kids and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it wasn't "educated," but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe everyone's just gonna fuck up, maybe it's not possible not to delay their kids a little bit, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws are to be clear and clear.
Cunts, then, would be called those that make up laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of outage?
Is it really possible to expect that people want and buy a product and you have something to pay for a mortgage?
Kočner's monstrosity world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial with the killers of the journalist Kuciaka?
In Slovakia, the main presentation begins with a trial with four defendants from the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
It has triggered civil society, but it has also revealed the practices of the accused businessman, Marián Kočner, and his connection to the peaks of Slovak politics and justice.
How critical will the process mean for Slovakia?
It's the press who's responsible for this.
How is it possible that this petition had a lot more media attention than the antipetitions of the dean of all medical faculties that came out a day or two later?
No, they got fooled and the company jumped it.

The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
Minister Havlíček's proposal needs to be substantially reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of a deep storage of high radioactive waste is still not there.
The legislative council of the government interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government after years of discussion.
Its contents are, however, in serious conflict not only with the communities concerned associated in the Platform against the deep-sea storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-government expects a stronger strengthening of its possibilities in decisioning on the repository, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation started and required by the Czech Atomic Act and European directives.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its Coalition Treaty, to recast the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process for the selection of the site for the storage site is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in a given location.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned prior to the initiation of the specific management.
The proposed proposal of a material intention almost completely disregards the public's involvement and makes citizens of municipalities practically mere statisticians in the authorisation procedures.
The design lacks system compensation settings for villages for the whole search process and selection of the site for storage, authorisation and operation.
The representatives of municipalities do not really have much of an opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a place to store.
However, only in certain procedures of authorisation may they submit their observations or appeal, but shall be decided by the Office or the Minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation.
Where applicable, the action shall not have a suspensory effect on the performance of research or construction work.
The joint decision-making of the authorities requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those where they have already progressed to allow storage, such as in Sweden or Finland.
Furthermore, the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and followed by contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, vice mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek site and spokesperson of the Platform against the deep-sea storage, said: After the ministers of industry, who would settle the position of self-government against state authorities in the search for a deep storage of high radioactive waste, we are waiting for a more significant turnover from the new government.
We offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Villages, who feel the same way about the issue of the lack of rights of municipalities for such a crucial building as the villages concerned in the selected locations.
The deep-sea storage platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's access to spent nuclear fuel management and other radioactive waste that will not be limited to deep-sea storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of the site for possible storage should be subject to prior approval by the municipalities concerned.
The actor John Goodman (69) forced to lose weight fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything for years in his lifestyle, the doctors finally scared him.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 pounds, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body caused the furniture to crack.
“I put everything in my mouth,” said the actor in 2018 in an interview for AARP.
This time, I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I get to the age when I can't afford to sit there anymore, he said for ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If this is about some text on the platform that expects the reader from the game environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal and maybe a university text, I'd probably be looking for a way to describe the boss or explain it.
There are more kinds of bosses for everything.
For example, a game like Dark Souls, etc. has several bosses that, yes, and so "boss" is something like a master / ruler of a given level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who are not at all needed to beat to make the game or level completed, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then you need games of the Half-Life type, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't make a direct move with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called at all?
And then they're mini bosses.
It is simply impossible to translate the boss, Czech and not even other languages (it is important that only Catalan, which the boss translates as the final opponent).
It's simply for a story or game of general importance, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all the previous and guarding completion of any level or task.
Peter's missing from London looking all over the world.
Czech police have also been involved.
The British police have been searching for Peter Srnce since December 3rd.
Czech police were involved in the search.
She's been looking for a 32-year-old woman from Hungary since December 7.
At the same time, Interpol helps the British police.
Czech Republic saw Petra Srncova last seen her colleagues on November 28th.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.
Interpol released a so-called yellow circular for her.
So Peter's looking for the whole world.
"Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information on the case with each other," she added.
The reported search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it's 168 centimeters tall, thin and brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse at one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman was involved in the search for Petra.
She was involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested a suspect.
But it's not clear who he was or what he had to do with Petra.
The Christmas Czech Republic is terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight drop in the attack campaigns, last month, with the attack coming up at the end of the year, the attacks increased significantly.
We recorded a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
So far, the attack strategy remains the same.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is to draw attention to the user’s name, which refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month had a dangerous attachment in the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the repair receipt for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan web browsers and other programs such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
Harmful code actively searches for stored log-in data which then sends them to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the upcoming holidays and end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, even spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically focus on the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November have picked up more global-scale campaigns.
Compared to October data Formbook slightly weakened in November but still worth almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook contained the most common attachment to the .exe file, which had the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
The name of the receipt still appears.
The annex in Czech can be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decrease and attenuation of activity are recorded by security analysts on the Fareit program, which cost 1.6 percent of attacks and has had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the past few months.
That smart-ass demo today that doesn't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
Prague's guide was bigger than the media say.
According to the photos of the parade on the waterfront and in my experience, the demonstrator is afraid of an estimated 10,000 people.
People in the parade filled the waterfront and the bridge and opposite waterfront communication.
That means a lot of people.
Some 4,000 demonstrators are spontaneously added to the parade by an unprecedented number of passers.
I'm saying something new is being born here, Radek Wetý writes.
That the continued dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led them to find common ground.
Only the anti-vaxers, anti-roofers and co. couldn't fill this big parade or pay it.
The events of Chcipl dog are of increasing popularity, it reminds me of a million moments for democracy inside out.
Sometimes I feel like they're renting the same stage and technique.
It's hard to tell what kind of dissatisfaction could be offset not only by the cash supply, but also by whether a three-dose vaccine from Pfizer would not become a square or more dose.
It's definitely not going to be the left or the middle movement, you bet.
The triple vaccine will almost certainly become multidose, because it is obvious that we will have to be vaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant actions of scientists, which humanity is rightfully proud of.

The "secret" footage is a global hit.
During the weekend in Britain, concerns about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech Republic were growing, followed by London police for several days.
Petra Srnc was last seen two weeks ago when she went home to the south of the British metropolis from work.
In addition to the police, the former employer or MP representing part of London, she has been calling for information about a child hospital worker.
"The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior at all, and we are starting to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the Metro Police Department in Lambeth, where Srncová worked in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and she simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her missing Czech Republic, around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday 28 November, she left work and headed home to Camberwell.
She was reportedly seen on the bus about half an hour later.

In Ústí nad Labem the zela moon hole in the road in the form of a canal without hatch.
It was life.
The magistrate referred complaints to the ŘSD, to which the road belongs, and because it said it didn't react, the hole of evil went on.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the ŘSD began to "resolve the situation intensively".
