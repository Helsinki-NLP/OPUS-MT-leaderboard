Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected the proposal to repeal the paragraph on the basis of the amendment to the Criminal Code, which condemned the leader of the opposition, Julija Tymoshenko.
An amendment that would open the way for the release of the prisoner's ex-premier was rejected by Members at the second reading of the proposal to mitigate the penalties for economic delinquency.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for the conclusion of an allegedly unfavourable agreement with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the appeal is due in December.
Tymoshenko refers to the judgment as a political vendetta of the regime, suspicion of the bias of the court triggered a trial in the West.
The proposal to exclude paragraph 365 from the criminal code, on the basis of which the Expremier was sentenced, supported 147 Members in the vote.
Its approval required 226 votes.
Libyan victory
The story of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it is after the war.
There's only one way to define the winner.
As it is customary in the region, Islamists will win the election, but it is whether moderation or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to Sharia's customary law, and we already have an idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, for theft is a hand cut.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from the faith await execution and so forth.
Instead of a person dictator, a company consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
Libya will have the order we can't imagine and we certainly wouldn't want.
However, our way of life is neither the only one nor objectively best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans mentioned above for a change.
In fact, it is a wonder that Islamic warriors have received gratitude from unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse is that from their point of view NATO was driven by a general from America, but Alah, whose size they celebrated in every successful intervention.
So when the winners are looking for in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of the dictator, removed the political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militaryly occupied.
So the locals have a problem expeling "the Crusaders."
But without the occupation of an oil company, will they have black gold for the mouth of Libya?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the unprofitable protection of human rights.
Unless we're interrupted by Sharia law-abiding people.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe got to the investors' point of view
The statistical shrinking went over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have published GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy has inter-quartically stagnated, Germany and France are growing.
But today, the debt market is breaking records.
Investors look not only at Italy but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, the two countries adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was better off than expected (increasing 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), whereas France stated that it appeared in a slight fall of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy rose by 1.5 percent this year in the third quarter.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated on a quarterly basis and, according to the CSO, confirmed the trend for a gradual slowdown in economic performance growth.
Results are worse than analyst estimates.
The most important events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year, but stagnated on a quarterly basis.
The German economy increased by 0.5 percent in the third quarter according to preliminary and seasonal data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union increased by 0.2 percent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The income on her ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
The proceeds of Italian and Spanish bonds are growing to critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The yields of Czech 10-year bonds are below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
Germany has voiced that the ECB should be the lender of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrates the 200 million
Football team did the hardest job of the season!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Bohemia and beautiful gate Petr Jirák won 1:0.
Czech football, with a large portion of happiness in the second half, has defended the luxury lead from domestic retribution and will not be missed again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the progress game in detailed reports.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech representation, thanks to the domestic ruin in the end, the great Czech Republic and the hero Jirák won happy in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrates the progress at the European Championship.
The Chernohorts did not get into pressure because of the precise defence of the Czech whole until the second half.
The losers of the game became Damjanovich and Vučanič, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the excellent Petr Čech, the Czech team will not miss the European Championship next year, and the prize will come to the cash register of domestic football about 200 million crowns.
A lot of fighting football has been playing since the opening minutes.
Both teams were hardly involved in the combination and played mainly around the halved line.
The pressure of domestic footballers did not come in the first half, because the Czech defence did not exactly turn away.
Iranian students are prepared to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield
A few hundred college students created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
By their gesture, they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program against a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday, at noon, the students prayed before the object and then called for the death of the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred students of the University of Isfahan, Iran, created a living shield around the Isfahan nuclear technology center on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
They show that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their lives.
In her recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAAE) noted that Iran did not seem to have stopped seeking nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities is discussed in Israel.
At noon before entering the Islamic nuclear facility, the students prayed and then called for the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at crippling Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, Israel’s press would also have been the target of a Natanz facility in addition to the Issahan centre, where uranium is enriched.
Meal of the obese child: he does not eat breakfast and dinner colds
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight, with 9 percent of school children overweight and 5 percent of children obese.
Obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey showed.
Once again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which it grows and the patterns it is surrounded.
For example, in obese children, smoking is more often than in normal - weight families.
The fried fries had for dinner the day before the research associated with an educational event called Obesity is not a coincidence more than 19 percent obese.
In fat families, too, it is not customary to sport, which is true for most of the school children's families today - only 15 percent of the children responded that their parents will find time to move actively at least once a week.
Research between 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the event Obesity is not a coincidence that supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
More than 12,000 school students from the 4th to 8th classes have been involved in the project so far.
Proper eating and exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically increasing number of overweight or even obesity children.
"Only half of those asked, for example, said that she had five times a day in breakfast-snack-dinner-snack-dinner, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper nutrition," is one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and no cold evening
Experts point out that there are important and relative details for healthy development, such as regular family breakfast time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of school children eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding that tens of households don't have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unhealthy fries are consumed more often in families of obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
While regularly more than 40 percent of the children asked about sports, their parents had less than half - 15 percent.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build from offered options their own meals according to their own taste and self opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
There are a lot of flour, meaty and sweet dishes among their favorite dishes.
"In particular, the great popularity of sweet lemonade is alarming," says the final survey report.
Pasta won just over poultry for lunch as the main meal.
But the children practically didn't want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes is low.
Indicative health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In a number of cases, there is a significant shift of preference towards the principles of healthy nutrition for the survey participants who have completed a questionnaire after the end of the educational lecture Obesity," the results of the project indicate.
Markant, for example, was the case with sweet lemonade, where more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children have also checked poultry and fish as the main food of the day much more frequently in the questionnaire and would limit sweet foods and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, claims professionals
In my opening article on how stylists were taught, I complained a little that there was a lot going on at the opening hours.
I had no idea what was gonna happen next.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar about how it goes on set.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "caught."
This time, Director Alice and I discussed (there is no one in the class) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly balanced figure.
And that's what the vast majority are.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy figure with no real curves, and someone's overweight again.
The stylist must know how to optically soften the wide arms, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
So we got tips for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, the bigger boobs and hips and a narrow waist, stressing the character nicely and not dressing too challengingly.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the sides is that the skirt or pants really don't fit, then it's worth having at least one of these custom made.
You're definitely not going to regret this, because the perfectly fitting clothes is priceless.
You'll feel much better in your dress than in one that's always moving, excavating, pulling away in your waist and the like.
The boy figure can also afford to wear clothes with folds, applications, embroidery or recruiting.
Of course, there's a lot of information and characters like that, so I'm glad to have all week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid, given the homework you're doing, it's too much.
Each of the trainers received an assigned celebrity, which is to come up with two outfits: day and night.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of a given personality and the type of character.
I'm gonna "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In a spirit of exultation, I am certainly better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained about 100 pounds (please take, in terms of exaggeration) or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut clothes out of magazines or search the Internet and print and then graphically process them.
Moodyboard, as the whole result is said, will also express our personal style and relation to graphic design.
Thinking about the graphic styling page is important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific tasks such as purse trends, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
On Saturday, three guests from the field prepared a lecture loaded with information about characters.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a smart stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
The variability is key in this case.
So, for example, a t-shirt (or if you originally want a t-neck) can be worn classically through jeans and a shirt like a cape, but you can also dress it up on a bare body, put on a boat and take a picture like a dress.
Or just pull up the sleeves or collars, and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly to work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said James.
Finally, I can see why we are crushing all the lessons we need to combine with, for what, for why, even in fashion magazines, we are seeing something else.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have a lot more clothing than how many of them can be taken.
So at the fashion story, which will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "stable" at least 15.
And it also looks and works in a picture of clothes in combination with other pieces in a completely different way than actually.
So that's what we have to count on when we make an outfit.
That image and style does only half of success, confirmed Honza Pokorný.
All you have to do is look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miracle singer, but the image and marketing made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to the use of stylists services is rather cold.
Even well-known faces often consider it unnecessary (it is enough that I can do something, what I look like in the process is secondary).
And if someone is already getting styling from us, then we should expect that they will most likely give us a completely different (less) size than they really are.
Then there is nothing to googlyze and see if the boulevard wrote about the fact that a given celebrity has lost weight or lost weight or so.
Both Honza and Mario put our hearts together on Sundays, that it is not enough for a stylist to be fashion-oriented and to be able to compose an outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with people he dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To guess people, not to dare, to stand up for your opinion.
"If you're ordered by some manager to sort her closet and fill it with nice pieces, you can't throw out the whole closet and tell her, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things in there that you commend and recommend what they can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us specifically what everything must contain the so-called "plate," or bag on the square.
It's the one you put around your waist and you have all the necessary proprieties with you.
In addition to clear items such as scissors, hairclips or pins, there are also silicone thread (with which the stylist helps to take pictures of products such as purses or hats), special clips that we put on the back of the clothes if it is bigger (spits or other clamps are not allowed, they would destroy the clothing), or the stapler.
In order not only to listen, but also to practice something, we learned how to fit shoes properly.
Even when shooting in an atelier where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glueed and glueed.
We can't even touch our shoes with scissors so they don't accidentally damage themselves.
There is, therefore, a real need for skill.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation without reservation.
Because that skill isn't really my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend course.
It's getting more and more clear that it's not really a walk in the pink orchard, no matter who wants what they want.
At Need for Speed: The Run is racing across America.
Reviews
Originally carefree driving turns due to a series of completely unnecessary Lajdaic errors into a routine morning journey on the shift.
Although ambitions have been largely fulfilled, it is not valid when no one seems to want to do anything else.
The new piece with the subtitle The Run raised high expectations before the release.
He promised that the old racing series Need for Speed would again move a piece in a new direction and from playable examples appeared as a game that in the action race genre would not only be in the number.
We were also curious to see how they would catch the passages in which the main hero would step out of the car and run his way.
However, as it is customary for the NFS series, many are slightly different than we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole drags down a few unnecessary errors that have appeared in the series for more or less years.
So it's not even a mistake, it's a expression of some kind of incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are set up in a story whose lead hero Jack has some personal problems and as a solution he offers to participate in an illegal race across America.
Behind the wheel you sit on the west coast of San Francisco, and your job is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
It follows that each race takes a different course and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have a moment of feeling like the game's still offering the same thing.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a world-class thing.
But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains seems very pleasant.
Moreover, the competitions are sometimes affected by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught up in a sandstorm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be covered in avalanche.
Besides, the races are quite well placed behind them.
There are only a few of them, but that's enough.
For a while you try to pass the desired number of opponents (in principle classic race), then you catch up again (classical fight with stopwatches) and then you have a duel with a single opponent waiting for you.
The police will be involved in this from time to time, which is making your efforts even more uncomfortable.
New ones are passages outside the car.
It's more of an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help them by printing the right buttons in the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that these passages are much less in the game than you would expect (in particular, perhaps only three).
But as a result, this is to the benefit of the matter, because this element does not stand a chance of becoming annoying, and in the context of the above mentioned, it is thus one of the elements that make the game sick.
The driver's model is in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That means that it's definitely not anyone else's today, but you can't say it's a negative.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But even though we could find a better model in the competition, it still works quite well for the idea of racing here.
So far, everything is in perfect order.
But the problems are beginning to appear after a while.
Unlike the model driving, the model of collisions is not well anymore.
From the game of this type, we do not expect it to calculate complex distortions and collisions, but when practically before any impact into any object you have no idea how your car will behave, then probably everything is not fine.
Typically when driving or passing cars in normal traffic, sometimes you only lick each other slightly, but sometimes in almost identical situations your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even go straight for it.
Well, thanks to the system of restarts, it's not a big deal, but it'll blow your mind.
Restarts are solved so that if you break down or drive far off the track, they will throw you back the game at the last stop on the track.
But there are only five restarts available in each race.
If you exhaust them, you have to start the race all over again.
So it's more of a tool in case something goes wrong than if you could rely on it.
Sometimes even restarts won't help, solve them until the need to learn the section of the race from memory.
The big flaw of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, need to be passed in a specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit into them.
In other cases, you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This will upset especially in situations where you can see between two opposing cars the opponent will easily pass in front of you, while when you get there, there are already cars in such a position that you have to go around or slow them down.
It doesn't matter when you get to them because it's "counted" so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
During the whole time of playing, you will find several places where, again, no matter the time, you will always pass the same opponent in the same place.
Most of it hits the end of the game on a long bridge, where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get there at any cost.
If he's coming in front of you, he's making you look worse about the anti-driving cars, so at first you're probably getting a couple of times in there.
You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline, but the implementation is so obvious that it will relish you reliably quickly.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing fun and places are so much action that sometimes you can't literally watch what's flying.
And basically, it doesn't matter if the concept of 50 unique tracks, the ranking of races, doesn't matter if boredom has a chance or anything else.
An unconventional idea is to exchange cars during races.
You need to be careful with the petrol pumps by the roads, because that's where you can change the car, even though in the vast majority of cases you'll have enough with what you just have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Submersibles are suitable for urban areas, strong American freeway bumpers, and exotic supersports for technical riding, for example, by handcuffed mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand and fashion challenges, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common for challenges and story.
Various items are unlocked for higher driver level: starting with cars and ending with the background for profile.
It is connected again to the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other difficult-to-understand kickbacks is the situation of the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the subway tunnel (which is), where you drive it in the dark on the tracks (then so be it).
On the tachometer, the numbers are flashing between 150 and 200 km/h (or so on) and the set of subways bumps in the back and uncompromisingly scrapes you.
In the editor's office, we may still have a few days to discuss whether or not anyone really thought a little bit about making a game, or if the authors think we're really that big of a jerks.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in some cases even great.
It freezes to the point that in some of the more intense moments, the imagery goes down, and in some cases, it's tragically tragic.
But it is mainly about accidents with a large number of participants, where you would no longer be able to view smoothly.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a question of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible range of younger audiences, a soundtrack was created from the category "every dog different ves", but it can be assumed that for the sake of listening to music no one will buy the game.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so much embarrassed.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary errors, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best piece of NFS in the last few years.
But that's how the game works unfinishedly.
Well, I'm sure it's fun, but get ready to see that your mistakes are gonna crack into your eyes with the power of the airport's spotlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have a reputation for negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has greatly disrupted the balance between institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to settle down a bit, and before all the players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador to the European Union, Milena Vicen, began to give a sharp lecture at the Faculty of Law.
To what extent she takes her motto "Intelligibly and openly about Europe" seriously, she has already shown in the first part of the lecture that she has managed to describe individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that she could be envied by a number of speakers from the Faculty of Law of the UK.
Vice-President Herman Van Rompuy also praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council:
"First there was a criticism that he was inconclusive, that he was a gray official, that he could not play any role, and I must say that everyone had breathed, that he had done the role excellently."
"He is a man who listens to 27 Member States, communicates perfectly with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? Which number should I call?", i.e. a major step towards unification and greater legibility of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us sirens.
The Vice-President also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council has lived and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency called it a success.
The Czechs solved the emerging financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis or organised a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time then referred to it as a large negative, which greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, the 'frmol fact' was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being resolved today.
Moreover, the new Union budget of seven years is still to be approved, which is very much complicated due to the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and cost-effective, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which are less, all of this is on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also reminded her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: 'Europe is clear'.
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, no one understands.
How does a citizen understand that they really do not invent curved or round cucumbers, bananas in different ways, or that we really need to be banned from sirens."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than positive aspects of the matter.
She is also sorry for the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech Republic.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, Visegrad Four has raised the strength and cooperation.
"Believe me that when the Pole and Hungarians come to me and the Slovak comes, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what's your Visegrad Four?" and they don't look so excited about it at all."
In the future, according to the Vice-President, new hard rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States are mainly awaited.
As very real, he perceives the concept of a two-speed, if not a more rapid Europe, rather than a new "European Federation."
"We have countries outside the euro area and countries outside the euro area."
"We have a Schengen area, we have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that they want and those that do not want to stand away."
"These institutes will be more and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe," Vice-President.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle that all topics having an impact on the Union are discussed between all Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were looking for a word that would best express IBM's strategy, it would probably be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM has been a symbol of the technological revolution, a company perceived as being very present, and yet a hundred years have passed since its founding.
The first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already gave the password that a number of world problems can easily be solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a print around which the life of the future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to be published in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means long-term thinking continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values, yet she was not afraid to change everything around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the second century," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company.
Advanced system
Watson took care of his employees in the 1930s, like the entrepreneur Baťa in the Czech Republic - as one of the first American employees had paid leave, insurance from an employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and merchants.
The IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company has been brilliant in exploiting talents - as one of the world's first companies, it has abolished any discrimination, so it can choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana will replace the woman Virginia Rometty next year.
She has been in IBM for 30 years, she still holds the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called pits in recent years, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
No wonder there's enough ideas - there's almost half a million people working at the company.
An institution with a good name
A firm's firm position in the business ensures its strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," said the Economist Professor Harvard Business School and the author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps to solve business problems using technology," added George Colony from Forrester Research.
As the company says, the difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM - or "Big Blue" - has grown into one of the world's largest companies for her logo in the United States.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
He holds the most patents from all U.S. technology companies and five of her employees won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include ATM, payment card, financial swap, barcode or disk.
IBM has become the second largest technology firm in market capitalization (the first is Apple) this year, when Microsoft was first ahead of Microsoft since 1996.
Forward view
Not all products and innovations hit the taste of customers and times - IBM for example failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online Prodigy services or IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on the move forward, you cannot emotionally bond to the past," notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, then leave them.
Unlike competitive Microsoft, which is essentially standing and falling on the Windows operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM's sales account for the most important services, after about a fifth of which are software and hardware.
At the same time, in 1990, with more than half a share, he was the strongest hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little-profit assets worth $15 billion, and during the same period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
The investment has continued since the first time the modern financial crisis has been overrun by the world.
IBM acts as a reference to its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who has also increased the volume of investment during the major economic crisis.
So far, IBM seems to be experiencing an intact crisis.
The price of IBM shares has risen by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008 and the net profit of the company is constantly increasing.
IBM's corporate password is to change everything but its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
IBM History: From cheese slicer to space
IBM (International Business Machines) was established in New York a hundred years ago, originally had a complex name for Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
IBM took over only in 1924 – originally a brand used for branch offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later IBM was given by a merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technologies such as famous "tits," i.e. clocks recording employees at arrival and leaving.
The architect of the new company was Businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the Supervisory Board of the company until 1930.
Flint hired a rival company boss Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as her name suggests, started producing and selling all kinds of machines for business - from meat and cheese slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, he doubled his turnover to nine million dollars and began a large expansion of the company to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that, almost 40 years later, his son, Thomas Watson Junior, replaced him in the boss's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA to drive flights to space - to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "creature", which established the computer standard of that time, called IBM 5150 came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand bought a consultative part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and started to devote itself fully to advice and services of high value added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off in the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, "smarter planets".
It aims to make smart use of technologies in areas that are not yet planned and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or in urban management.
For the area of trade, IBM recently launched the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, besides IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is located in Prague and there is also a research team of the world level dealing with voice recognition.
Richta about an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtář (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtár (53) became not only a protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she's not going to wait, and she's made clear rules for her next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," explained Rychtařová.
When Darina Rychtář gave Bartos asylum in her home this summer, she probably didn't think how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved to her insistence after 30 days from Říčan, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, accepted her husband’s relationship with her husband, and now she even said goodbye forever.
I don't care who his wife's sleeping with.
If Richard and Bartosh broke up once, his wife will not be waiting at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will banish him."
"However, she will live to see him not as my beloved, straying old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," said Rychtařová, saying that she had already taken her husband away from her husband and insisted only on mutual kindness.
So far, Joseph's closing Darina's back door is fine with him.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and I won't change it."
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, gardens, real estate, shopping."
"Darina and I are having a normal time, except we don't share beds together," said the Lightning Knight.
If Richard found a new love, she said she wouldn't be able to stop it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she goes with, and if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all responsibility," said Joseph.
The worst women's habits: do they concern you?
If you ask men if they could name any typical female vices, usually all of them into one are very quick to spill them out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you know in the following lines, where there are several female vices that can perfectly pump blood into men's veins?
Shopping
Does your other half think you're addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one rag a week?
Do you like to buy and buy at discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women realize that they should at least keep their shopping passion a little short.
But tell me, who would resist it just walking around clothing stores, looking at each other's well-fitting tops, and then all of them (ideally in different color designs) try them in the cabin?
Even though it is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told yours to wait for you before the entrance...
Perpetual dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start practicing?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Right?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger gender is also concurred by the increasing frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women are.
Order and purity in first place
It's like an endless carousel.
Washing windows, suction, paving tiles, dust wipes, wiping baths - at least twice a week.
You're telling your partner that he stepped on a clean pavement, kids, that they soiled the scrubbed sink and covered the glazed living room wall with which you had so much to do with polishing?
In the event that you suffer from this "absorbing," try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated, and order and purity should definitely not become the first place within the family.
This harmless desire for purity can compromise your relationships and family well-being.
Peeling
"Throw the underpants you used in the basket."
"Will you wear your old socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you do this to your partner several times a day, know that you can truly dial him.
Of course you don't mean any harm, but you want to make everything okay.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to dig into them so much...
Slurping, gossiping
For some women, gossip, gossip, as well as insult, and association against someone are also their own.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with who, how, and why.
I hope every one of us has a little harmless gossip or we've got a glue coming out here.
The hand on the heart, it's probably all women's.
On the contrary, they are the gossips of the thickest grain, which they like and often gossip, perhaps despise everyone and are especially dangerous to their surroundings - especially within the female working group - especially.
Jagr and Voráček helped to win Philadelphia
The hockey attacker Jaromír Jagr participated in the Monday NHL game with two assists to win Philadelphia 5:3 on the ice of Carolina and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was announced as the best player in the game, benefited from a nine-year-old review.
Two assists in the match were also recorded by Jagr's teammate Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jagr claimed to the overseas journalists that he had predicted a big evening to Giroux.
"Before the game, I told him he'd give the hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel this way," explained Jagr, after whose action Giroux scored the first Flyers missile.
A little later, the second hit of the team had a Czech lead.
Worm fought behind Hurricanes' goal and presented it to Maxim Talbot's scoring rings.
The second before the first break reduced Patrick Dwyer’s home player in the weakening, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
The Giroux in particular.
After collaborating with Jagre, he scored a third goal, then overturned his missile in the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he is the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs to the best three," said Jagr of his centre.
"I never thought I'd play hockey at the end of my career."
"I'm happy for that."
"I want to play him."
“All those years at the NHL, my teammates have been trying to play me, now it’s turning around,” added Jagr.
Carolina made the game a drama, a goal of Tuoma Ruutu, and again Dwyer, who fought out of the shooting, got in contrast to one goal.
But Matt Read did not allow further complications, which ended the overnumbering of two on one.
"He has done a great job in our Pronger zone."
"He pushed out the disc, I took the speed and (Read) went to a more distant pole."
"I tried to hit him, and I'm glad it worked out," he described the last goal of the game from his point of view Voráček.
Philadelphia won the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not play the game against Buffalo, in the second third he resigned due to injuries in the upper body.
Candiens lost two goal lines next to an experienced barrel and lost after a 2:3 penalty shot.
One of their raids hasn't changed Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach, rather than the lost points, was grounded by a large marshmallow in the back row, while the game was only played by five defenders.
"It's bad."
"We only played the game with one experienced player, the rest were young men."
"But there is nothing to be done about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The changeover was on us and we couldn't resist."
"We were supposed to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
We had gaps in that," added one of P.K. Subban's defenders.
Czech goaltender Andrew Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions to the win of 5:2 over Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters have been divided into goals by Jets, who have interrupted the five-game series of losses.
How Travel Prices Developed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were authorised in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At the time, travel agencies sold in the vast majority only tours to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sococa in Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when the possibility to travel to Yugoslavia was also possible, but then the Yugoslav regime joined the West and the journeys of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were then very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that it was not possible for citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakians too) to travel freely individually even within socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise the individual journey was not possible.
The travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand the front overnight with a sleeping bag or to have a "good friend" in the travel agency.
Even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for the journey to the West without a foreign promise.
However, by far the most often Czechs spent their holidays in the country, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs have acquired and this habit still survives today.
The Czech travel has been experiencing a real revolution since 1989.
While the holidays in the NDR or Bulgaria were our maximum until 1989, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we no longer realize today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely to the most popular Croatia by 1989, because it was a part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right at the end of the 1990s, visa waivers to neighbouring Western European countries took place, starting with a huge wave of short-term visits mainly in Austria and Germany.
Czechoslovakians couldn't take a long trip to the West, everyone wanted to take a look at it for a while.
For example, in Paris, the Czechs’ tours in tent parks slept, because our incomes did not allow us to pay for the hotel or guest house.
The typical feature of Czech travel was the carrying of own food, canned food, salami, etc. at this time to save itself.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely changeable Czech crown, which finally allowed our tourists to buy the Western currency freely after many decades.
However, our standard of living and with that, average wages increased, resulting in a further important moment around 1997.
Due to increased demand for travel, travel agencies have regularly started to prepare tours by charter air connections since 1997, making air tours incredibly cheaper thanks to the possibility of contracting quantitative discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had already visa-free contact to practically all the advanced countries of the world, except the US, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutional travel occurred right in 2000, when due to considerable demand was issued from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to the exoticy, it was to Thailand.
From this year onwards they leave with Czech tourists direct charters to warm far countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are now visiting about 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutional development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US cancelled a visa for Czech tourists, and this brought our country to the forefront of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent for the first time in history more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and spent for the first time in history for one foreign holiday, including the cost of stay more than 15 thousand CZK per person.
The general meeting is to find the chairman, but again, there's a heel.
Almost five months is Czech football without the President and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting that will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement under which electoral order it will proceed.
Without it, it will not even begin to vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Henry Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík have an interest in leading Czech football.
Hašek resigned in June, and on his departure he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead the football in the future.
But in the Hašk era, football slid back to the fasts between the two union chambers that couldn't agree on a common candidate.
It all showed up on September 16 when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the general meeting came to the National House in Prague in Smíchov for nothing, because the meeting was blocked and it was not just a choice.
For there has not been a consensus between who has the right to vote at the assembly - whether only the statutory representatives or also the officials of the full authority.
At this point, a partial agreement has occurred since then, which has helped with the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, according to which it is not possible to represent on the basis of power of attorney.
But there are still disputes about the electoral order.
He did not bring into the situation much too clearly the executive committee, which, in its meetings, whether proper or extraordinary, is essentially nothing else.
The view of the option has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how do you proceed in round 3 to avoid the possibility of heel?
"The dispute is whether to follow the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, one of the candidates who will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Morava is allegedly willing to go to a concession to win a candidate who will receive a higher percentage of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech party advocates the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the predominance in this percentage.
"However, this would then leave the sense of the two previous rounds, it would completely contradict the two-chamber concept," understands the objections of the Moravian Party Freedom, according to which it would be best not to bend and vote according to the applicable statutes.
This is a bit surprising for Tomáš Paclík, even though it is estimated that the Electoral Rules are the most suitable for Pelt from all candidates.
"I wish it would be up to the maximum by statute."
"In order not to invent any substitute nonsense like at the last general meeting," said the owner, Viktorie Plzeň, who was running for the first time and in his comments, primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburka he believes that the new President will be known and believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All passion will calm the possible progress of the national team today at the European Championship."
"Fotbal will again be on a happy wave, he will be more willing to cooperate," means the Appleian activist, who has the greatest experience in football management at both professional and regional level of the whole three.
Rajchl's more restraining.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very fragmented."
"It is not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations on purpose."
"This can cause the blocking of the general meeting to happen again."
"But I hope that common sense will prevail," said Rajchl.
There's not much time left on the agreement of all parties.
Some meetings were supposed to be held directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality would be complete by then.
The aviation special, in which they were to travel to Podgorice, among others, Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, did not leave Prague for a technical failure in the morning and sought a replacement option as to how part of the executive committee to transport to the scene of barage retribution.
Finally, there may be a crucial meeting at the Ministerial level, which may happen on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to encourage the split parties within the strongest sports association in the country to agree.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also a prepared general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pack's going to fight for president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If the football chief of Pilsen Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate in front of the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have signed up for the top position.
"If there was a quality adept, I'd fight for it and not go to the election."
"But under the current situation, no such person could be found," Paclík said.
In a fight with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl, Paclík is motivated to try to stop Pelt, an alleged favorite, from leading the FAČR.
He also emphasises that, in the event of his victory, he would only last in the role of President until 2013, when there is a proper general meeting on the programme.
He would like to see in perspective an experienced and top manager who is not too involved with football events.
"I have spoken to some people who would be considered."
"For me, it was crazy that some said that at this point they did not even want to identify themselves with Czech football."
"I would like to change that look," he said.
He is said to be most concerned with Pelt's connection with the president of the Pilsen Regional Football Union, Roman Berbra, a man with a controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general meeting.
It's so unacceptable for Pack to stand in a presiding position.
"If he had won, the state of play will be preserved, and nothing in football would have moved forward."
"In combination with Berbra's support, a skilled businessman, it would not be more beneficial for football," Paclík said.
He also notes that Pelt's name was heard in the hearings of an investigation into the corruption affair, from which Pelt came out unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's football would bring."
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is also taking into account his former statement that "he would sell the Plzeň club if Pelta had become chairman."
But if Paclík triumphed on Thursday’s election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another Rajchl candidate, who was supported by Paclík, is also considering before the September General Meeting, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to see."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him as the head of the representation."
"But in a managerial way, he couldn't manage the association."
"I don't stick my nose where I can't do it either," said Paclík, who in September raised great attention by standing behind the appeal of the panel of referees headed by Ludek Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Pack says he'd be in charge of the association.
He refers to his ability to manage private companies, and since last summer he has also headed Pilsen, who celebrated the Premier League Triumph with his support in May.
"I have the strength to change something in the football environment to contribute to its particular cultivation."
"To limit the influences of certain interest groups, which perhaps tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal committee, which goes up to disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not conceal his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan chief Daniel Křetínski.
One of the priorities would also be the strengthening of the FAČR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby with political leaders in order to get more money from lottery tax into sport.
"It's one of the key things a new chairman should do."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they must say where the money goes," he said.
As a burden, Paclík does not take his connection with the Pilsen club, although he claims that the chair of the FAČR should be "transpartite".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl and Dukloa in Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the point of hypocritically transferring my shares to someone in a Pilsen club and returning in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised a new FAČR statute that would exclude the electoral heel
Two days before the General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that, in the case of election, it would be necessary for the FAČR to have new statutes that would definitely exclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonian officer is an optimist before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk and believes that the election fight will significantly dampen the success of the football team today.
Pelta promised that he would focus on the representation and acquisition of funds in case of election before the September election.
The election before the last general meeting decided to go to the last minute, so the two-month delay could be useful for him to defend his idea of running the football and present his ideas in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels it's high time for someone to lead the association," means a man who is mainly associated with the Apple Club, but who has worked for many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is why he believes he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He believes that there is a euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hask behind the current election problems.
"For the June general meeting, the statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they do not allow different interpretations, we have had the President since September," Pelt said.
He just redesigned the most important document of the civic association to the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I'll take it as a personal assignment and I'm willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"It's a fundamental thing we can't be without," Pelta says.
They say he's still trying not to define against his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and he knew well that his counter-candidacy would be his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Paclík, who, on the other hand, left no thread dry on Pelt.
"It's been moving for over a year in football, he's had some successes."
"But his attacks were unworthy, and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That is why many of them now doubt his true character," Pelt said at the opponent's address, who said to remain faithful to the proclamations he announced in September.
His strongest weapon, according to him, is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to representations.
That should be the interpretation box of football.
"And I would also like to end all affairs, starting with the case of Bohemians or the reverberation of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then throw myself in negotiations with both the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the whole football," said the C.T.C.I.A. forty-four years ago.
At that time, he also promised that his coming to the head of football would not mean any personal cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarise myself with the fillings of individual employees," said Strahov, where, from long-term incompetence, there is comprehensible nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios, which will be accompanied by a general meeting, they believe that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only point of dispute is how to vote in the third round, then we can move on."
"Fotbal needs credibility, and he will only get it by finally having his leader back," Pelta remains an optimist two days before maybe the decisive day of his office career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR would start working hard under it
If the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic was elected to the Thursday general meeting by the current Vice-President Henry Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his election.
He wants to enforce systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football and to continue the work started by previous President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football to youth."
"I'm not saying I would do everything myself," said Rajchl in an interview for the CTC.
"I'm a team player, and I want to divide the powers on the executive committee so that each of the members is dedicated to a particular area."
"And I'm going to do hard work to make sure that every segment of football moves a mile ahead."
"Many people probably wouldn't be happy, because it would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
The critical atmosphere in the football movement was said to mean that he would not run again.
"I'm known to be doing 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people who will keep throwing sticks at my feet and questioning every step of the way," he explained why he hesitated.
"But a lot of people told me I couldn't give up, 'cause then others would give up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He says he's motivated by a continuation of the work he started with Haszek.
"In the last two years, a lot of work has been done, and I don't want to throw it away."
"There are processes that will not be started until a few years from now, and I would hate for someone to stop them," he said with concern that if another candidate was elected by Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the union could return to the time before Hašek.
"I believe in systematicism, and that's the thing I think Mirek Pelta can't do."
"In particular, there are people behind him who would play football so that it would only be for the chosen ones."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not the fact that I'm offending someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to play football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the chosen ones," said Rajchl.
It also refutes the claim that it would only be a Czech President.
"Although some people are trying to claim otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into a Czech and Moravian part whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would be no current situation where only three Moravian units are in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," said Rajchl.
As the president of the Pilsen club Tomáš Paclík also took part in the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its Vice-President, and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who considers saving tens of millions of crowns in disadvantaged contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lottery law as his success.
On the contrary, he's complicit in the fact that the union doesn't pull together.
While he declares about Pelt that he is "disqualified from returning confidence to Czech football", the other one considers Paclík to be a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he were elected, perhaps he would continue to do the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not substantially alter the staffing of the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to twist it for himself," Rajchl evaluates rivals.
The Most Beautiful Swimming Pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
A paddling pool from Ufono’s point of view, a luxury swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after exploring cities or letting his tired legs rest in a thermal bath.
The book will show where the wellness is most beautiful by the water.
When Iris Meder was released in the past one and a half years for the discovery, her luggage should not have been missing: her bathing suit.
Lying on the water, she looked up to the height of the artistic dome, swimming across from the marble putti (the characters of a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her on the edge of the pool and admiring carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she brought it to her notebook in a moment - with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have explored this way the historian of the architecture Meder and is now presenting them in her recently published book "Badefreuden (Radio of Swimming)": People's Swimming Pools in Munich, the historic palace of swimming houses in Schwarzwald,"The hard core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led it "The route to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
It's not too much of a sport, says Meder - it's something else in the water.
It's just that fans of swimming must settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners of health can breathe the sauce of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the swimming pools must always be so ugly," says Mrs Meder in Vienna.
"So I started gathering nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Sneaking in the jump pool and essential oil for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it concerns all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real eye pasture: "The place of the floor is man in a spa water level."
"It is transparent on the other hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: high vault, varied tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden (Radios of swimming)" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis Wellness - but it stimulates the desire to jump into blue.
A remarkable specimen discovered Mrs. Meder's swimming pool collector in her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful spas, like the 100-year-old Šéchenyi spas in Budapest, she found water containing nitrates in the original karst cave (the cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in the building of the shape of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jaszbereny).
On the other hand, there are many heated swimming pools under the sky in Switzerland and Austria. While a person has a curish roof swimming pool in the eyes of the whole city, the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton can look at the snow covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the traffic on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the swimming pool awaits guests in Längenfeld: The Aquapark Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
From the top three open pans in winter the steam rises while in the background of the mountain Ötztalu to the sky.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool, Mrs. Meder's pool collectors rose into the whiskers.
Many thermal baths are smelled of sulfur, in the spa Arpad in Békescsaba in Hungary, it smells of heating oil to the point that one can barely believe that one got into a healing bath.
The smell comes from medicinal water containing alkaline hydrocarbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, one place was Iris Meder disappointed in her search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit Czech solar and climatic spa Luhačovice, she came across closed terrain.
In 1902, architect Dušan Jurkovic's proposed spa was closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the decaying windows of the red-and-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds grow massively between the tiles.
On the other hand, they stood up to the death at a magic swimming pool in Schwarzwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already had three phases of construction; one can discover not only the neo-Romanian elements that came from the time of its inception in 1844 but also the Maurian Hall in the style of Alhambra, which was attached around 1900.
Since careful modernization 1995 Palais Thermal has been a popular spa place expert of Mrs. Iris Meder pools, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's a bit of an exercise to combine such a diverse building structure into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
At such a palace, immersing in a thermal pool seems to be a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank lets the commodity business be checked
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its agricultural raw materials trade?
According to information, SPIEgel-ONLINE commissioned Josef Ackermann to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the head of the group wants to draw the consequences from this.
Hamburg -
It is clear to the public that 84% of the Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials like wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and the other credit institutions step out of this trade because the problems of the poorest world are exacerbating.
This is the result of the Fors poll commissioned by the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity markets are putting prices to a height and therefore banks are complicit in the world's hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Chief Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Initially, commodity bets were thought to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk transactions have disengaged themselves from supply and demand - and have made profits on account of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann's criticism: He promised that he would test the complaints and said that no trade "is worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at stake".
According to information, SPIEGEL ONLINE controls the International Foodwatch-Report Working Group.
The audit will be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of the Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank’s representatives want to tell us what the consequences are.
At the end, the reduction in commodity trade or even total rejection could be.
Ackermann works with his help on his image.
At the same time, the Head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened his criticism to the financial sector: "Basing on rising food prices is particularly drastically showing how unscrupulously the banks are harming the general welfare today."
Have Ackermann as the highest bank lobbyist fulfil his duties.
"Deutsche Bank must cross off its portfolio all items for which money is used for food-price bets", said Bode.
"Indifferently, whether Mr Ackermann is hungry people or a reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's point of view seems surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the company's boss would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before he left the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board would not go to the Supervisory Board.
By turning away from the disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And the possible losses don't have to worry about - he should be able to handle that eventually by his successor.
Any other investment in raw materials would be denunciated
Foodwatch is trying to keep high pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which Institut Forsa questioned 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is just 11 percent that it considers it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments with which food prices bets are linked.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they had learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: Everyone else would have testified as a result of the survey all the investments in which the money is drained into speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn known to such a bank, 49 percent say that they will think about decommissioning their account and move on to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Moved pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endem: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 won prices, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and dissolved.
It is now being reopened as an exhibition house.
When it is hot for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials that are typical of believing in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is an excellent and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and highly functional steel and glass structure.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He celebrated the architect so that he also built a pavilion of Austria for the next world show.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palmp plus as the key made by the side construction in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its as a temporary exhibition building designed pavilion after the world exhibition was placed in Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Südbhnhof (South Station), renovated and in it 1962 opened the Museum of the 20th Century - it was named "The House of the 20th Century".
But the building was suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Yet, it was used until the present art was in Vienna for a new stand.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, now bears the name "The House of the 21st Century" and will be used as the Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening the Museum Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, will open the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery, was promoted.
Husslein-Arco, a prominent art historian, a young figure skater, later at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of Musea Moderny Salzburg, has committed a strong reconstruction with politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsor money and determined use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Zdruba should be displayed to the same name foundation, there should be a café and bookstore, and an office building must have been built to do so.
Strict surveillance, low budget.
Krischanitz was then an ideal cast.
Not only did he carefully reconstruct and extend the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but he studied at Schwanzer University of Technology Vienna and the pavilion was for him "an extremely important place", where he "although every weekend" looked at the exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which already at its relocation to Vienna and the change of use lost to its generosity and ease.
During the current reconstruction there were much bigger problems: The building was a "chatapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The glass facade window profiles were replaced with glass fibers reinforced with insulation glass and glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
The cold bridges-steel beams have been strengthened or replaced, and the asbestos-filled ceilings have been replaced.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, the illuminated lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, the entrance leads to the bridge - almost new construction, but still lofty Schwanzer Hall.
The original entrance door remained preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion red brown tone.
And the kinosal is even the same as it used to be.
All under strict supervision of the monumental office and low budget.
"Sometimes it had to be found material that is good and cheap and also liked the monumental office," says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
The trouble was said to be with the pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical "drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awake proper self-confidence".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, because there has been a urbanist happy coincidence: In a circle around Schweizer Garten, a completely new "City Quarter near the Main Railway Station" is being created with office and residential buildings.
And perhaps there will be another lucky chance: The 21st century House could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already dealing with the city's neighbourhood at the Schweizer Garten site.
The track plans a package for the winter crisis at a million-dollar rate
The runway has sprung up a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter season.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn issues more than 70 million euros in the newspaper this year.
The "Bild" newspapers had a preliminary report referring to the internal group plan that they were supposed to count on total investments of around EUR 300 million by 2015.
It is said that better use of trains and rail networks is to be achieved under extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway installations and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the platform until the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary switches within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the Chief of Railways Rüdiger Grube warned after a meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives against train failures and delays during this winter.
During the last winter, the passenger transport path had considerable problems because, inter alia, under difficult weather conditions, there was a lack of reserves.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Federal Railway Authority.
Moreover, the delays in the delivery of ICE trains are taken into account
The track has not been able to handle for years that ICE trains must probably have the workshop controlled more often when one ICE train at Köln main station was destroyed by the axle.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the USA
After the riot around Chief Josef Ackermann there are new tramples in the USA: Deutsche Bank must pay millions of compensation there.
As if Deutsche Bank no longer had enough problems at home, the giant has caught up with his past in the US: the Frankfurt institutions are paying $145 million (€106 million) in a single settlement procedure to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator reports a number of large banks that they have seduced cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they have probably reduced the risks.
In the course of the crisis, such papers have lost a lot of value and have torn the banks down with each other into the abyss.
"We are pleased that we could solve the issue without having to drag the parties to court," said the spokesman of Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any guilt by settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the support of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is competent for cooperative banks in the USA and helps in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
NCUA is attempting to obtain compensation for the billion-dollar damage suffered.
Now the settlements completed are the first of their kind.
The regulator was also attached to other large banks and in summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs were sued.
The doubtful mortgages are called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American real estate bubble broke down in 2007, it became a number of financial companies fatal.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Although events occurred a few years ago, now the banks are blowing a sharp wind in their mouths.
Investors and supervisors have filed numerous complaints in order to obtain redress or to punish mistakes.
Federal House Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
18 international large banks claim that two U.S. state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgages, were underprivileged at about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face an FHFA lawsuit, which is worth more than 14.2 billion dollars in total from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires that the Frankfurt Institute be responsible for "substantial losses" without, however, stating any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requirements as unfounded and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
The financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, an important American investor Warren Buffet has always claimed that he will not invest in the area of IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies will only allow himself to be predicted with difficulty.
However, he has now read IBM's trade reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and acquires computer systems for IT-department of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffet's investment is considered a fit for knights.
As a result, the mother rock of the IT IBM may now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett revealed to the American economic station CNBC that he had bought $10.7 billion of IBM shares since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett sagte, that even IBM did not know anything about his involvement yet.
He praised the management, which tried even to make good returns for the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centres.
More than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice and powerful computers for companies.
Buffett's been avoiding technology companies to this day.
It claims that it invests only in undertakings that it also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight rail, lubricant manufacturers or machine manufacturers.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns, alongside about 80 own subsidiaries, also shares in a number of big-concerns such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old master took over a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built one of the most valuable companies in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha."
When Buffett's investments became known, IBM's shares increased by one percent before the storm began.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total price of over $220 billion on the stock exchange and is treated together with Apple and Microsoft as the world's most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, so much Buffy, he wouldn't want to get on.
The founder of Bill Gates is said to be his confidential friend.
The threat is tangible.
After the revelation of "Bunky in Zwickau," Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
Newspapers even speak of "blood ideology", which is now reliving.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek one between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany, this report was addressed with fear and concern.
For many German Turks, this brings back a spook that was long thought to be dead: From the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there was no comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background.
That there was xenophobia in Germany, yet there was never any doubt.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a range that has long been unsupervised.
"Does he relive the bloody ideology?" was the headlines of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the "Sabah" newspaper emphasises that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police agent of the Department for the Protection of the Constitution, and they fear that the German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality Germany responded with discretion: She remembered the weekend by demonstrating silence at the Brandenburg gate of the victim of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politics, recalled the solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Recruitment Agreement.
In cheerful colors, life together was staged - as a history of success.
As a shelf, several Turkish media coverage works here: "The gift of Germany to the 50s" is the title of the article in the Turkish online platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murder series.
Nor will the issue of the letter "Hürriyet" for Germany take to avoid making this thought connection.
"It's starting to stink," is the headline of the column from Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasises that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the restoration of Germany were murdered.
The police procedure and its late success in the search are most critically discussed in the German Internet Forums.
Why didn't the German authorities come forward much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors are surprised.
Thus many are shown at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If activities continue to be so superficially carried out, there will be nothing left for immigrants except their own defence and arms".
"That's gonna be the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarifications and the proportionality of the punishment of the entire network is highly dependent on internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
Which means, if the internal peace in Germany is threatened, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
Photographs of the burning site in Solingen are deeply interred in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it more clear to the living Turks that there is a tangible threat here and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
However, assassinations have made the Turks a more apparent feeling of mutuality.
Do Not Repeat Past Errors
The Turkish press mainly criticised the failure of German politics after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a compassionate telegram to the Turkish state president, but he was given a place to represent Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, Kinkel, at the funeral ceremony in Köln, at the time, in his speech, he calculated the fees the Turks were paying.
Quite as if the value of a person was measured according to the height of his taxes.
The current news coverage of Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local state law system is.
In addition to efforts to clarify and re-evaluate right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
A scandalous bank near Lake Curyš
Europe’s most adventurous bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered almost bankruptcy during the financial crisis, and since then it has been sliding from one crisis to another.
Now some German is going to make up for it.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his noisy departure from the head of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that he would enter almost the same spectacular new employment: President of the Board of Management of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber enjoyed publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and said friendly comments to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached a turntable."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it was clear that everything would turn out differently.
One UBS dealer in London went around all the bank's security systems and wasted around EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the Board of Directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland's recognized banker, had to leave.
The president of the Board of Directors of the UBS has been burned since then, and everyone asks, "When is Axel Weber finally coming?"
It has already become known that Weber bank since February 2012 may advise.
And the Presidency of the Governing Board will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough on Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an issue banker, and he certainly needs time to work.
At one point she will take responsibility for the bank’s strategy, which once again proved that she deserves the title of the "Banka of the Biggest scandals in Europe"
For the UBS is a huge one - until recently it has been the world's largest asset manager - and has been sliding for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, so it seems, a proud Swiss bank won't be spared.
It started out as a financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid, but also a clever asset manager combines with ambitious goals: it also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So she managed UBS 2007 on the one hand with $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, she went to the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
The former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich Hans Geiger tells us: "I have always referred UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, you ask, "How could I have been so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
For the first time in 2007, it was clear that something had gone wrong at the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli’s head of the board resigned surprisingly, which was still considered to be a highly intelligent and genius banker.
A few months later, he knew why he left.
The bank's investment division wasted Subprime licenses and had to write off billions.
In order to make it steady, UBS has a real capital increase of 13 billion francs.
In turn, it found real investors, but such as would have been the case recently: the opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that a person didn't even know its name.
But that was just the first hit.
It developed worse in April 2008.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the President of Marcel Ospel's Management Board, 2006 the second best-paid management board of Switzerland, resigned.
A disaster followed in October 2008: UBS had to be rescued by the State due to its misinvestments in the financial crisis.
The National Bank bought out of the UBS tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation put six billion francs on a mandatory exchangeable bond for which it could be a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks in its territory.
After all, the balance sheet sum of UBS 2007 was more than five times greater than the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
"One more time we couldn't save UBS," says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months now, UBS has been capitulating this in a tax dispute with America, and has shown its willingness to issue data from wealthy customers who, if possible, have reduced taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return to unauthorized profits from these transactions, including a penalty premium.
This made the UBS more or less open to helping cut taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the sacramentary of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it used to be.
Followed the resignation of the head of the Board and the President of the Board of Directors.
And an exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas over the next few months: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in the administration of assets to help cut tax.
And just when it got a little calm again, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered, this unfortunate business anabsis coming in: The only dealer wasted EUR 1.7 billion before the bank noticed that there was something wrong.
And it is clear: the risk management in investment banking is probably still not working.
"The case of Adoboli probably found that the risk control had changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz, Professor of Finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zürich.
The financial director of the large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not manage to control the risks."
After all, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers developed a long time ago, to become guardians of the great assets of the world: no too much risk, but too much security for money - also from this side the Alpine Republic collapsed again.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol for the unshaking reliability of Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich are still suitable for the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in the Curian Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curysian Lake, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss Mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the leases of the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry as Tiffany's are here among the Swiss traditional shops as the Sprüngli Confectionery.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been established here: from the National Bank to the Palast der Credit Suisse to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered by a heavy, rotating door.
Inside there are walls surrounded by marble, there are huge leather chairs in front of them, next to the bank's logo a big guide to "seif".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank by both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes - they suppressed or betrayed as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
He wouldn't want to read his name in the paper, he would end up closing, like all Swiss bankers, including both big banks.
UBS seems to have grown too much, finding out - especially in investment banking, where the Anglossas have expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have anything to say anymore.
"And if they had, they would have adapted to the ways of Anglo-Saxon."
Indeed, it was an Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, caused it high profits at first, and then a disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money as Schweizer Großbank in the jungle around Subprime.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven-million-dollar country on the largest rescue event in the history of its nation", writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros were approved by politicians to save the large bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
When talking to Swiss bankers, they see a problem in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks merged into a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and was growing further and further.
In doing so, it was helpful for both different bank predecessors of UBS to complement themselves: One rich, but sleepy bank in Zurich with a center of gravity in the administration of property and poorer, but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came in favour of a lot of money that could have been used to spin the big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a team of the future," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who manages feelings around the stomach, which has been developed from banking science to the top."
But I hear Opel was counting on Wuffli to end it.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "I think he thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
The pride preceded the fall.
UBS staff clearly remembers the meetings of executives at which Wuffli’s company boss repeated the same password again: To knock Goldman Sachs off the throne down.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She reported "League Tables", a sequencer that documented the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS tried to put it all up.
She's done a few steps.
In the foreign exchange and share trade, she participated in the game entirely upstairs.
Business advisers, however, stress one weakness: In the international interest trade, in the words of the bankers, Fixed Income, there is probably a great deal of distance behind the largest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided to an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
The hungry after growth invested both the bank itself and its own fund to ensure the risk of US investments in the Subprime.
It developed into a massive machine that changed the securities into American mortgage loans and transferred further - but it also kept its own risks.
Also, when the other banks were looking for a way out.
"In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it," says bank expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than they thought.
UBS positions have become a catapult seat and continue to swing.
Whoever runs the big bank now has almost incompetent work.
They need to find a strategy for the bank that all the close business models have disappeared.
The banker Geiger has already come up with an idea: No more investment banking, no more focus on property management, no more return to Swiss roots.
Even so, the bank (still) does not want to go.
But investment banking is supposed to be going down strongly, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti's new chief bank wants to present its future strategy to the world.
In fact, 51-year-old Swiss Italy was understood only as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he argued: He is supposed to run UBS business in the long term, as reported by the Kurdish bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank back in the mid-1990s.
3500 seats crossed.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are questions Axel Weber is already asking.
Publicly, however, she only says that she and her lady will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs the stock market in the USA.
The threatening recession in Europe has removed American investors from their courage to start the week.
The change in government in Athens and Rome has not achieved its intended impact.
The subdued production of industry on the continent choked the hope of stabilising the debt crisis.

The Italian and Greek glass last week was considered half full, not half empty - now the problems have penetrated again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, the financial values were on the sales list.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard values recorded a decrease of 0.6 per cent at 12.078 points to terminate trading.

In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
"We are not an island, but an addict," said Steve Goldman of Goldman.
Europe will not recover so quickly from the recession, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
The legend of investing Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: he said in one CNBC-interview that it would probably not yet be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too early in his point of view to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the old principle for decades and joined the American technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion at IBM strengthened the share rate of the traditional company and let it against the trend in the course of trading first quote almost one percent higher.

Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places the ravens of the field are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be evicted from cities, says experts.
Some people like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been part of the city’s image for centuries, yet some municipalities are gathering complaints about the impurity and noise caused by animals.
However, there is no 'problem birds' in sight yet.
The ravens of the field may no longer be evicted from the cities, the experts declared at the first symposium on crows in East Africa's Leer.
That is where experts from all over the Federal territory consulted on possible starting points.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
The problems of the cities also resulted from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is about increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing construction and cutting down typical trees to nest birds make life harder.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are in the Westphalia Soest, in the northwest, among others, in the Jever, Diephol and Achim near Brem and in Leer.
There, in 2005, the disputed project of mass killing of crows in the rural district caused negative headlines.
Critics have identified the capture of animals into bird traps and the killing of sticks as particularly brutal.
"Normal banishment, extermination, nothing brings," the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leer found out so much.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting trees often has undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies splinter and divide into different places."
Squeaking is only possible as an exception to hospitals, homes of pensioners or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities could not be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
The combination of expeling animals from sensitive residential areas and attracting them to other places is conceivable.
"Information board instead of chain saws" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One stroke in the face can eventually best stop self-confidence."
Mrs Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein ascherberg's learning path, on which information tables provide lessons on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to be already accepted by tourists.
Also, Mrs Jürgens had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is about every volume of communication, they have much to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Ravens use not only a tool to achieve pamphlet, but even as a tool they make their own tool.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior of four grasshoppers of the field as far as the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that stones must cause the collapse of the structure to reach the larva of the pier.
Without much training, they learned the size and shape of a stone to cause the platform collapse.
In the second attempt, the sly crows had to solve a more enticing problem.
In a vertically built cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a larva of piers.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with their beak.
But the researchers put pieces of wire there.
From them, she made all four animals a hook, using it as a hook, to hunt the vessel from the tube behind the holder.
The three of the four field ravens managed to even snuff.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Boshans and the Turks didn't come out for the cup.
Popular Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland take part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-off games.
The two-time successful superstar Cristiano Ronalded (8., 53.) was led by Portugal defeating Bosnia-Herzegovin 6:2 (2:1) and after the result of 0:0 in the first game the fifth participation in the European Championship was perfect.
The Czechs had enough in retribution to play-off with the outsider Černá Hora result 1:0 (0:0) when the first match was clear.
Branku did not even Croatia with 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland reached a released 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Elder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored further goals for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg professional of the Federal League Zvjezdan Misimovice changed penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) doubled for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a yellow and red card (54.).
Bosnia failed already in the playoffs to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
Portugal has managed to start its own on the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters to the net.
A good quarter-hour later he showed Nani his quality in a long-range shooting, and by 25 meters he adjusted to 2:0.
In the first half hour of the day, the Bosnians had their first clear chance in Edina Dzek’s goaltender.
Former player of Wolfsbury from English at the head of the standing club Manchester City settled the ball on the lower edge of the March, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Finally, Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding stood in the center.
After the procedure against the Helder Postig in the Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.)
On the counter, Stark made a disputed criminal kick after Fabio Coentraa, which changed Misimovic with certainty.
But after the break, the European Deputy Minister, from 2004, made it clear with four hits.
Petr Jiracek finished his last doubts in 81st minute for the Czech Republic.
With this, the European Champion leaves from 1976 to the fifth in a row for the European Championship.
The team of coach Michal Bilk with legioner Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) had also been lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the beginning.
The goaltender Petr Čech prevented the possible own gate of Tomáš Sivok (9.) in the last moment.
Montenegro had its best chance when the duo Stavan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired at 40 minutes from the border of criminal territory just around the Czech goal.
After the break, the transverse March had to save the position of the already hit goalie of the Czechs of the world class, again reduced the attacker FC Soul (50.).
The goal was to clear things up shortly before the conclusion.
Turkey missed the football miracle from Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not cross the state of 0:0.
While National Coach Guus Hiddink has to release almost with certainty his seat on the bench of the Third World Cup 2002, the Croatians may enjoy their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
Before 31.000 viewers at Maksimira Stadium, the Turks should have a nearly fairytale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only a stick from a distance in the seventh minute, the attacker Kazim also could not hang the bounced ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia has taken more control.
They also did not get the goal after the interruption of Croatia.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, who was released by Dortmundian Ivan Perisice from 62 minutes, the legionaries of the Federal League Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni is going to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought a team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took care of the success of 4:0 in the first game by a preliminary decision, in 32 minutes to lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) leveled for the guests.
Ireland has been at a pace since the beginning, but it had to wait until 23 minutes for Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy to have his first good chance.
Only at the last minute did Estonian defenses prevent a possible lead goal.
It was a long way in 32 minutes.
After the failed defense of goalie Pavel Londaka, Ward was on the scene and pushed the ball over the line to 1-0.

SAP wants to double its staff in China.
The largest software manufacturer in Europe SAP invests billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, he said that about two billion dollars (approximately EUR 1.5 billion) would flow, and he told Dax on Tuesday.
"We will create other research and development facilities and employ the relevant staff", announced Deputy Chief Bill McDermott at the Beijing Customer Fair.
The population is now growing from 2,500 employees to 4500.
The number of branches of the world’s number one software software for businesses is doubled from five to ten or eleven.
So far SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Some 4,000 of the worldwide more than 176,000 SAP customers are in a booming country.
Growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group’s strategy for 2015.
SAP wants to increase its turnover to EUR 20 billion by 2015.
Last year the Walldorfs lost approximately EUR 12.5 billion.
Currently, the software manufacturer, who employs 55,000 employees worldwide, is doing as well as almost never before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities...", said McDermott.
"Our goal, with the support of extensive research, is to promote sustainable growth in China."
Massacre at personal level
The emotionally strong new book by Peter Englund entitled Beauty and Grief: The Confidential History of the First World War begins with such a long list of performers when you turn your head.
One advice on how to behave at that moment: Carefully pull this page out and make a bookmark of it.
You will be very familiar with all people in Mr. Englund's novel story and this list will serve you as a navigation - like a beacon - in moments when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, quite aptly, as "antihistoric work".
It contains several well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, it is almost missing ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, it explains the author, as more like "the book about what it was like". It mainly discusses "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beautiful and grief" combines war experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women, both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flash like flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the entanglement of fate, while others are quenched.
Mr. Englund's book is different from the classic historical novels.
It adjusts the idea that World War I was just about the horrific trench fights in the West Front.
"Beautiful and grief" is also skillfully exploring other places where war dramas took place: Alps, Balkans, East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve the problems of falling bee nests, must spend Christmas in the shade of the pyramids or face the presence of a fly tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning, it's a very touching reading.
The war will devour people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When the guns start shooting at a distance and you're the woman who's home with your kids, run away or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost nobody understands what's going on, even why the whole war was unleashed.
"The vacuum arising from a lack of facts," noted Mr. Englund, "was filled with conjectures, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beautiful and sorrow" follows stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are taken from résumés, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives can sound scary and engaging, but thanks to the integration of small moments and details, they are completely lively and believable.
Many of them are talking about suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Replacements, substitutes everywhere."
"A coffee substitute, aluminium imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "meat made from pressed rice cooked in sheep's fat (and supplemented with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato husks, shoes with wooden soles".
It mentions that there was "837 registered meat substitutes for sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds inner impulses for wildness and brutality, wherefore he declares about war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature, not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or a good book, and pretending that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbaric behind that starchy self."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
"When you finally accept the sacrifice, you would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, however, he seems to be "a judgment he secretly hangs".
Other remarks concern the departure of the old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
"The conflict has become increasingly economic competition and a competitive fight," says Mr.
He caught what he calls "a new species of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a dress cut to the ground, which he carries out his bloodshed without getting out of the table."
People act totally unexpected, meanness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexual illness from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The greatest example of this behavior was the trade in gonococok pus, which soldiers bought and rubbed their genitals in the hope that they would end up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate of them have rubbed him in the eyes, which has often blinded them to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Peter Graves' Swedish, the prose of Mr. Englund is swift, but not spectacular, which fits his human subject perfectly.
In dozens of small outputs it captures the way in which the war "has unleashed completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
Most of the best books on World War I worked with hints rather than a comprehensive story, such as the "First World War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussell or novels as "The West Front of Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming endings in popular educational literature.
But I won't tell you.
But you'll feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled a page from your list of heroes out of his hand and set it on fire.
After the previous mistake this time per minute exactly planned accident
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time the park Zuccotti should be almost empty.
No one knew of the event except for a few high-ranking officers, and the others were first told it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the forefront of the action, whose presence stressed how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
The cases of the last weeks, for example, when pepper sprays against demonstrators were used, were not allowed to repeat, thus violating the separation rules, and in addition, the wave of public sympathy fell to the side of squatters.
Therefore, police operations aimed at cleaning up Zuccotti Park from demonstrators started after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were inspired by operations in other cities.
Massive exercise in the event of crisis situations took place in Randalls Island, which was a preparation for the event in Zuccotti Park.
The leaders strengthened the so-called anti-terrorism training involving the rapid transfer of a large number of police officers, focusing on the city's Lower Manhattan area.
The last part of the training took place Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" someone declared to whom the event was originally explained only as "training".
"I know a few police officers who have also been called into this action, and no one has said to them that they are going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that he remains anonymous.
"The fact that he was going to Zuccotti Park was only known as members of the department."
One reason for the covert was a lesson the city had already learned.
On October 14, the city's leaders planned to clear the park, but then retreated from the plan because, once the demonstrators heard about it, hundreds of them were included before the operation started in the park.
Tuesday's events were attended by police officers from different units, including intervention groups from all over the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr Kelly explained that during the day a large number of people were coming to the park and leaving again, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when there will be as few people as possible in the park," he said.
Before the troops set off, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
Many demonstrators have scared the lights and recorded reports from the amplions.
When members of the order units entered the park in their blue windmills, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
The police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., so she wanted to give demonstrators time to pack their things.
Another team of police officers were spotted gathering at the edge of the park to break into it if there was a need to make any arrests.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Chief spokesperson of the police department, Paul J. Browne, claimed that this was for their own safety.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, and in addition, some police officers were being rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that the television cars on Church Street along the west border of the park could have done smoothly.
The police were moving in the western direction and intertwined with a thick mix of personal protesters, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing, followed by teams from the hygiene department, who immediately dug up everything that was left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were pulled out of the park.
The most irritable group of demonstrators resorted near the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some created a roadblock, and the police launched their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp chained themselves to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Members of the emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly reported.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police's statement.
Mr. Browne said there were approximately 142 detainees in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of the "organization of riots and resisting arrests," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, was the highest-ranking police officer at the scene.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, head of detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he did not participate in the operation management," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, were erected roadblocks.
Police then developed a protection belt from these locations even further away from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police officers were seen, many of which were equipped shields, as they pushed people even further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., a protester was spotted south of Pine Street, jumping up onto the hood of a police car, and a few others who released air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, a police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for redundancies
The unions representing hundreds of school auxiliary workers who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that redundancies were not necessary and, in addition, discrimination due to the disproportionate impact on schools visited by poor students.
The case-law is probably the last option left for the Division Council 37 trade unions in their attempt to reverse the decision on redundancies.
On October 7th, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the worst-paid workers of the city lost their job. Their dismissals were described by the head of the trade union as a retribution of the city for not allowing him to access the health fund managed by the work force last spring, through which the city wanted to put a hole in the budget.
City officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the meeting of the City Council last month, the Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the board immediately contested that the budget did not specifically mention the redundancies of auxiliary workers.
The representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday, they will call a press conference, where they will formally announce a complaint before the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the suing party will be eight redundancies, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the city's legal department, said that the city has not yet seen the prosecution, and that is why the individual charges will not be mentioned.
According to the draft complaint that the New York Times was able to obtain, the unions focused on the number of redundancies in the poor areas of the city, thereby supporting their claims about unfair behaviour, considering that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have already been denied sufficient funding for a long time.
They point out that while 17 school assistants in the Staten Island region were not released at all and even 46 assistants were released in the Upper East Side in Brooklyn, part District 23 in Brownsville, and in the District 8 and 9 parts of the South Bronx.
It recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their job, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty.
The public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year and the school also lost money when the city changed the way in which the bonus funds were calculated for each student enrolled.
In addition, the committees argue that high school directors could have been confused in a way that was written by a document approving the release of parental coordinators.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the event, i.e. cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school's payroll to a database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been fired," says the draft complaint, "and not just moved to the database to the position of available staff."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept a deal on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats at the Congress agree on something about a rebellion in Libya.
Before this, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States troops was terminated.
On Tuesday, the Senate's Committee on International Relations will decide on the comments supported by President John Kerry (Mass) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn) in which she should congratulate the Libyans on their successful rebellion and US troops for "stability".
"This statement we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who began to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate concerning Libya has been easy until now.
Over the summer, legislators from both sides have constantly argued with the White House about the wording of a series of statements for approval or, on the contrary, rejecting the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of US armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of differences in the views of both political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
By doing so, the US mission in Libya was literally in the legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama managed the mission, but its members did not seem to be irritating enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The hesitation of the Congress finally preceded other events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August and was killed by Gaddafi on October 20.
The Nato mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate may now be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations in its statement "congratulations to the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tenacity, which they have spent trying to free their people" and "glorify the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies, who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also 'confirms the US national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya'.
Will the new proposal be fully supported by the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators again be divided into two-halfs, as was the case when the proposal was approved in June?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), head of the Republican Party in the Commission, opposed the last version.
Lugar's spokesperson said Monday that the final version of the new draft has not yet been seen.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that requires a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on the budget or other subject on which the entire House or Senate will vote.
For the time being, the other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals to the vote.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution, which were presented in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and the Senate - and others are only minor changes to others.
Only in the House can there be at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment and another handful which would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially the beginning Republicans, who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authority".
The statement of revenue on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment relating to the balanced budget.
In March 58, the senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss the number of periods in which Congress members could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that can be President.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of supplements that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
A permanent proposal remains an addition prohibiting the marriage of same-sex couples and an addition prohibiting the burning of the flag of a state.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although the members of Congress seem to be very active in the design of various amendments, they do not seem to be significantly out of the ordinary compared to previous years.
At the 111th Congress, they offered 77 extras, while at the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales compared to the beginning of the 1990s, when, according to the Senate's statistics, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last supplement, which was added - the 27th amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"A beaten but not beaten," says Gifford in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after the shooter injured her from the immediate vicinity at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on a national television on Monday night, sang together with a song from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that more than return to Congress wanted to heal.
The "20/20" appeared on ABC News Station with Diane Sawyer, and it was obvious that creating sentences was still giving her problems, and she needed help walking.
The whole show documented its difficult recovery, which was necessary for the injury caused by the bullet that punctured her skull in the front, penetrated her left half of her brain and came out of her head.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
During her first TV interview from the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, she replied, "All right."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hour special of the series "20/20", which was broadcast on the eve of the new book of this couple, called "Gabby: Story of Courage and Hope".
The special's been tracking the entire Gifford convalescence since the shooting of January 8th.
The videos that Kelly made during the first weeks show that Giffords is in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across the forehead.
While her husband is encouraging her, she can't do more than raise one or two fingers at that time.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair and her therapists teach her how to carry out simple activities.
Head nod.
Lip sprain.
And then, her first word was "What."
Within a few days, Giffords said the next word, "a toast," when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a key role for the recovery of Giffords: The congresswoman sings on them together with the therapist on the tune to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview with Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, Sawyer revealed that she did not remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that the Giffords read newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who was the six who were killed in the incident.
The shooting is suspected by Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missouri, where, under the influence of violently administered drugs, he is awaiting trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Fear, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point his wife said during the convalescence, "I lost."
"So I said to her, "Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You're just getting beat up.
But you can do it, you'll get back together, and you'll come back stronger than ever."
Military troops encounter compassion rather than respect
The event was a gala evening on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines gathered around him.
Celebratoryly dressed crowd rose up and warmly applauded.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who held the spring benefit.
In addition to him there was also Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military troops somewhat differently.
"Everyone was introduced as some orphans," wrote an e-mail officer.
I'm sure the organizers thought it well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respectful, it was regret.
So the opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes celebrating American public.
The military is included without coasts in the praise for its victims.
But these praises cost something, soldiers say.
The public is acting more and more like they're feeling sorry for the individual in uniform.
"We are not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded units in Iraq and soon left Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unfortunate souls."
This topic is very sensitive to the military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil their relationship with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that had to face the forces returning from Vietnam was much worse.
The result is that most words of pity are spoken in silence and in private between war veterans.
When two sons of the retired colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat events, serving as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that their service would be looked at by people outside the army from two angles.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and amazement because they have defeated the enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
Others, however, will wonder if "the evil, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who was involved in the fights in Iraq and after returning he took up a position in Washington in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him had no idea whether he could resist the stress associated with his Washington job so soon after returning to battle.
"When you talk about your ministry, you must count on negative reactions," cancian taught his sons.
The concern of the army partly stems from American indifference to wars.
The successes in the battlefield are rarely gained in a country with little awareness of its own army, and in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan it has little of its own.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as usual during World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded the American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of events they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing increasing pressure to act hard against rape
This week, it will be decided whether or not 28 women and men against the army will be brought to trial for alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, they're prepared to sue hundreds of other applicants.
Private's first class Elizabeth Lyman was the night she was reportedly raped by her army colleague, 25 years old, and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she headed to the barracks at Miramar air base north of San Diego. After dinner with her friend ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join him in order to have a drink in her room.
"I had a warning light on in my head," Lyman described.
But the native Texasan totally ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19."
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just a few minutes after they walked into her room, a man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18th, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will be waiting for a verdict that could have a historical impact, which will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld will be brought to trial.
The charges state that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The accusation was filed by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer in February, and the prosecuting party had 17 members at the time. However, in the coming months, their number increased to 28 - 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army had failed to investigate, punish, and any pursuit of justice.
Burke says she's going after the highest-ranking army commanders because the problem starts with them.
"Armada is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent attempts to take action against such acts?"
Burke also claims that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of which could become part of the other actions brought in the future.
Her strategy: rather than pooling all charges on this case - she put all the eggs in one basket, as she says - she'll file complaints in more than one case if she doesn't need to put pressure.
The defense team is headed by the U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, together with his colleagues, has given an incentive to reject the case.
The court documents that Newsweek has obtained are detailed in considering the strategy of defence - in principle, it is that current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court order, called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries concern the military services of the defendants," says the document.
The Ministry of Defense has refused to comment on this matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women still can't officially serve in battle yet, it's just a speech: in modern wars, it's hard to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a team of female soldiers played an increasingly important role, especially in communicating with civilian women in the war zone.
Result: Between these wars 150 female soldiers - two-thirds of them directly in battle.
It is time for modernization in the army, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the Veteran seminar on Legal Services are suing four major military academys for alleged development of an atmosphere that promotes hatred for women.
Independently of this, the non-profit organization of the American Vietnamese veterans collects evidence for its action against the army. This action focuses on the diagnosis of "personality violations", which was reportedly found in the rape victims to have an excuse for their release - according to activists, such as Ana Bhagwati, a group of human rights fighters for the Service Women's Action Network, is a very common practice.
As early as December, the group filed a motion against a state organisation for dealing with veterans accused of discriminatory practices which were intended to take place in the processing of aid applications by persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
The Congress presented nine separate proposals, presented by a group of senators and Members from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Ministry of Defence's Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unannounced in most cases, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The report issued in March also discusses the level of criminal prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the military were brought to trial - half of the civil justice system.
In the case of Deputy Burke, the prosecutors describe the attacks only as the first of a series of traumas.
For example, a first class private named Lyman reported an alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was due to happen.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat details of her rape eleven times to different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She has undergone all the tests necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of the attacker was found in her bed from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing asking her whether she and her boyfriend were in love with each other on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify as witnesses to a reputation in favor of an alleged offender who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," says Lyman.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there on the spot - screaming I ran out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, "that wasn't his trial.
The Lymans ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with personality disorder, calling her ineligible for service.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without entitlement to the service.
Whether the Lyman case and the other prosecutors move to the next stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, the law professor at George Washington Law University.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to proceed to the next stages of the discussion."
But between them and the verdict stands the mentioned doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment that it saw the light of the world.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine doctrine.
The army has been behind for decades because their responsibilities do not give the same level of motivational incentives and dissuasive means.
He adds, "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
The only way to change is if good people are willing to fight.
In the absence of a hearing in their favour, Burkevoa, the plaintiff, gathers hundreds of other persons prepared to bring the action and works on other cases relating to this subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue, where reform will not take place," he says.
Or until we die, depending on what comes sooner.
The walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July killing frenzy that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack he spent a lot of time at the computer, chatted with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how can we find them?
Easily - just go on Facebook.
"We have realized that it is not really that hard to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of the recently published report of the British research team, which concerned European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, says Bartlett, that scientists had enough to simply use the advertisement on the site and, thanks to this, they have determined with absolute accuracy the desired demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million right-wing fans to focus attention on them and send them ads, but instead of inviting them to the newly created group or offering them some dietary products, they called on them to fill out a questionnaire asking questions about the level of their education, their relationship with violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from over 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It is a whole new way of carrying out research," notes Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: on-line supporters of right-wing groups are all young men, which stimulates an increasing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the screen of computers."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use this site to study everything, from health problems to social trends that hide state updates, wall contributions and press buttons "I like it".
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. On average, each of them will provide three different data every day, which makes this social network literally "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works in which the word Facebook appears has increased to almost 800% compared to the state five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them on the street.
"It used to be very difficult to identify when you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party."
"You'd have to get to the side where you'd never be allowed to go," says Bartlett.
"This is all Facebook breaking down - you're just going straight to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid the social-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren from the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who discussed their drunken Facebook outcomes were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who kept quiet about it.
Moreno proposes that students monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem cannot be solved if you can't diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We've found a way to identify endangered children that we might otherwise not have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The information team has compiled statistics on the context of relations and Valentine's Day, electoral participation in 2010 and the country's satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information they have had access to - Internet Freedom advocates have long claimed that the website should make its information treasure accessible to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I do not think that most users could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using the public facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it so that there was information between them and their friends."
Then it is also considered the question of methodology.
Even in off-line research, there is no guarantee that the entity is completely honest.
It is not possible to verify on Facebook how much information on profile and wall posts is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to be used in research.
"When you go to the real world and talk to real people, it's something you can't replace," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to the design of two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer during his first public hearing in Oslo, described himself as a fighter of "defence".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among Norwegian Templar Knights," he said before the court where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because you have been given a mandate by an organization supporting the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I confess no guilt."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could declare his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought in his ready - to - speak speech, allow his victims’ relatives to be approached at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for the next 12 weeks, prohibit any contact with the media for 4 weeks, and announce that the competent authorities will have complete control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 relatives of the victims and survivors participated in the hearing.
Some have come in the hope that they will be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that he is kept firmly under lockdown.
They all participated to move the case to early closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said the NRK commentator, one of the survivors.
"It was nothing pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I went a little further mentally."
Breivik, in a dark suit and in a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. At the time of coming and leaving to the building without difficulty looking the present journalists and surviving into the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge pointed out that he was not crazy, and noted that there was no evidence that he had an accomplice.
For someone, it may be a comfort that the attacks of June 22 seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
This, however, does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the nation.
"I wish she'd fallen like a monster, but that's not the case," said one of the victims' relatives.
"If I did, everything would be so much easier."
7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie going to the movies this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5th, the views of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear, and they elected him as his genius the greatest modern inventor.
At the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted off for a special movie that is going to the cinemas this week, the fact that his creative mind was perfectly understood by the commercial processes and the workflows behind his products will be for all Apple fans.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedant organizer and person who tunes every detail into the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs were suffering "the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] between the excellent idea and the excellent resultant product is still a long way to go of work."
In 1995 Bob Cringely worked on a TV series Triumf computer fools, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the shooting took place a unique, more than hourly interview.
By that time, it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple and had his hands full with his new computer company NeXT, and he eagerly watched how the general public would accept the Internet.
In the TV show, only a short part of the entire Cringely interview was used, and the original copies of the interview were traditional that they were lost during the transfer.
Shortly after Jobs' death, the VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly trimmed, that forms the basis of the 68-minute picture of Steve Jobs: The lost interview, which is heading for selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
It is surprising that Jobs is able to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview it will happen that between the question and the answer there will be a longer pause - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you can see how Jobs is perfectly considering the answer to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when he is impatient in Cringely’s issues and encourages him to get to more important issues and topics more quickly.
The interview was filmed before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, and it reveals scaryly prophetic thoughts when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read the postmortem evaluation of Jobs' career, but there is something raw and inspiring about Jobs, which we see here as a eager dreamer in the bloom of his genius.
He has his own vision of how things should and should look like.
It did not take long, and after he expressed his thoughts, he also started putting them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noticing:
How did he learn to run a business:
"During the years of business, I always asked, "Why are you doing this? And the answer was always the same: well, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, never thinking deep about business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing its efforts to simplify accounts at Apple.
He was completely confused about the way the costs were recorded - they often started with the inscription of "standard costs", their amount could only be thought of. At that point he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the commercial costs within a moment.
How he made the palace of the Pope:
Jobs remembers the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to hack into the phone company effectively and call anywhere in the world free of charge.
A number have been written about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as a tool of power, is literally contagious.
They tell us how they tested the devices using a pay phone with Wozniak, and during the call, they were switched from one AT&T network to another, while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a dozen times, we got this way around the world, so when we yelled at the pay phone, it came back a minute later from the other phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young, and we found out that we can build a thing ourselves that is capable of managing the infrastructure for billions of dollars worldwide."
We made a tiny little thing ourselves that could control a much bigger giant -- it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would ever have come into existence without it.
Jobs continues to describe a joke that almost reached the end with Wozniak. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, making the best of their appearance as Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke up to the phone the Pope himself, the couple would laugh and lay down the headphones.
How he fell in love with technology (and on the phone with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, looking for spare parts to build a frequencyometer, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a society was and how it was supposed to treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited company research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer that was ever made".
He was as big as the trunk, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him immediately.
As a teenager, I went higher and higher in HP, hanging around that computer, and I started writing programs for him.
How he invents innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about how he invents new products during the run.
In the beginnings of his career, when he went to sell a few boards with flat connections, a customer asked him to put together a whole computer for him.
At his disposal he had only 30 paid days, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember how wildly we were arguing... screaming at me that it would take me five years [assemble a mouse that would cost $300] to stop me from having fun, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable 15-dollar mouse.
How big companies breathe:
A long time before he led Apple’s resurrection, Jobs foretold that many industrial leaders would waver in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copies or printers, so what else?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so society can no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are in charge, so companies are run by people who are in charge of this, while people who are in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led society to its unshaking position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skills and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could've been ten times bigger than it is, could've been Microsoft in the '90s...
But instead of winning, they made money to lose.
How he takes innovation as an art form:
"Beyond the excellent idea and excellent product is a long journey and a lot of work... and as this great idea develops, so it changes and grows."
During that time, you'll learn a lot about him.
You have to take a number of compromises - certain things simply electrons, glass, robots or factories do not force.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and put them together...
Finally, it depends on taste - you try to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a way you try to project them into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of breaking the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked there were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and coincidences also the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they'd do amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opposers of the Health Care Act while their case was being dealt with by the court
On the day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would object to President Obama's Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm to attend the hearing before the court.
Last Thursday, when all nine judges gathered to discuss the proposals submitted.
One of the cases under discussion was a lawsuit brought by 26 states questioning the radical reprocessing of health care approved last year by Congress - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the action, but in March, a 5.5-hour meeting is expected, the result of which will further expand the presidential elections planned for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who stands before the Court of Justice and tries to obtain the rejection of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Attorney General under George W. Bush.
Clement's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations questioning the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which there are huge funds at stake in the process.
Dinner took place at the Washington Hotel a few hours after a court discussion on the case.
He participated, among others, in Mitch McConnell, the Supreme Representative of the Republicans in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: This couple of judges have been participating in the Federalist Society for years.
And it's definitely nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to observe the principles of conduct which lower federal judges are subject to.
If not, however, their conduct would definitely fall under the C4 principle, which states that "the judge may participate in the events which are directly linked and other organisations organised for the purpose of obtaining funds, but the judge shall not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor shall he be mentioned on the agenda of the action."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas and the two legal firms operating in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in the case, was sufficient to alert the activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to code of conduct is contrary to the claims of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause.
"The judges drank and had dinner at the social benefit together with lawyers waiting to discuss their case in court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines their feet with all claims of indiscretion, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding to their critics, and they also told them that they had no problems combining their judicial duties with group actions such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
In addition, the Conservatives argue that Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia have an ethical problem with Thomas.
Kagana worked as the Attorney General under President Obama's rule when the first objection to the law came before the court.
The Kagana critics are pressuring her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she fought so much for the law back then as she could now be unbiased.
Kagana didn't suggest she was going to resign.
Boeing has won a record contract for 18 billion USD jets
Emirates airline is ordering 50 Boeing 777 two-way jets with the possibility to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
But if the company Boeing Co.'s aircraft manufacturer and the price of these 50 aircraft together makes a record $18 billion, it's something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the contract: Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to the forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need $250 billion in the next 20 years.
On the weekend, Boeing announced its biggest order in history regarding the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 2 street current Boeings 777.
A sensational order came from the Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
At the 2011 Dubai Air Show, Boeing reported that airlines have the opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, which would increase the total value of the contract to USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8, sometimes also known as Dreamliner, which is proud of much better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines belong to the oil - mining nations there.
This means that they have not only money to pay aircraft, but fuel prices - mostly damaging airlines, because they are one of its biggest costs - are not so decisive because the country itself makes money on higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines that they could cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The Emirates airline contract strengthens Boeaing’s position on the wide hull aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS to its narrow, attempt to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
The winnings of Boeing come four months after Airbus representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor of the 777-300ER aircraft, would take place.
The withdrawal took place because customers required more useful aircraft loads and ranges, so the manufacturer took the time to provide the machine with more engine power.
The price of Boeing Co's actions increased by 1.5% to USD 67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president seems to have been defeated in the Michoacan elections.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon, from PRI, was helped by drug traffickers in pursuit of the governor's chair.
It seems that Felipe Calderon’s sister lost the governor’s position in Michoacan in a violent state election, and on Monday, she subsequently declared that one of her opponents helped to win.
Preliminary results were attributed by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to Faust Vallej in the governorial elections of the Western State.
"The involvement of members of organised crime in the whole election process, and especially until yesterday's election itself, is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in an interview for the radio the day after the Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the public opinion poll... confiscated the polls, built roadblocks... and let people vote for the PRI order.
The PRI Party ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its Presidency in 2000.
However, it is planning an early return to power and victory in the Michoacán elections is an important step in this effort.
The PRI Party hopes to win even in July in the presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who was leading the day before the election, only very close.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to accept Vallejo as a winner.
The third one was placed by Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which had so far been ruled by the governor's office.
Aureoles also refused to accept preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital, Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and encourages other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that he started a military fight against traffickers.
But the violence endured.
The mayor of the PAN, the supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered only a week before the elections, and many candidates for the elections resigned from fear.
However, however the results of the elections in Michoacán look to the PRI side in any way, the victory of the party will help to gain a new impulse.
The expected PRI party representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Wahington Vallej and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
The Bank of ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help save the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall decline in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of the economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of the Bank of ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing economies in the world must "do everything they can" to help quickly recover the currency block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned against the fact that the Bric countries [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are watching all European difficulties "too relentlessly" and said that Asian financial assistance combined with European leadership and resources will help to ignite the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So, anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis could be useful," said the Financial Times during the interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asie may be protected to some extent, but she's definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
For several months now, the European Monetary Association has been heavily tested by a serious debt crisis.
In the last few days, Italy’s borrowing costs increased dangerously and Italy’s and Greece’s leaders resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that it could bring the global economy back into recession, and calls have started to come to bring the emerging front economies together and help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds by the European Union's financial assistance fund, an institution for European financial stability - would provide more negotiating opportunities for the Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister for Trade, said that "India will do what it can to help the Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and drying out the inflow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we must maintain a high growth rate."
"It is not an alternative, it is a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that emerging economies such as Indian economies have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the USA, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain the aid to Europe of 1.2 billion people in India when 800 million of them live from $2 or less per day.
"One might find that the Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their vacation on the beaches, which would be difficult to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly-managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the crisis of the Eurozone was threatened by a "hazardous domino effect".
The Bank's forecast that between 2011 and 2012, 7.5% of economic growth will occur in Asia is now facing a "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He stated that vulnerable emerging markets must create 'unforeseeable spending plans' in order to protect themselves from the decline and significant outflow of capital from their economies.
Pentagon warning on possible cuts in the area of defence
Minister of Defense Leon Panetta put a lot of pressure on Monday at Congress under the boiler, warning that the emerging automatic cuts in the budget could jeopardise national security and create a financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend $450 billion of budget cuts over the next ten years, but it is now afraid of a further $600 billion reduction if Congress fails to conclude an spending agreement.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the whole department," wrote Panetta in a letter to Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress's inability to reach an agreement on the budget, and the resulting so-called closure will result in a 23% flat-rate decline and many new projects being stopped.
"You can't buy three quarters of a building or a ship because of the huge reduction used in this indiscreet way," Panetta wrote to the senators. "You can't buy only three quarters of a building or a boat.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civil servants, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also have to almost certainly send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care for our army and seriously damage its preparedness."
In the end, the cuts will also affect the combat forces, announced Panetta.
"Although the accounts for the financing of potential overseas war operations will not be directly affected, the operations there will be adversely affected by major changes in other budgets," said Panetta.
"There will also be cuts in the contractual staff, which will result in the delay of arranged contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"The status of paid employees will be reduced, from which also late payments will flow to suppliers and subsequent disruptions of legal and political support."
Both Senators wrote off Panetta ten days ago and asked him for details on the possible impact on the automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a standoff at the Ministry of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this hard measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panett's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign."
"The cuts planned are a threat to the United States' national security, which we should not allow."
"It will only be seen if Panett's letter and fresh warning will increase the pressure on Congress to approve the budget and strengthen the voices calling for the pentagon to leave out of the list of depleted areas.
Panetta has recently been more and more open in talks about possible cuts, even though he himself has moved to his high position in the Pentagon with years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was starting a tough fight.
At a press conference held a minute of a week, the Minister of Defense indicated a brief picture of what his department might expect - the shell of the army, which will, however, be missing the core.
"She'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like an ammo-free brigade."
"He'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without a sufficient number of trained soldiers who could complete the mission," said Panetta at the beginning of the speech at the Pentagon.
"She will be as a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In the Annex to the letter delivered to McCain and Graham Panetta specify how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late response to the crisis, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on the possibility of airmails and deployment around the world; expected unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the largest defence projects could expect completion, including those already tested, even those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, a project of the F35 aircraft, a planned new bomber, ballistic submarines of the new generation, a new coastal battleship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the army and marine infantry wanted to replace humvee.
By stopping further development and testing of the F35 aircraft, 80 billion dollars would be saved in the next ten years, but its supporters argue that this is a necessary further step in improving the army that the country needs to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A glimpse of recent headlines suggests how serious and ubiquitous lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy accusing several women of sexual harassment - both sides claim that the other one is lying.
The administrators at Penn State University were charged with perjury when they were trying to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught running a microphone telling American President Barrack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
A lie could destroy a whole career and cover up the stability of many countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately refuted by unquestionable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using his campaign's funding to try to hide his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that pulled around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in his role as a sexual attraction with Monica Lewinsky.
It's all about stories about cheating at school and at university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to look good on their own.
Mentors who should teach the opposite are sending a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many frauds are we dealing with?
Studies show that in one day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first encounter in life.
Determining lies, or "recognition of lies", is a necessary skill that everyone should learn for personal or working reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Charade, when one shouts, "I have you." The recognition of deception is a serious sector of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths have been disproved of lies.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're stuttering, stuttering, blushing, or cheating.
Of course, do not assume that it is somehow difficult to spot liars and reveal them.
The trained polygraph can reveal the truth from the sentenceal structure, minor facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent a few years collecting scientific knowledge from the extensive and developing sector concerning the recognition of lies and it is clear that uncovering deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can help you in today's difficult world - especially if your work obligations include hiring, organising interviews, negotiating or conducting people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them be alert, guide their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
From research we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men carry more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than to free people (all lies they say are usually "unnegligible").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behaviour of the subject.
It's called "initial observation."
Thanks to him, he'll have a later finding out what to compare with.
Notice the subject's body, his laugh, his voice.
You should know if someone is knocking his feet all the time so you don't falsely accuse him of lying just because he starts knocking his feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to determine the clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But consider it only as warning signals, not as proof of lies.
People who carry a lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their imaginary story, the tip of the shoe can shoot to the door, bend to the east, significantly change the hold of the body, or show "response after the end of the conversation" - excessively relieved respite and change the position when it is difficult to confess behind them.
People conducting interviews often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what relief will look like after it's over.
Also feel the language of the subject.
Famous is a story about Scott Peterson once overthinking and using his past time when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which led to a national search for her body.
Lying individuals can also express themselves in measure: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinski" or the difficult question will repeat the whole question.
The most common verbal signs are only very small.
Someone can use a lot of "relieving tongue" when they answer the difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best knowledge."
We don't know much about the facts in that answer, and it's often another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to learn the skills by which a lie can be hunted.
With these skills, one will have a better chance of not flying a liar and a cheater in his personal and work.
The controversial plan for the construction of the oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of delaying approval by the US government has emerged.
A few days after Obama's government threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thus sending trade unions against each other, but calmed down the environmentalists - the company that built the pipeline announced that it was willing to redirect the project to put things back into motion.
On Monday evening, TransCanada announced that it will move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project will be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska Government.
The scale of TransCanada Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the construction will eventually be approved, even though it will lead on a different route.
This notification came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it was delaying the decision on the federal authorisation of the project, from which it would not carry out studies of possible substitute routes, by which it could not be possible to intervene in the area of Sandhills in Nebraska and in the aquifer of Ogalala, a vast underground water supply plant.
"This is really a move forward," said Republican deputy Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably postpone any decision until 2013, i.e. one year after the elections next year, but the authorities refuse to play any role in the decision.
Obama described the decision in a written statement last week as a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed his support.
1 700 miles long pipe will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberto to the refineries in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil flow daily.
Six states will have to be cut through this path.
The project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by work platoons, which estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
However, the Nebraska legislators opposed this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and in the aquifer of Ogalal, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the environmental impact ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a small negative environmental impact, but the energy source said that the Secretary-General of the Ministry ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study and focused mainly on two questions.
Once upon a time, whether the lobbyist hired TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was the advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008 represented no conflict of interest in the programme.
Next, whether the company that was hired to carry out the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of having a toddler throw up on her.
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle furiously invaded the lobby of their Manhattan house and scared their daughter so much that she threw up in fear.
The performance of the hit singer "Lady Marmalade" scared Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "changes in personality, sleep disorder" and "increasing fear of strangers," claims her family in a lawsuit filed at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10th last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car, Roseanna Monk met her luggage down to the lobby of their house in Riverside Boulevard and brought with her Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a minute and put the baby away for a while.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "You know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes," and I left to pick her up."
LaBelle was irritatingly reproving a pregnant woman.
"With an aggressive tone she said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you think."
She got angry and started talking dirty - screaming loudly the meanest words...
She was carrying a bottle of water, and she started pouring water at me.
She says Genevieve got a hysterical seizure.
"I told the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter."
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her companion, who then dragged her to the waiting car, Roseanna Monk.
In the meantime, the daughter screamed so loudly when she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter asking for an apology from LaBelle, but they did not receive any answers.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokesperson are not responding to our calls to comment on the case.
The prosecution requires an unexplained indemnity, but the family attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family is planning on spending all the money he's got on a charity organization dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a schoolteacher holding an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of the government, Maria López Valdez increased unemployment and insecurity in Sinaloa, decreased foreign investment and the economy with them
The year 2011 will be recorded in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, which is called the government of change. This government has brought great expectations in terms of economic progress, but due to adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, there has been no growth and even a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the growth potential of the state economy, led to a 3.6% reduction in economic activity in the first semester of this year, since there has been a historical decline of 31.16% in agriculture, which has disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage suffered by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded on 582 835 hectares of cultivated land, 78.03% of which was completely destroyed and partial damage was detected on the remaining 21.07%. The main destroyed crops include vegetables, maize and peas.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state increased during the first three quarters of the year. From January to March, 55,053 inhabitants of the State of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August the average unemployment continued to rise to 6.19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed. Thus, the number of unemployed rose by 18,969 compared to the first quarter.
Less liquidity
More factors can be explained for unemployment during the year in Sinaloa. According to Gerard López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnesses to growing unemployment, which is linked to various factors, such as the loss of liquidity in the market due to reduced resources due to legislation approved by Congress in the context of the fight against money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally encroach on dollars to make money, invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Stop migration
López Cervantes stated that a demographic factor was also involved in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people who go abroad to work has fallen to the United States, because of the difficult entry and then because, even if they get abroad, it's hard for them to get a job. So people stay and demand work from our country, and so unemployment is growing," he said.
Reliability
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the people employed in the state work without benefiting from social security management.
More features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and insecurity. In this administrative area there are the lowest wages from all over the country, as stated by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5 352 pesetas by September, deep below the national average of 7 375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
According to the Ministry of Finance, direct foreign investment amounted to $630,697, representing a fall of 87.74% over the same period in the previous year, compared to the amount of $543,312.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government mentions investments of 17 280 million pesetas per year.
Debt
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government asked the state Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2,600 million peso. No debt gains were recorded by November, in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Maria López Valdés pointed out a lack of government management skills.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transforming Industry, stated that in 2011 there was a lack of reconciliation of the will of individual sectors, including the government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been really small this year. We need to work hard to get back the land we lost this year. In 2012 we need to double our efforts, we lacked harmonisation of all of our efforts, and in particular the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let us hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo López stated that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and reduced its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowing down of the economy, which did not quickly recover enough so that it could restore dynamism to an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year, we found ourselves deep under the expected forecasts", he said.
Re-definition of the mission
According to Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employment Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we are observing that work is being done. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the objectives and economic direction of the state should be redefined, because it is important to mobilise all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work ahead
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in different areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to establish a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration has shown progress in terms of public policy leadership.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead," he said.
Condemned for 8 kg marijuana
Resident Navolano was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fines for holding eight pounds of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was sentenced to a crime of health threats, namely for the possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican army on June 7, 2010 on a patrol in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite station 80 in the district of El Castillo, Navolano.
Dealer drove in a truck like pick up white. In the car in the shelf had a black bag and in the passenger seat a small backpack. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the man provided remains at the disposal of the Judges of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the implementation of the legal consequences of the offences.
Debt of project contributions
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, the rescue of public places and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be brought to an end or that they will be very late due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development stated that if construction work has gone forward so far, the government is now at risk of not being able to provide adequate supplies that require funding of more than 11 million peso per three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. Until then, only the Federation and the city have added funds, so it is possible that there will be delays in the implementation of the projects.
"They are supposed to provide almost 12 million and even though the year is coming to an end, we have not received anything at all. Even though we were already supposed to have a part in July," he said. "To avoid wasting time, we have started projects and continued very successfully, but we lack money".
He stated that last year, under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State failed to comply with the relevant supply, and that, therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to ask for a loan to pay more than 7 million that the state had not given them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the mentioned programmes this year, we had to get the funds that would cover what the State had not completed," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise by the public authorities regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that an application had been sent to Armand Villarreal, the Secretary of Administration and Finance, to expedite the proceedings and to arrive at the corresponding percentages as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven't even gotten a peso."
The Court of Justice approves the "end of analogue broadcasting" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, which wishes to hasten the so-called "off of analogous signals" and to implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
The minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mezo, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree setting out the steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was rejected because a qualified majority of eight votes needed to enable the court to comment on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree in question, which remains valid.
The motion for a judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility to declare the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of all questions relating to radio and television is a matter which, according to the law, is reserved by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cafetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and of all the actions described therein leading to the transition to digitisation.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into discussion on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify himself with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal enforcement could not structure through the general rules the measures to prepare for public administration.
"I do not think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority" and recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is federal enforcement, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analogue digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in recent years. It is related to better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefits of digitisation, which requires a decision on public interest: digitisation is not only a technical dimension, but "it also affects economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he emphasised, these questions "require the operation of the whole system in place, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences which the Constitution entrusts to the government of the state".
He recalled that many countries around the world had already completed the transition to a digital system and did so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical bodies at their disposal.
He stated that it was not possible for the government to impose an unacceptable decree which, to some extent, interferes with the area of Congress's powers, introduce compliance with laws prepared by legislative powers into the area of administration.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second seats in the elections of the governor is less than 27 percent.
The possibility of adding 'voice by vote' appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, according to the data published by the Programme of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections is less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been counted by 879 votes from the total 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the Chairman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures that should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his state election code or the electoral justice law, since the State Congress has approved reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire in this parliamentary term and Governor Leonl Godoy Range has left their publication within the time limit set in the Official Journal Act, with any objections against them.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative authority and declared the vote of the Head of State in respect of constitutional reforms for "undue and illegal", because it had no right to "not approve or veto".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied to the question of the possibility of adding "voice by voice" that thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council, it would be possible for the local electoral authority to carry out the partial and overall summation.
In this way, the partial summation of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the summation and calculation in the relevant box, or the President does not have it at his disposal; or if errors and obvious violations of the electoral results have occurred.
In addition, the total recalculation of votes in all ballots will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the elections and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition which proposed the candidate in second place.
A total recalculation of votes will also be possible if, after a proper census, the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate has ended in second place, the electoral packages for which partial counting has been carried out will be eliminated.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to the PREP there is a difference between the first and second place of less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been added.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé, confirmed by his family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his home town. During Monday there will be a ceremony and a memorial Mass.
According to the family, it was the Colonel's last wish that his ashes be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé.
After he and others died in the accident received the highest honors, the Bacio Cortese family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board the Mexican Air Force aircraft. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where the family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell was held at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, which was organized by his former high school students and members of the American football team, Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé. This is how he always said to his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire air school in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe it because they said he was even driving a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he just came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, like when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan at the graduation of his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he liked most in his life: to drive a plane.
They said good-bye to him last time.
With Felip Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honours that came to him to give up Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, leaders and students of the High School of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he exceled both in study and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the last days after he fell helicopter that he was driving. On board he was also Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and other six people, all the officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Saltillen native Bacio Cortés (incinerated) arrived to be handed over by the funeral service to the Mexican air force led by Major Jaime Martinez in the area where the family, his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, the mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers were gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on Cadereyta NL farm
A few hours before the investigation, the military officials presented to 11 persons who were detained in this area for organised crime offences.
The bodies of three men murdered by shooting into different parts of the body and the head were found on an abandoned estate of the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place on a 1.5 km road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
The people who were moving in these places noticed that a cabin with a beige coffee fence had been opened from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of approximately three meters, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One of the people was wearing a sports shirt of yellow color and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes.
A few metres away there was another person's body dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them were facing the ground.
According to the data obtained at the locations, all three people were probably murdered in a different location because the bullets were not found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed by one group of organized crime of the other and also a number of traces of bullets, both on the building and on the door.
11 suspects were arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defense introduced 11 people, among whom are youths, who were members of the criminal group, who operated in particular in the area of Cadereyt, who are associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the published information, 8 persons were detained in Los Alveros at the first attempt on 11 November and one detained person was able to be released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured and confirmed to be members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another raid took place on 12 November at 6 pm. Military staff was on a tour in Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta when he noticed cars without a license plate and in it two persons.
After stopping the car, they ran a search and discovered one rifle, a casing, and 18 rounds.
Then, on the basis of these statements, on 13 November, around 1400 p.m., one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was arrested.
They were charged with illegal burial in the villages of General Terán, China and Cadereyt.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present him with a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country above the abyss of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country over the abyss of the economic disaster and that has put the whole euro area at risk.
The Presidential Palace issued a report stating that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of his talks with the political parties in an attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase", said the former European Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked", he added.
Monti has completed the process of government creation in less than three days, which is much shorter than usual, while Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has led to an unsustainable level of debt.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve the tough package of austerity measures that European leaders require, only in this way will it be possible to restore the broken credibility of Italy.
Monti is under a lot of pressure to hurry up, and because of the instability of the markets, they exceeded the interest on Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year maturity of 7 percentage points, the level when Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian employers' organisation Confindustria, told the journalists after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much".
We believe that this government is the last option to get Italy out of this dire situation.
Monti’s hope for success was greatly multiplied by the support from PDL Silvia Berlusconi, who was forced by the crisis on Saturday to resign.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," she told the journalists Angelina Alfano, the mystery of the mid-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is important, because up to this point a number of its members were opposed to the government with a technocratic majority, which Monti is building up.
Parliament support
The new Monti government must have strong support for Parliament to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti started negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth organisations and women on Monday.
The round ends on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, who made it possible in response to the crisis to a very rapid course of action.
After a short decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond interest returned to the critical limit, responding to uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 trillion, would be beyond the current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti stated that his government should stand in power until the next elections planned for 2013 despite general forecasts that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms and then declare early elections.
Monti stated that he would like to include policies in his cabinet, but the large parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to lead Italy out of the difficulties that the country has made due to financial pressure.
Political sources have indicated that mutual distrust and dissent between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures and governments.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish football players, ten will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 called players reached the number of 50 matches.
Huge contrast on the Costa Rica side, if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While world and European champions, the number one monthly FIFA rating, have a wide range of class A inter-selection matches on their account, Costa Rica only has Michael Uman's defender, who played 50 international matches as the only player.
This number reached last Friday in the game against Panama (2) at the stadium Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the Star Game and in the powerful clubs of the English first league have been active for over a year in league championships and home championships and high-level European championships such as the Champions League.
We must also add experience from the national Spanish team in complicated elimination matches for the European and World Championships to the previous one.
On the contrary, Costa Rican players have very limited possibilities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, a Concaf that is considered to be the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the biggest number of foreign matches from the Spanish team has a goaltender, Íker Casillas, who reached the former goaltender Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches last Saturday before England (O-1 loss in London).
Casillas will continue today against Costa Rica and will get a new record for Spain - 127 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's key player, has 106 matches in his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA together with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account. Among them already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and middle attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
A hundred times Carles Puyol and 97 games came close.
Follow Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fabregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and near Michael Umana move left wing Júnior Díaz with 48 matches and goalie Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 crossed the border of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side has the most interventions Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at National Stadium next Sunday.
We have waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself ensures that for them the possibility to play Costa Rica represents a dream come true.
That's what the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour on the occasion of the celebrations of 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20.
This day will be performed at the National Stadium at 7:30, along with the angel group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a demonstration from an interview whose entire transcript can be found on the website of La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican supporters this is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The way to Costa Rica is also our dream, which becomes reality.
In South and Central America, we've barely been there for the second time, and the experience we've had has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, and it's a beautiful country, and I believe we can stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally love the group here, fans experience these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your most rocking supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for such a long time.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people already talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Is that what's causing you more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've shown over the past 21 years have been in the past few weeks.
We've performed some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we've made it into shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we like jungles. For both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and her surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfers' friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf, so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we don't have any restrictions on what we can't do.
We will try to perform the best show with various songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think that part of it is because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them, and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten that already.
That's why the show is more interesting to us, which is why I think it's more interesting to people.
You've been celebrating this tour for 20 years.
If you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could've imagined that we'd be in one big rock band and that we'd stay in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given, and we feel that we can continue to play together.
We love each other, and we like to make music.
We're lucky to be able to look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group in which the greats themselves are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends, it does not happen very often.
From time to time a group will be formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We're proud to be part of Seattle.
Sometimes we play with some.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and it is an honor to be part of this movement that was created in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the normal duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we're all lucky that we're still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we're constantly interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and thanks to this we have managed to open up musical paths that allow everyone sufficient freedom for their own experimentation.
We trust each other, we appreciate the music of the other, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relation to the word glory was not easy. However, thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew, it gradually became easier and easier to find a balance.
We try not to go on tour too much because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came to music, you'll remember that you have to respect the music and what you've given her, and you can't be carried away by being famous rock stars.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and at first it was something spectacular.
As a band, we have existed for three years and we have never released an album until after Andy died (Andrew Woods).
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy as he was incredible how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, to laugh, to talk about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The National Las Robertas band will be commissioned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as forerunners?
Yes, production sent us videos with several designs and we liked this group the most. Therefore, we are curious about what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very amusing.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbitter's words live?
That's Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He's singing it, and I think he's adding it first.
Who affects you as a bassist?
A lot of people.
I'm the first to think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I can talk all night about bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge even though it's no longer in fashion?
I think we've all always felt a little bit separated from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I imagine groups that I referred to as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came into existence at the same time, and if music is valid today, it's something great, because it's music that's worth listening to, and groups like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever.
At first, your music had a slightly cloudy character and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting because I feel that in the new album there are a couple of songs that are lighter, but also there are songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very sad, although they may sound positive.
At both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and it's deeply dark.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or boyfriend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent this to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still be a gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was again hospitalized for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss suffered in the area of lower limbs by his treating physician.
72-year-old Fujimori, serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which he has been operated on four occasions and is already under medical control.
A Member of Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the television station Canal N that Fujimori will undergo tests in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases where they should find out why he hurts and why he loses strength in the lower extremities.
Aguinaga said that, in his opinion, Fujimori could have been pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but the former President himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times because of tongue cancer, he dropped 18 kilograms, and other malformations such as severe erosion gastritis, cysts on the pancreas, kidney stones, high pressure, and circulatory problems in his legs were added to these problems, said the doctor.
Fujimori has served his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate for Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people who killed the killing squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his government.
Mujica visiting Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the Uruguayan President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, which aims to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political topics of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felip Calderón, on Wednesday. It is the most important meeting of extensive meetings with politicians, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will be used to exchange information on political matters between the two countries", the Uruguayan presidential office published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Caldénó to support Uruguay in a dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that the countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community, with a negative opinion from Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. G20 is a group formed by the most powerful developing and developed countries of the world. Since January this year, the Latin American country has had an agreement on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has sought to specify fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the "Black Charter" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which countries which have not introduced all the required international tax cooperation standards.
From the commercial point of view of Mexico and Uruguay, since 2004, the FTA has been concluded, thanks to which the exchange of goods between the two countries has been strengthened.
The bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the ties of the evil Bowser, but never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to all stores around the world, has already been made up from the beginning to use all the features offered by the portable Nintendo 3DS console that allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses works," said a press officer specializing in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is the "first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier", because up to this point successful images like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
The spokesman Nintendo stated that, in addition to the 3D image, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth batch.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can go into the "second round" at the levels of the game that are more demanding this time.
In addition, users can choose the real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome the various challenges and "do not subject to optical illusions".
This new start of Super Maria in 3D also assumes the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays a note to those who watch the saga and repeat a successful formula from previous parts. It is that the plumber of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in movements, in the surroundings, in disguises and also among the enemies, will also appear "playful" Luigi.
Colom approved the issue of Portilla to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had taken steps on the issue of the release of former President Alfons Portillo, who was to be accountable in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This concludes the process aimed at Guatemala responding to the request of a northern country that requires the issue of Portilla so that it can judge him.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judicial and executive powers and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered an extradition.
He assured that during his term of office he did not "interject" in court decisions and authorised all the releases that had been given to him on the table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and serious harm to health and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colome's step means a step in the execution after all the judicial and constitutional courts have been exhausted to lead the trial against the former President, who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and respect for human rights will be guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the matter of embezzlement of 120 million at the Ministry of Defense at the time of his presidency. This trial preceded the release, but the Public Ministry appealed and brought the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6000 young men in danger
The organization was created to help children without education so that they would not be on the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the Trijov social support organisation is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped to overcome the difficult situation for 25 years.
To this end, a long hundred jobs are to be added which have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday’s anniversary also served to introduce a balance sheet in the framework of a solemn act that took place in the former production sites of Fabra i Coats, which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was established in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, work, drug addiction or social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organisations and institutions who have cooperated with the association in the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Trijov.
Together with President Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education advisor, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current ecological-socialist Councillor Ricard Goma took part in the solemn act.
The big hall of Fabra and Coats was also attended by current advisers for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and general manager of social work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was created in a very difficult time and that today also presents a number of obstacles, but he added that the work that the association has brought to this day "is a good foundation".
The President has set Trijova as an example of how to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not new for this organization and for the work it does," he said.
There was an eviction of a taken house where giant parties were held
Aliens own 11 of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 invaders left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All this suggests that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors at number 51 on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building yesterday at noon, which they were illegally living in, where they organized giant parties that would raise neighbors, leaving the building without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation had been completed, the lock on the door was changed to avoid repetition of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," said the administrator.
The invaders who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partly water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving the garbage behind all kinds, especially cans after alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments had huge parties that lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building there's a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that, while the building was occupied, sales dropped by 80%.
The disco owner points out that the building's invaders were making her a unfair competition because they were selling drinks for 3 euros, whereas it costs 10 on the disco.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the charges of the neighbors for noise, but the problems were not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the residents of the house taken away, and especially by those who attended the parties organised here, whose frequency and intensity increased in recent weeks, according to the angry residents of the surrounding area.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months he had forgiven her rent.
The city police have also confirmed that over the past few weeks they have received more complaints from their neighbors about the situation.
The President of the People's Party Group at the City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for "the building to be evicted immediately and thus put an end to the problems of civil coexistence suffered by its neighbours and the destruction of the area".
The president explained that only one floor was taken the summer ago, but in the last months the invaders had reached all the floors of the building and almost all the flats, and in one of them even stolen.
In this respect, he added that "the impunity must be ended and consistent with the actions against civil responsibility that took place in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 o'clock, the police got into building 35 on Mont-ral Street after she was summoned by the neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four of them were arrested immediately.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of writing the proceedings, which carry with them more than the field of fees
The city's 16-gate selection procedure reopens the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, at the time of the greatest flowering, the already defunct Corporateación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this government printed several pamphlets to support the Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, he was complemented by a numerical comparison with New York Central Park.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the main border of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
Collserola's classification as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with the savages instead of Yoga bear.
This was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions at the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, is recording the idea of the park.
Either that, or someone's trying to put the gate on the field.
The only question, then, is Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organisational point of view and from a reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already a subject as sharp as when two members of this old caste chosen to shake hands at the meeting in the elevator.
And it was this work that triggered one of the rare coincidences between what the three Barcelona architects think and the preeminent university professors.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is justified.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf side began, "it is necessary to discuss also the "mountain side", so that Ildefons Cerd's speech about green apples was not brought to an end.
"We must base ourselves on the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, by its great availability.
Collserola is more complex", said the architect, for whom the name "gate to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as the definition of zones where it is possible to operate".
Modol, like Roldan and Bayona, with experience in the urban world, qualified the design as the "inttellectual challenge" that presents "some danger".
The dangers of "uncertainty, which today represents a public place project" following the experience of the 1980s, which in the area of the Forum had "its swans singing".
The first concern is the definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"Thinking something means taking the next step," it's basically moving one step further.
"It is important to keep in mind the new urbanist and planning tools, because the present ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster".
If we focus in more detail on the question, Modol considers that the hillside of Collserola can be considered as a park, but not a part of Barcelona for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already a work done by Patronat de Collserola, which "must not end up in the trashyard", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its grémia that it will intervene in the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, it understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "doubts" that it should be this very technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", it adds), which must be created: "Architects should be only tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex, because the selection documents lack the global vision of Collserola: "There have been 16 selection procedures that deal with all the axes of the mountain - sea, but there is no longitudinal study to look at and understand the area as a whole".
This causes at least him to sign up for all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the project of one gate can impact the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
In his view, the City Hall should guarantee that the zone directly above Ronda de Dalt should secure the whole length of the equipment zone, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino has forgiven Jonas Larrazabal, who will be released
After 72 days incarceration, the legal attorney Cadino Red granted grace to Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazabal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after being granted a pardon before the Second Criminal Court in that district, which discussed the extortion case in which Mayor Monterrey's brother was accused.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas was asked to pay for the economic quota to allow the city hall in Monterrey to allow an illegal operation in the betting house.
After a public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal prosecution against the panist mayor's brother.
Then, after 4 hours spent in front of the Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison One, located in Barrio Antigua, the capital of the state.
In this place, he remained for the next 49 days after a second incarceration order was issued and a public ministry agent refuted the possibility of complicity or organised crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyt Criminal Court for suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casina Red by one and a half million peso. However, he remained only a few hours in a medium-sized prison because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in San Nicolás de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October he was given an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence was collected to prove Jonas' guilt, for example, the payment of an amount of 1,5 million peso to the representatives of the casino in exchange for the promise that the operation would be possible.
This Monday, legal agent Casina Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region.
During a legal hearing with a representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been corrected and who of the partners had decided to grant mercy.
On the basis of an official file of 197/2011, legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazabal. In the process against him, no complaint will be possible. Nor can it be claimed for damages or punishment.
After a trial with a legal attorney around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanez, arrived at the San Nicolás de los Garza prison to inform Jonas that he had been granted official pardon and his case had been postponed to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome presented details of the plane crash in which the Secretary of the Governor Francisco Blake died, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of an accident investigation involving the death of the Secretary of the Government of Francisco Blake Mora and seven others show that the helicopter has landed directly on the ground with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt forced landing.
At the press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jacome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, stated that the pilot had stated that the weather conditions allowed prior to the start of the aircraft.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit has come into contact with the terrain several times, the wings have been involved in a tree branch 25 meters from where the unit has lost its hull."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons, therefore meeting all the requirements for the transfer of personnel.
Moreover, he stated that, following an investigation in the field of impact, no parts were found on the ground.
"When searching it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, the aircraft therefore hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for the transport of persons.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of airports and auxiliary services, stated that at the time of the impact, a helicopter from the President's General Staff was moving at a cruise speed and an accident occurred on a soft rising terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a common transit operation," he said.
At the press conference, the representative of SCT Pérez Jácome listed six core points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, the flight was carried out according to the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate take-off conditions, according to which the aircraft is moving to the border, and between DF and the State of Mexico there have been apparent layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouds the crew sought a lower area and greater visibility up to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last recording of the helicopter from the radar are consistent, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight trajectory prior to impact.
Dispersal of aircraft remains in restricted territory:
The information currently available allows us to assume that an impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The design of the dispersal of the aircraft remains indicates that at the time of the impact on the mainland the helicopter was solid.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident that there was an explosion or a fire.
The recent results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is considered, the height of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
Photographs show the images that were likely to break down along this route.
The information provides elements that seem to suggest that the helicopter may have come into contact with the country in several places.
After a thorough search in the vicinity of the accident, the territory that is more extensive than the territory of the demarcation was not found remains of the helicopter, which strengthens the presumption that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still solid.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance began research into the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for the obesity of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute for Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it conducts research to reveal a gene that causes obesity in children and young people. A research called "Genetics of Obesity in Children and Youth" will provide results regarding overweight.
In a report by the Head of the Biochemistry Research Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team composed of doctors, nurses, nutrition professionals and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and students from the National Institute for Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, with or without authority, can also participate in research. People can come to participate in the IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where each council will carry out youth tests from 8am.
He stressed that the research began at the Sport Centre Cuauhtémoc (Mexico State) and that since 8 October this activity was also carried out in the Sport Centre Nezahualcoyolt (East of the Mexican State).
Once data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Independencia Sport Centre (south of the Federal District) and finally at Morelos Sport Centre (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to trace risk factors to Mexican children and young people, thus preventing the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, the aim is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about the physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, circumference of the waist) are performed, blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genes are determined (to identify genes that contribute to child obesity).
Cruz López stated that this research reflects health professionals’ concerns about the alarming increase in the child’s weight.
'The health polls carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that only a 77% increase in obesity occurred in boys and a 47% increase in girls. A dramatic increase also occurred in the case of overweight,' said an IMSS expert.
He stated that one reason for finding indicators is that the population of the country is different from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African, which is reflected in genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general obesity genetics are commonly explained as inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits of the participants are that they receive an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thereby determining whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark colour wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm suggests the probability that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-sugar conditions.
In the meantime, the information is confidential, the doctors are giving it to their parents in writing, explaining to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make in order to avoid their children’s illness.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary life-styles that mean a lack of daily physical activity, day-to-day sitting before television and the use of means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Overweight also causes a large caloric intake, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and protein content and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no excavators in Asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers to create a mixture of better functionality, regardless of climate conditions and temperature
If the paving was properly cared for, almost 200,000 excavators would not need to be repaired after every rainy season in the Metropolitan region of Valle de México, Raphael Herrera Najer, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemicals (FQ) of UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavings were adequate, there would be significant restrictions on excavators or could even be completely removed.
In his lecture, the Technological cause of excavators, which he gave during the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his direction develops modified asphalts with polymers, which should produce a mixture of similar characteristics as asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najer believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, thus improving functionality and reducing the formation of excavators.
He explained that the asphalt, the most difficult part of oil, is a group of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a large molecular mass, called asphalts, and others with a low molecular weight, which are called maltenes. Together they supply asphalt with a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic character of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it acts like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in solid condition, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperatures, warned the expert on chemical engineering.
A scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with a flexible pavement consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers there is an asphalt insert, consisting of small stones covered in asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that makes up the insert is filled with asphalt.
It is possible to decompose the forces in the pavement during driving or under pressure.
If it were a modified asphalt, it would have spread even better, says the chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt insert there would be the last layer called the cape, consisting of fine stones, i.e. sand also covered in asphalt.
Given that this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have a greater mechanical force than the asphalt liner and must ensure the friction of the road.
As part of the paving, the cape must be of sufficient thickness and be careful of the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially moisture and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that needs to be remembered. In particular, water has a great influence on the function of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inside and it's hard to get out, it causes the softening of all layers of the pavement and thus the formation of excrets.
He explained that during the formation of excavators, the film will be the first to destroy the coat and then damage to the asphalt insert occurs. However, there is no damage at one moment, but it is a slow process that should be stopped at the first signs using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the burden on vehicles is another important factor in the formation of excavators, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of pavement must correspond to the weight of vehicles and it must be ensured that this burden does not exceed, so that we can prevent the frequent formation of excrets.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that we still have a lot of work to do with asphalt, and research is at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available in the market in other countries, allow us to easily repair the outlets without having to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to become Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramirez Serna did not get Miss Colombia's crown.
That's how Valle gets the 14th title first multimiss.
Valle del Cauca has not once again reached the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramirez Serna had to settle for being on the stage of the winners, getting a silver crown and a sherpa on the basis of which she became the new first multimiss Colombia.
On the basis of the results of yesterday's finals in Cartagena, where she won and took over Miss Atlántico, the department won the 14th multimiss. Melina joined a crowd of women from the Valle del Cauca who reached the reach of the crown, but finally announced the first moremiss. These include Miriam Ospin Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The question that many are asking.
The result is the defeat of the great favorite woman, who in all previous rounds showed that she had the chance to become Miss Colombia, and not for nothing became the Queen of Police and the prettiest face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were reached, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to appoint her only the First Multimiss is that she did not convince her answer to the question: "Which book you liked most and why?", by Martín Murillo Gómez from Leamos' literary editor.
The candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I believe it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was "The Little Prince", a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of global literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. It is a beautiful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This response was not pleased because of the term "culturalization" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned had noted to her.
After the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and happy for the outcome: "The world is wise what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can. Little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
The Bogot journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was the most popular, most celebrated, and that she received all the previous awards (the Gastronomic Challenge of Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen's mother), raised the envy of the other candidates, stressing the Queen, which then burned down on the stage.
It was visible during the first presentation of the swimwear on Hilton beach and during two shows before the final coronation.
Even though she was glowing on both, she was aware that she lacked the strength and the heat that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the Canal RCN, believes that Melinda has won the title of the first multimiss confirms the fact that the candidate, who will receive the most titles during the competition, does not eventually leave with the Queen's crown.
In addition, Valle has held a rather unkind attitude towards the media in recent days, and this has not been worth it.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Only on the edge, two days before the election, the international member of the jury, Lucy Doughty, stated that she was looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In Miss Colombia, beauty is not enough in itself, it is also necessary to see something more than physical beauty. We need to focus on social feelings. It is important that the candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was apparent on her buttocks. This is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the queen, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the problems with the bottom fibrosis, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took away her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos believes that Valle’s native woman made a mistake by undergoing several surgical procedures.
"Surgical intervention is fine, but they failed in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit and here she chose her tax."
Because of this award, which was granted for the first time by the National Assembly of Beauty, there was a cruel prediction after the swimwear show, which was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo allowed Melina not to finally give her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina has launched today a year of her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions where she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, he will enter history as one of the queens who, despite the overwhelming success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
That was the work of the Cali citizen, who identified the corpse of Alfons Cana.
A fingerprint expert from Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alphonsa Cana".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th last year, a fingerprint expert from CTI, Cali, entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader Farc: "Alphonse Cana", through a comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at CTI this week, Eliazar González, a man from Puert Tejad, who has been working for 21 years in the field of forensic research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to go through the forest for more than five days to get to a place where there were corpses that had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle, and after attending the relevant courses, he began to specialise in fingerprints.
In the week of the operation against that Alfonso Can, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guirerilla in the world. That's why they asked him to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillerm Leon Saenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team to the place where the corpse was, he did not recognize him because of physical insight. He looked completely different from the media.
He didn't have a beard, he was dressed like a villager in a given area, without glasses, much thinner.
But prints don't lie.
Along with the galton lupus, the ink and the transplanter and Eliazar's light, he began to compare the dactile records of the corpse with the credit card records.
The eye didn't disappoint him: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm to Secretary of Defense Juan Carlos Pinzón whether he really was the highest commander of Farc.
_Other Organiser
For a dactyloscopician from Sijín de Cali, the recognition given to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference of operational services against "Can" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help in investigating crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they're caught, a lot of delinquents present false documents or don't have papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and find them in the database.
The investigator told us that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the house's wall because at this point the thief was leaning to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for prints, but in this case we could get a print of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts" he recalled.
Fingerprints may also confirm or disprove suspicion in the case of a murder.
They found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him recently.
The investigation found that one of the family members might be responsible for the murder, and the impression on the bottle actually confirmed that.
Even though it's impossible to fully confirm that he was a real killer, it's obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
The CTI fingerprint expert explained that the items "stirred using chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, a transplanter or tape is used for its collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the database of the offenders, or to the Register.
"The problem is that at present there are still many Colombians whose data are not entered anywhere," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Like everything that sparkles, there's no gold, not everything that you touch, there's no trace.
However, if it can be used, a corresponding comparison must be made.
"Indignation" protests in New York
Hundreds of protesters were in distress at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waited for an order to clear the area and moved to the nearby park.
Members of the Cast Wall Street movement provoked representatives of New York on Tuesday, trying to get back to Manhattan Square, where they were taken out in the morning, and then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of demonstrators were in distress at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to go through a court order that allows the "enraged" to return to the site. The second part of the movement responded to the extermination by taking the park in the north of the city where there was further detention.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in a different place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through assembly and peaceful manifestations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the Wall Street movement.
Bray pointed out that the response of the "infuriated" to the eviction of the camp, which was ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg himself, reached a court-martial, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting violent eviction and allowing manifestos to continue to establish here.
In addition, "indignation" took away another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and the farm grounds in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came in and arrested some of the manifestants. Bray did not know the exact number, but he said he saw that the handcuffs had been put on by some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site, and a delegation of religious leaders has also come to express their support and to try to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, is expected to take place on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the shifted protesters even distributed and distributed copies of a court order and even gave them to members who were guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes", said Bray, who condemned the fact that some policemen beat up the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from moving out members of the Ocupa Wall Street movement or applying "laws which were published after the occupation began, or prohibiting the manifests from accessing the park with shops or other places that had previously been used".
Mayor Bloomberg said to the press that, in view of this court order, the city suspended the re-opening of public space and the manifesto pointed out that local laws do not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city's Supreme Representative personally defended the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation where 200 people were detained and joined because the manifestos "broken the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered to evacuate the square because it was "a place where people did not go to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases hurt others" because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbours were worried about the quality of their lives".
"The morning extermination was shocking and shows Bloomberg's attempt to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," said the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor that "he does not appreciate freedom of expression".
The representatives of the Ocupa Wall Street movement also stated that they were planning to organise "big events" for Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to remind them of the two months that protests lasted, since they began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will present the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a lifeguard in "Baywatch", a bunny in "Playboy", a wife of a year-old musician Tommy Lee, and now an actress and a model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show in Canada.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs by Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage of a television program in which Anderson, also known as Internet home pornographic images, appears with her ex-husband, the engine Mötley Crüe, Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus.
As Joseph appears on stage Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently served as a host on the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Krome Anderson and Peters will appear on a special Christmas broadcast CTV, the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March, who is close to controversy.
Recently Bublé called American Kim Kardashian one of her concerts in New York a fox.
After the devastating earthquake, Japan returns to life
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption and ends the period of downfall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, now recovering from the devastating earthquake that has been growing into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have quantified material losses to $300,000 million, a wound that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of the fall, the value of GDP reached such a position between July and September that it was possible to turn the page definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
The results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year starts in March 2012 - also assume the highest growth rate compared to the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery that is necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses have increased their investments by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% from January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on an impulse that forces us to use the crisis to come out of it stronger or to restore infrastructure, making use of the shortage to start completely from scratch.
Japan has woken up, especially due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma yenu
Flows were placed in the hands of the internal market when yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the 'saving values' for investors who are running from the debt crisis from the euro area and from the disturbing US forecasts.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their weak results in July to the course of yen in September.
While markets continue to be besieged by the EU's peripheral countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is prudent.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase of yen", said the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) made it clear that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts the inflexibility of the world economy, showed that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It dropped by four tenths to 100,4 points compared to 100,8 points in August.
The euro area even got below the average, which is located at level 100. It reached the level of 99.13 points.
Athens spreads uncertainty again
Papadimos says that austerity measures will be approved, but Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty that has once again taken over, Greece is increasingly entangled in the labyrinth, which leads to the exit from the large debt crisis in Europe.
The belief that the 'conformity' of the new transitional Greek government is being made to the demands of Brussels rather than the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he was given at his appointment would probably be short for their application, the President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, stated that the new austerity measures would not in any way support and repeated his request to write new elections on the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26 October", said Papadimos yesterday during a parliamentary debate which will culminate tomorrow by voting on the confidence of the government.
The 24 programmes to support employment, the reform of the Disciplinary Code of Officials and the new tax evasion measures will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message by Samaras does not make clear any doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have made no commitment to anything else."
The Conservatives' President went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF, to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but at the same time he stated that he would not support and sign any commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, angry at the impact that the referendum had caused Papandreus to play, stressed yesterday that its requirements were not exceeded: it will not block any aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors from the Trinity would return "very soon" to Athens and discuss with the new government what "what it needs to pay the sixth part" of 8 billion.
The Greek weasel has a little bit more to be confused about.
Queen Sofia: "There are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain 'has achieved a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance'.
Yesterday, Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet as regards this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is that it is "a tool of social progress, of justice and of a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in man".
Yesterday the Queen launched the 5th World Summit of Microloans in Valladolid, convinced that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Objectives set by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the targets to achieve a reduction of half the number of people who live with less than one dollar per day, i.e. an amount that sets the threshold for poverty".
Spain 'will continue to work' and expand the network of volunteers 'in all corners of the planet and take this task responsiblely', stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, 'will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women', to whom these loans are primarily earmarked.
"We have achieved many things" and "a lot of challenges are still ahead."
The microloan summit is to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "basic goals".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is to ensure that 175 million poor families have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that 100 million families get above the poverty threshold they currently live under.
The concept of microloans spread to Spain and to other states of the world after "the pioneer of Muhammad Yunus's idea went on this journey", said the Queen and added that it was "an act of justice and the necessary recognition".
She described this instrument to her father as "a admirable idealist who went on a journey to fight poverty". She met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet directly on the spot with his loan policy.
The first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as the Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006. "At all these meetings, I could see continuous development, the Queen explained, thanks to her support for this project, the title of "The Head of the Family", which was granted to her in Valladolid by "the movement of the poor".
Queen Sofia finished her performance by calling on the participants to engage in discussions and finding solutions, thereby allowing them to continue to fight poverty.
"Ethical Empire"
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, stated that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" which must be governed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the period of Balohodism, because this cooperation is a 'permanent duty'.
Jiménez believes that microloans are "serious and fair policies to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever, governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, a microloan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The state secret for international cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to people whom everyone else closes the door. Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the participants in the city, which "opens its gates to the spirit of solidarity which is contagious".
The CDU proposes to vote for the European President on the basis of general electoral law
Without serious difficulties for Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig on the first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it was only in autumn, especially to be satisfied by the members of the party who consider government policy today to be lax with the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow with the Italians.
The proposal for a President of the European Commission led by the Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine out of 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes' ovation comes to the conclusion of Angela Merkel's performance and then a few hours later Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: a response to the crisis "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because 'the nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
According to the Chancellor in Europe, "the time for change has come".
This could be reflected by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general electoral law 'in order to give Europe one face'.
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: the UK is opposed, and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same position.
But the direction is set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected the proposal by a large majority to assess the weight of each country in the Board of Directors of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in a strengthening of the weight of Germany.
She was worried about calming down the climate inside her party, the Chancellor made several references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she did not try to get congress talk about "small" European states or states that are in trouble, willing to criticise arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal for a Europe refers to one paragraph of the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that there was a bloody battle at Leipzig just two hundred years ago.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What is a work incapacity fraud?
After the aid, the UMP party and the government are launching offensive against incompetence.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be visiting Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 December, and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will speak on the topic repeating since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As a background to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased severity, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity.
First, due to budgetary savings, the government intends to force private sector workers on the fourth day of their incapacity to work before they start taking support in the disease.
Clearly, without the consent of the company, the employee who gets sick would lose four days of pay, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring EUR 280 million.
Also, measures that would be accompanied by further measures of symbolic scope: to give public employees one day of unscathed incapacity (yet they have no incompetence compared to three days in the private sector).
While these questions are being discussed, the right-wing majority is also launching a topic of fraud focused on crimes linked to incompetence.
"The controls will be much more extensive and, in addition, if you are caught, you will return", warned Xavier Bertrand during an interview with the station RTL on Sunday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about the iniquities in work.
These have, in fact, been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political pressure that brought their fruitage.
French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM) more than EUR 237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health in 2008, daily refunds represented 5% of health expenditure in 2008 with €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity contributions and accidents at work and 54% related to incapacity, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of the health costs.
According to the Alma Consulting study, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that hides some deviations: another survey published in 2007 on Monster.com’s employment website showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees questioned replied that they had not chosen a working day.
Another study, carried out this time by institutions of sickness insurance, states that in 2010 37.8% of incapacity was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% took longer.
When compared with their European neighbours, French workers are not more prone than elsewhere to incompetence.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence (health reasons or not) in France was between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Incompetence fraud represents only a very small part of the work in black.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only small.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks aimed at incapacity for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that at 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of the 285,000 were carried out because of short-term "unauthorized or too long" failures, i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacity over 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorized" were calculated at 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132,000.
A total of 169 000 "unauthorized" cases for several million workers who had incompetence.
A number that represents much less than the number that expresses black work.
According to the UMP Dominiquea Tian, author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent between EUR 9 and 15 billion missing in the annual tax collection, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday, December 14th, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos gave these words to Parliament and added that a hundred days of unity given to his government would not be sufficient to fulfil this task.
"In order to put our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget", said the Head of Government when he gave his first public speech on Wednesday at the start of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the euro area summit will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is in the game, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country’s public deficit would be around 9% of the gross domestic product from now until the end of the year after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support by means of measures already approved in order to try to escape from the debt crisis, but he pointed out that his party did not commit to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures", stressed Samaras at the meeting with the Members for his side of the New Democracy.
We have agreed on targets for reducing deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the envisaged measures, said Antonis Samaras that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the Committee of Experts
According to a report from the Royal Canadian Society, death is denied to the Canadians.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society is living up to the idea of rebuffing death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the possibility to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report of the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Commission recommends that the government amend criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, if this choice appears necessary for a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning, experts quote a recent poll by an independent Economic Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada is number 10, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, they tell us experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite wishing to die at home, which has most Canadians, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this number is highest with 86% of the people who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report draw conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that there is nothing to change about criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also checked all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered to be a criminal case, there is no evidence that this non-criminalisation is causing any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons inadequate or incompatible.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downnie, a co-author of the report, confirmed more than numerous cases of these overexperts yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicides are not legalized.
"The euthanasia is also performed in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is also committed in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are inclined to euthanasia
Let us recall that, according to an investigation by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of the Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that they will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the lives of the elderly or the disabled are less valuable.
With regard to persons practicing assisted suicide, 41% believe that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear about maintaining or discontinuing patient care, say the authors of the report.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that criminal law state that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not a criminal offence.
The Commission of Experts also requires professional doctors to be educated to respect the obligation to refuse treatment at the end of their lives without fearing criminal prosecution.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final silence already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Commission requires that it be considered when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain, to be euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a medical specialist, qualified the position of experts-signator of the report as "extreme" because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the patients in the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 years old could ask to help him commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the résumé of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that it looks like the authors of the report have built the autonomy of a person above all the other values that form the social element of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".
Medical specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strength objections to the conclusions of the report that she qualified as a "manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, a member of the Royal Canadian Society herself, doubts in particular the dates of the report concerning the absence of error in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicides are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the U.S. State of Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus talks about "complotion."
Syria is becoming more isolated
The followers of Bashar al-Assad manifested yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressures on President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists and speaks of the "complotion" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in Liza Arab States, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, adopted an opinion in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan yesterday was the first ruler of the Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to kill in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the military forces of the regime," handed over power".
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have had to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, the neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the efforts made to facilitate Turkish mediation under the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned by success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he commented on neighbouring Syria, against which Turkey is increasingly applying a tougher line.
The United States rejoiced at the "strengthening consensus against Assad and the unfair conduct of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"International Community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey are applying an increasingly harsh tone" to the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced, during this time 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime forces were killed in Deraa, South Syria.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed during the shootings and the concentrated shooting of heavy machine guns in the town of Jobar in the Homs area.
However, at the press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country "went out of the crisis".
In fact, he also reacted to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus's membership, which, according to him, constitutes a "hazardous step".
Syria "will not bow," he added with assurances that "comploquities entangled against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering the Civil Protection Mechanism and intends to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favourable to the idea of sending UN observers in order to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime that he believes is "paranoid".
The new Special Meeting of the League calls for tomorrow to be held in Rabat to take a position on a plan to resolve the crisis decided on 2 December, and which was expected in particular to withdraw the armies from the cities affected by conflicts and the liberation of the incarcerated manifestos.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, considered yesterday's decision by the Arab League to be "false", while China encouraged Syria to adopt a resolution plan, while completely avoiding supporting any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time and victims of Italians
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start applying a program that will include "sacrifice" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of trade unions and employers today.
It should establish a relatively thin cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to the parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the designed Prime Minister.
The President of the House of MEPs, Gianfranco Fini, expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament to express his confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with the introduction of a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness of the financial markets and asked them for time.
In "democracy, the exact terms apply" as regards government preparation and its programme, he stressed and added that he was confident that the markets would be patient and understood".
His appointment as president was initially favourable in the markets, but concerns resurfaced after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team involving, in particular, technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept "politics".
He expressed his conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini's new government will be given the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mario Monti promised to act with extreme urgency after taking up his post and to make Italy a strong article again for Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesperson stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union is convinced that Rome, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, will not achieve its objective of a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new hard measures.
The Head of Business Union Confindustria Emma Marcegagli, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to reinvigorate the economy"for a country that does not show growth cannot comply with the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors, "a call for seriousness" and "other Italy", represents for Italy "epotential change" after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The great unknown will be the life of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place government bonds for EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used for nuclear weapons, announced an American non-governmental organization specialising in atomic risks on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAAE) and other documents leaked from this UN agency.
Last week, the IAEA announced its "serious concern" regarding the "probable military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the Institute of ISIS widely drawing on the documents of the IAEA, V. Danilenko (born 1934) was to work for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet Military Research Centre in Cheljabinsk (Ural), where he was to produce synthetic diamonds using the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, the centre was to leave to set up a "nano-diamants" company in Kiev.
His economic difficulties should have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia he was then to cooperate from 1996 to 2002 on the Iranian programme.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked during a substantial part of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of the country from which he came".
Anti-Muslim crime and delinquency increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of criminal acts and delinquents directed against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violences slightly decreased or little increased.
According to these figures, the overall number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% increase compared to the procedure by 13% in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in violence against Jews and a 14% overall increase in anti-religious crime and delinquency.
The total number of "hate crime" rose very slightly to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% were FBI- motivated racial differences and 20% religious differences.
"After the decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and delinquents rise again", said Human rights First, "The increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", she added in her communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims as well as all forms of hateful crime must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must do more to deal with these crimes", adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on "hateful criminal acts".
"Hate crime" in American federal law is the legacy of a time of civil rights struggle.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin, and now also sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and resembles more Facebook
The website providing microblogging services Twitter introduced changes in design on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of successors, which somewhat resembles its Facebook services.
New offers "action" and "name" allow you to know better and directly the activities of other people who follow you or people whose answers ("tweets") you follow.
This allows you to know whether they allow you to monitor the contributions, whether they apply to new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested"in August on a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, she told the AFP spokesperson of Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeated dissemination of the contribution of someone else, followfriday pour commander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'uvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniament plus compare a celei des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately assess the importance of this innovation in their "tweets".
"It's unnecessary, it takes up a lot of space and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Function Activities will better help me track some of my Twitter features", sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
the inclusion of a golden rule on a balanced budget in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to enter the 'gold rule' of budgetary policy into the Constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid any reduction of the rating of Austria by credit rating agencies (AAA).
It was the socio-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the conclusion of the ministerial meeting in a situation where the Austrian public debt is with its 74.6% high above the criteria of a maximum of 60% established by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria were reduced by just one step from the AAA to the AA+, we would have to pay EUR 3 billion more on interest every year", argued the multi-officer and foreign minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria follows up on a request from the Eurozone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where Heads of State or Government strongly asked for the reduction of the public deficit and the balance of public accounts to be entered in the Constitution or the law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a " Rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be able to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal countries as well as the municipalities will have to show a balanced budget.
The objective is to get public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty in the period 2020/21.
Strong Only
Noda threatens new intervention on foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again on foreign exchange markets if only he had to continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find excessive instability" in the exchange rate at the yen, explained to Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, he only went up to the historical values that the Japanese authorities forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling dollars for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency that just recently exceeded the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But since then, it has been regularly growing supported by purchases of investors who consider it a "safe port" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar again came under 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below a symbolic bar of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar had a value of about 120 yen and more than 160 yen.
This inflame of the Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when transferred into their domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by March earthquakes and tsunami waves, which have devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who is afraid that this dearness will not yet be killed in the eggs of fragile recovery.
The third economic power of the world has restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% relative to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year, thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of disaster-intensive households.
But the Prime Minister considered that the high value did not simply reflect the "national economy of Japan".
The Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the multi-governor of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that BoJ had previously taken "appropriate measures" suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Securities Issuing increased the ceiling of various securities purchases by EUR 5,000 billion (EUR 47 billion) and increased to EUR 55,000 billion (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling for the purchase of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates rise, storms fail
The risk of a debt crisis still undermines European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European exchanges are still concerned about the stability of the euro area today on Tuesday 15 November falling into negative expectations.
In Paris at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax Index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
"With new tensions around the yields of euro area loans in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make only a part of recent profits".
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an IG Markets broker, quoted by Reuters.
The storm in Tokyo was closing down with a decline of 0.7%, which has suffered due to the concerns of market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes fixed on Europe, and the shift will only continue in a tight corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stable", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This relaunching of uncertainty about the future of the euro area damages the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been getting to the lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency is $1.3570 at 0.4%.
According to the brokers, the currency was withdrawn after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party accepted a proposal at its congress on Monday to leave the euro area for countries in difficulty without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain very worrying.
This morning, on Tuesday, the yield of Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of South European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time on the markets to remedy the situation in Italy, threatened by the stress of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the euro area summit would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in the deliberate line of markets when elections to the Chamber of Deputies take place in the country on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("read") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
Predicting euro area growth figures
Statistical figures say that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter due primarily to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies of INSEE revised downwards by 0.1% of GDP in the second quarter instead of stagnation.
And truthfully, it's the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
For its part, during the same period, Germany registered an increase of 0.5%.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 o'clock, while the European Commission has just pointed out the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must win over the dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural for the election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that takes on energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development is about to create a double demand for electricity by 2050 if we do not want to rid a significant part of the world's population of life.
At the same time, the lack of fossil resources will need to be faced in order to continue to generate electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject currently disappearing from environmental debates.
An accident in Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.
That is why Germany itself remains in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case of Belgium, which is subject to its decision the need to find any other resource capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which considers it appropriate to build only the power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue their commitment to their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by restoring the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant crash.
When a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, reality opposes it.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence on gas imported in particular from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of natural gas and coal plants.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European champion of wind power plants, which receives 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas because of the irregularness of the wind, which is why the CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are higher by 65% or 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the invariability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay an electricity invoice 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised economy energy costs represent a key factor of competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of industry on national territory, French companies benefit from the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make an illusory beautiful statement on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of the purchasing power.
The price that the large majority of French refuse to pay, just as it does not essentially oppose this energy, as the polls of public opinion show.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has enabled the sector to be built with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 downstream jobs.
The highly exporting sector carries a large number of SMEs creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad to international markets.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have lost EUR 6 billion a year for the exports of nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while its manufacturer would be planning to fail?
In solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, even that there is no devilic.
The development of low CO2 emissions facilities and renewable energy facilities by the French industrial group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Nuclear Safety Authority, which carries out uncompromising and transparent surveillance of existing nuclear power plants, as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of blood security.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island was in normal operation and remained without human victims and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, drama caused the concept of a reactor and unexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident just as it did from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to the competitors of the AREVA Group and EDF and releasing the way to take the lead in nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best solution to energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogma and machinations dominate the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
Immigration policy for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the jamming of police, courts and administration-submissive policies, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "the country of human rights", which France boasts.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment whose object was foreign students, which became actual when the Minister of the Interior (see Libération of 23 May) stated that France "does not need foreign talents, masonry and waitresses".
But so far, it has rarely been discussed at the angle of the economy.
It is necessary to say that there is quite a broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
On the right hand note in 1976 Jacques Chirac stated that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where there are 2 million migrant workers" and on the left hand side of Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "must not accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invasion of hordes of Polish plumbers on the French territory was shared on the right and on the left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity we want to give to immigrants.
In its programme François Hollande is limited to banality, stating that joint development will enable us to solve our "migrational problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and problem is perhaps in the elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definition Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): among the specialists there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
Restriction of immigration hampers growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and put pressure on reducing their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than replacements for French workers by doing jobs in sectors with a shortage of workers.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not sufficient to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this addition between the French and migrants causes the arrival of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And yet it does not consider the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to creating ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries on average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany one immigrant coming at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (revenues minus expenditure) to public budgets in her lifetime (incomes minus expenditure) of EUR 150000.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his mandate that he wanted to go for the missing percentage of growth "with the priced teeth".
The affected teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, we have to think about European democracy.
Democracy is rare and very fragile.
The European continent should remember this, though he invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some people may have believed that, in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to make the choice and carry it out as directly as possible.
Yet, it is known from Napoleon that this was an easy way of thinking.
The general electoral right, although necessary a condition of democracy, is not sufficient and can become a "hitter tool" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been the same since the start of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The confession of a Greek referendum of the yes-no type in this respect will have the value of double revelation: to reveal the need for a large return of political power, but also to reveal the alarming feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today and that many Republican warriors are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we require a number of national referendums organised according to necessity and disorganized.
Bianko exposed to the European absolute monarch or jumping with his legs tied to an empty nationalist depth: what choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want a guillotine knife, but a common, full-right, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not even know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe in a position to dictate markets and credit rating agencies that suffer from their incompetence and their lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe, which is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it every one of its nations.
The management of the European democratic sovereignty project must be brought back urgently.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debt, to rid themselves of market governments and to prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will presuppose decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After fighting against this socialist proposal and Jacques Delors for a long time, everyone today is demanding a strong demand for a European economic government.
Fair enough.
But thinking it without stronger political and democratic integration, and being experienced as such, would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We must take on a new phase of European building.
In order to establish the Republic in France, it was necessary to "be" Republicans.
The revolution in its interests couldn't have been enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building a Europe more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"No contact" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere it will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris the world's chip card fair.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, the year 2011 should end with an increase of 11% in the worldwide sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM-card phones) on more than 6 billion units.
The most carrier is a segment of contactless technology, which allows you to pay in bulk transport or to make purchases just by approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold worldwide 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should rise in 2012 (a expected 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total market for chip cards (6.925 million cards).
After being long in the APEC tow countries, Europe is gaining land in contact free payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
In order to rank higher speed, the banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute their bank cards systematically in the future", announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Paying With Mobile
But this is only the first stage to pay for the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary for the execution of transactions is now equipped with only a small number of devices.
"They've been delayed."
"But their real momentum should take place next year."
"For 2012 we estimate their sales in the world of 80 to 120 million units", explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing forward.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Generale reported yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay without touching her mobile phone.
The terrorist front ranges from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
Long-term suspicions that there are associations by the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messachel even admitted that Algiers had "became certain" about it from now on.
"The way both organisations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them", he explained without further clarification.
It seems Paris has similar analyses.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help to illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being kidnapped by members of the AQMI from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation conducted by special French troops.
In the rubble after the hit, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorism axis
Analysis of calls made leads to several persons in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, which is a cradle of Boko Haram, and the other leads to a man who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"It is progress, but it is undoubtedly necessary to wait for more convincing evidence before we begin to talk about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active," said Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more obvious in the development and expression of Boko Haram or in its operating procedures, which now include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
Since then, the international community headed by Washington has put pressure on Nigeria to consider the problems that Boko Haram has created.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Quick Success
The secta Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusufa. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin" in the language of Haoussa, approves the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
There is a rapid success in this poor region.
The sect is policyd and requires strict respect for Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters are launching a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s supporters become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
The government's reaction is still the same as usual.
The army will surround the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the cult Mohammed Yusuf is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its position in the north.
At Christmas 2010, he will carry out an assassination in Jos, where 80 people will die, then another in the capital of Abuja.
In June it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, from now on concerns all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaida of Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and Iger and the Somalis of the Al-Shabaab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week, in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France is in an emergency state and is ready to "send all information".
The world according to the presidential candidates
On issues relating to China, Iran or Israel's aid, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are exorcising simplification and ignorance.
Can America’s weakened crisis manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
When listening to presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated their noisy statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran, and Israel’s help are intertwined.
Mitt Romney, the best-place candidate for the Republican nominee "Grand Old Party", threatened to challenge the Chinese before the World Trade Organisation and their accusations "for manipulating their currency", a topic in America enraged by the migration of all parts of its industry towards Asia.
Even worse, if this must contain the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama's ambassador to China, and the only candidate with any sophisticated vision of foreign politics, nearly went off in a attitude that "smooths" emotion.
He required a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is last-minute in the polls, remains disobedient.
In the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions fail to stop his nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in Fanfaron.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase his military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of disappointing in his duties to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, second best placed candidate, proves the embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stand against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing"trys to develop nuclear capacity" - apparently unknown fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas’s governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike against Iran, says about himself that he is ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
They are all far from being a Republican candidate, John McCain, in 2008, heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple thoughts and yet won the Cold War.
They remind that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the rash departure of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus give him the label of the weak
But the attack isn't easy.
The population assesses President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positive.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military intervention that leads to overcrowding.
And with the argument that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking on a more correct place.
Nord Stream, the new Russian gas port to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance gas pipeline connecting Eastern Europe to Russia, led to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, began to work.
They must supply a gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part in the inauguration of the Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together by controlling the control valve of the Russian gas input to the West European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional Cuban metres of Russian gas will flow every year through the 1 224 km pipeline connecting the St Petersburg region to the Mecklenburg-Pomeranian Federal Land.
The second pipeline, which has to be completed at the end of 2012, will allow the supply of a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is equal to the total French consumption.
The possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route is already being recalled.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge building is a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries protested strongly against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany without being led by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At one point, these two countries are losing some power: the ability to push Russia with threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw most expressed this when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means saying that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained greater confidence in its purchases with its support for this Russian project.
But it is at the price of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created a gap between the East and West Europeans.
Russia managed to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western states with high gas consumption, whose bearings are nearing their end, just five years ago.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us", confirmed François Fillon at the opening ceremony and demonstrated at what point the large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the wide smiles of the leaders of Gazprom present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The submarine pipe is made of steel fitted with a concrete shell to protect it from the anchors of seagoing vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea in an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid minefields from the Second World War.
"For safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, spokesperson of Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as 242 Eiffelvek, which is not interrupted by valves or maintenance stations throughout its length.
One control platform should have been built near Sweden, but the project manager rejected it when the Swedes were little willing to see the Russian state company settled permanently off their coast.
"In case of a fault, we stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline shall escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, since welds were designed to create a leak once every 100,000 years.
The external gas pipeline check is carried out by an underwater robot drawn by a ship, while the inside of the gas pipeline is controlled by a device circulating inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 metre is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
In the target, 3 m/s speeds will provide accurate information on possible metal parts deformations throughout the three-day journey.
The long-range gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces for the implementation of this project.
The leadership remains Gazprom, which holds a 51% share.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as by the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, commissioned by the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
The company has its registered office in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely favourable.
Gasprom subsequently leased this company for five years by a contract that can be renewed, all its capacity for the transport of gas.
"Gazprom will profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported", states Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% of the shareholder and 70% of the bank loans.
The total cost of work should be €7.4 billion for both pipelines.
Therefore, the investment costs for the GDF Suez group amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be returned to them, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
Gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
Ventiles at a height of 4,5 metres form the exit gate of the gas.
Sensors shall measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
With full capacity, it will be 3 million an hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - marker notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to give once again the pleasure of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, the hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
Moleskine is easily distinguishable by its black rectangular plates and its white sheets as if they were aged in time.
Moleskin's notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to place on the market a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is to assume the introduction of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of the skin), which is used for the treatment of the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was greatly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine returned to popularity an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a brand leader at the company Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle down to 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is remote from classified production from the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw up an artificial portrait of a buyer, as the notebook will attract businessmen as well as students or professionals.
The image of Moleskine is that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultured, and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, has almost 100 of them today, and since 2008 it has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to the bookstore and through the chain of FNAC stores into small boutiques in the city centers where he could enforce his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the turbulent development of e-mails", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: recently the brand opened the exhibition " Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarn Film Festival, she also introduced new notebooks resembling the leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifyes its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand extends to a wide range of carriers.
A success that sparked envy: in autumn 2006 Modo Modo was purchased by the investment funds of SG Capital Europe, today Syintrava Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is there such a high share of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today is the 15th week for employing handicapped people.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled persons is twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it depressing?
"No, underlines the Éric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the employment of disabled."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At the time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher."
"There's still so much to do."
It should be said that many obstacles remain for unemployed disabled persons before their entry into work.
These are older people: 37% over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a graduation, and of 2.3 million university students there are only 10,000 disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for handicapped compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make return to employment particularly complicated and which represent the "core of the problem" according to Christian Grapin, CEO of the Tremplin Association, established in 1992, to help businesses receive disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
Unspoken remains, ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slow.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cite found that the interviewed managers have a weak level of knowledge of the handicapped persons" s"excessive idea of persons in the chair and mental or mental deficiencies".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The most recent known figures, which come from 2008, indicate a state equal to 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, responsible for charging fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence is the number of "remunerated" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59.000 more guilty companies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "How lucky"
Before they call on French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens on Tuesday night (20h45), they did not hide the pleasures that would bring them this friendly game.
We're not going far enough to write that there was an association between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the stands of the auditorium of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, the Belgian coach gave only the words of praise to his player.
"I am very happy with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the French player Lille.
As for the difference between his performances in club games and national team matches, "it is one thing and the same, he is justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not a case with Belgium."
"You need me to clear my brand."
The gambling investigation against Romania on Thursday night because of this fight against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "light".
You can't forget the term "joy".
To play against Bleus, who has been encouraging since the age of 7 and in their victory campaign in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
That's all the more because across from "there are Mathieu (Debuchus), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", reminds.
"We crossed each other immediately."
"The power to play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Leekens kindly reminded me of "respect."
"Worship" to fight the "Fight-Fight."
"Worship" also stated in the quality of "neighbourhood", that France was a little more than a year after trauma in the South African city of Knysna" again became a very high-level team."
"Laurent Blanc has done an enormous piece of work," he has breathed.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European Championship, a technical footballer would like to see him in 2014 on a plane with the French towards... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he underlined.
"We're just building something, players are ambitious, they're healthy hungry."
"Conscious it for the next game," including France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts this Wednesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams lacked realism on their way there.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt for him. The Portuguese football team, with its steering wheel since 2010, has been qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
One game left and one opponent left - Bosnia.
Knowing the outcome of Friday's Bombay0) in the hell of Bosnia's Zenice, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour’s advantage, but was unable to score such a rare goal as to relieve it.
"It is a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we have not scored a goal outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of an audience, which should create a boiling boiler there, although the match certainly appears to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but brightly considering Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be on Euro 2012", said Carlos Queiroz.
The indecisive Friday game in Bosnia is forcing Portugal to score and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for the Bosnians who also need a goal.
"It is a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we did not score outside", regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team of high-tech and high-quality players," he added.
Just as in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in the Bosnian team right from the beginning of the maximum pressure so that they don't give them time to think."
Good idea, on condition that it turns out to be realistic this time.
